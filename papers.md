UPDATE: Click [here](https://github.com/fedebotu/ICLR2023-OpenReviewData) for ICLR 2023 data!

## Descriptions

This Jupyter Notebook contains the data crawled from ICLR 2022 OpenReview webpages and their visualizations. The list of submissions (sorted by the average ratings) can be found here.


## Prerequisites
- `python` 3.7
- Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * NOTE: You can also use [edgewebdriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) on Windows environments by changing the `path` variable in the `.py` scripts


## Crawl Data
1. Run `crawl_paperlist.py` to crawl the list of papers (~0.5h).
2. Run `crawl_reviews.py` to crawl the reviews (~1.5h).
   * NOTE: currently only review ratings are crawled.


## Visualization

**Keywords Frequency**

The top 50 common keywords (uncased) and their frequency:
