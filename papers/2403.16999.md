# [Visual CoT: Unleashing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multi-Modal   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16999)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual tasks but lack interpretability and struggle with complex visual inputs. 
- They fail to mimic human visual comprehension behaviors like focusing on key regions and lack visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities.
- Existing datasets lack intermediate bounding box supervision and MLLM pipelines rely on static image contexts.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a Visual CoT dataset with 373K samples, each with a question, answer and intermediate bounding box highlighting the key visual region for answering the question.
- Propose a multi-turn MLLM pipeline that can dynamically focus on visual inputs. It first predicts the key region relevant to the question, processes the localized visual information, and then integrates information from the overall and localized images to construct the answer.

Main Contributions:
- Visual CoT dataset across 5 domains with intermediate bounding box supervision
- Novel multi-turn MLLM pipeline with dynamic visual focusing and intermediate interpretable thoughts
- Introduction of visual CoT benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on focusing on key local regions 
- Experiments demonstrating pipeline effectiveness and analyses providing insights into visual CoT strategies

The paper makes important strides in enhancing MLLMs with more human-like visual comprehension through visual chain-of-thought reasoning and dynamic visual focusing. The dataset, benchmark and pipeline serve as an encouraging starting point for further research directions.
