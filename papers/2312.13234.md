# [Position Paper: Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and   Sensitivity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning (ML) and sensitivity analysis (SA) are two fields that have developed largely independently, despite having significant overlap in their goals and methods. 
- Many techniques originally developed in SA have later been reinvented in ML, without proper crediting of the original work (e.g. partial dependence plots, functional ANOVA).
- There is untapped potential in applying SA methods to interpret ML models and vice versa.

Proposed Solution:
- Formally define the ML pipeline as a complex system suitable for sensitivity analysis. This system includes functions like the model inducer, hyperparameter optimization and model explanation methods.
- Show that existing interpretable ML (IML) methods can be seen as performing sensitivity analysis on components of this system. For example, IML methods analyze how predictions vary with changes to input features.
- Argue that IML is essentially a form of SA applied specifically to ML models and processes. This viewpoint integrates IML methods into the broader SA literature.

Main Contributions:
- Provide a formal framework to view IML methods as SA applied to an ML system. This clarifies relationships between methods.
- Call attention to the overlapping goals and methods between the fields, the lack of proper crediting and the potential for cross-pollination of techniques.
- Discuss how additional SA methods could be used for interpreting ML models and processes.
- Highlight how SA concepts around auditing and workflows could benefit IML research.
- Present arguments for greater collaboration between the ML and SA research communities.

In summary, the paper argues that the goals and techniques of IML and SA significantly overlap, and that formally viewing IML as an application of SA could lead to better fundamental understanding, more rigorous practices and acceleration of research progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that interpretations of machine learning models and the model-building process can be seen as a form of sensitivity analysis, a general methodology used to explain complex systems across many fields, in order to direct attention to overlooked related work, establish a unified framework, and exploit potential research gaps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is formally establishing a link between machine learning interpretability (IML) and sensitivity analysis (SA). Specifically:

- It argues that IML can be seen as a form of SA applied to machine learning models and systems. This provides a unified framework to view and develop interpretation methods.

- It formalizes the ML pipeline as a system of interconnected components (data, model induction, tuning, evaluation etc.) that is suitable for global SA. Existing IML methods like PD, ICE, Shapley values etc. can be seen as estimating sensitivities within this system.

- It discusses how many IML methods relate to and have origins in the SA literature, but have been rediscovered in ML. Bringing both fields together allows properly crediting previous work and exploiting potential research gaps.

- It highlights how additional SA methods could be meaningfully applied for model interpretation, and how IML methods could explain complex systems in other disciplines that use SA.

In summary, the paper bridges the gap between IML and SA, integrating them under a common perspective for explaining machine learning systems. This allows exchange of ideas and techniques between the fields.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that interpretations of machine learning models can be seen as a form of sensitivity analysis. What are some key advantages of viewing model interpretations through the lens of sensitivity analysis? How does this perspective allow us to integrate and leverage work from other fields?

2. The paper formally models the machine learning pipeline as a system of interconnected components. What are some of the key functions and variables in this system model? How does modeling machine learning as a system enable new forms of sensitivity analysis and interpretation? 

3. The paper discusses applying both existing and novel sensitivity analysis techniques to machine learning. What are some examples of traditional sensitivity analysis methods that could be valuable if applied to machine learning models or the model-building process? What adjustments might need to be made?

4. How can concepts from sensitivity analysis like factor prioritization and factor fixing be useful for providing formal settings and definitions around model interpretability in machine learning? What gaps could this help fill?

5. The paper argues sensitivity analysis has more extensive practical application workflows compared to interpretable ML. What are some examples of workflows and best practices from sensitivity analysis that could inform approaches in interpretable ML?

6. Hybrid modeling aims to integrate both process/theory-driven and data-driven models. How could sensitivity analysis aid in analyzing, interpreting, and advancing such hybrid approaches? What unique challenges might arise?

7. The paper discusses model-specific sensitivity analysis for artificial neural networks through methods like saliency maps and ablation studies. What are some pros and cons of specialized neural network interpretation methods compared to model-agnostic techniques?

8. How could novel interpretable machine learning methods like ICE plots, partial dependence plots, Shapley values etc. prove useful if applied to non-machine learning systems? What additional challenges might arise in such applications?

9. The paper does not focus extensively on causal inference and unsupervised learning. How might sensitivity analysis relate to interpreting causal models or providing explanations for clustering outcomes? What open questions remain?

10. Beyond the topics discussed, what other connections between sensitivity analysis and interpretable machine learning could be fruitful areas for future investigation? What gaps currently exist at the intersection of these fields?
