# [How well do LLMs cite relevant medical references? An evaluation   framework and analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are being considered for medical question answering. However, there are concerns about their propensity to hallucinate information not backed by evidence.  
- In medicine, providing accurate references is crucial for building user trust and avoiding potential patient harm from erroneous information.  
- Evaluating the quality of LLM-generated medical references has been limited by the need for expensive expert annotations.

Methods:
- The authors propose an automated framework called \textit{SourceCheckup} to evaluate LLM reference quality without human verification.
- Questions are algorithmically generated from medical documents. LLM responses to these questions are parsed into statement-source pairs that are automatically scored by a Reference Verifier module.  
- The Reference Verifier comprises the GPT-4 model fine-tuned to determine if a statement is supported by an accompanying source text.
- The authors demonstrate high (88%) agreement between GPT-4 Reference Verifier decisions and expert clinician judgments.

Experiments and Results:  
- Five top LLMs were evaluated on 1200 generated medical questions using three quality metrics related to validity of provided URLs and extent of statement/response support.
- The best performing LLM was GPT-4 (RAG), aided by search engine access, but still âˆ¼50% of its responses had unsupported statements.
- Without search access, other LLMs had 40-70% invalid URLs and could fully support only 7-22% of responses.
- Questions from Reddit elicited poorer performance than professional medical sites for all models.

Contributions:
- A scalable evaluation framework to score LLM medical reference quality without human verification
- Evidence that leading LLMs still perform inadequately as medical references 
- A dataset of algorithmically-constructed medical questions and expert annotations

The paper demonstrates an important gap in existing LLC capabilities to reliably provide medical evidence. The proposed benchmarking approach enables continued assessment of progress in this crucial facet of trustworthy medical LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an automated evaluation framework called SourceCheckup to assess how well large language models can provide relevant references to support the medical statements they generate in response to questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose an automated evaluation framework called \textit{SourceCheckup} to assess how well language models can provide relevant sources to support the medical statements they generate. This framework includes modules for question generation, parsing LLM responses, downloading source URLs, and automatically scoring whether sources support the statements using GPT-4 as the source verification model.

2. The authors demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves high agreement (88%) with a panel of medical doctors on scoring whether sources support medical statements. This helps validate the accuracy of using GPT-4 itself for automated source verification instead of relying solely on expert annotations.  

3. The authors evaluate five leading commercially available language models (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, Gemini) on over 40K statement-source pairs across 1200 medical questions. They find major gaps in the quality of sources provided - between 50% to 90% of statements are unsupported depending on the model. Even retrieval augmented GPT-4 could fully support less than half of its responses.

4. The authors release an open source dataset of 1200 medical questions generated from reference texts, along with expert annotations for 284 questions to serve as a benchmark for future evaluations.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions around developing an automated evaluation pipeline for medical source verification in LLMs, benchmarking current model performance, and releasing data to standardize future assessments. The key findings highlight important limitations around trust and accountability of leading LLMs.

- Trustworthiness
- Fact checking

The paper proposes an automated evaluation framework called "SourceCheckup" to assess how well large language models can provide relevant medical references to support the responses and claims they generate to medical questions. It uses GPT-4 to automatically generate medical questions, collect LLM responses, parse the responses into statement-source pairs, and score each pair on the relevance of the source to the statement. The paper shows high agreement between GPT-4's scoring and expert medical doctors, enabling a scalable analysis. It evaluates several top commercially available LLMs and finds many of their statements are unsupported, highlighting a gap in capabilities. The key terms reflect this focus on evaluating medical LLMs' source verification abilities using an automated pipeline.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an automated evaluation framework called "SourceCheckup" to evaluate how well LLMs can provide relevant sources to support their medical statements. What are the key components of this framework and how do they work together?

2. The paper shows that GPT-4 has high agreement (88%) with doctors in verifying whether LLM-provided sources are relevant to the LLM's statements. What dataset was used to demonstrate this and why is it important to have an automated verification process rather than relying solely on manual expert annotations?  

3. The paper evaluates five commercially available LLMs on source verification using the SourceCheckup framework. What were the key differences in performance between the best model (GPT-4 with RAG) and the other models without access to search engines?

4. Even with search engine access, GPT-4 (RAG) still failed to fully support its statements around 50% of the time. What are some potential reasons and failure modes that could explain this gap?

5. The paper breaks down source verification performance by the question's original source (MayoClinic, UpToDate, Reddit). What trends were observed and why might certain question types be inherently more difficult for models?

6. Beyond source verification, what are some other complementary metrics that should be used to evaluate overall LLM quality and safety in medical applications?

7. The paper emphasizes evaluating whether LLM statements are grounded in sources rather than directly assessing claim accuracy. Why is this a useful paradigm for auditing LLMs instead of just manually verifying each statement?

8. What are the key implications of this work as it relates to regulation of medical LLMs and their adoption in clinical practice? What governance gaps does source verification highlight?

9. The paper releases an open source dataset of medical questions, LLM responses, and expert annotations. In what ways could researchers build upon this dataset for future work?

10. How could the SourceCheckup framework be extended to other domains like law or journalism that also rely heavily on sourcing facts to textual evidence? What modifications would need to be made?
