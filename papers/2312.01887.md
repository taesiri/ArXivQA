# [Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring for Feeder-Level EV Charging Detection:   Sliding Window-based Approaches to Offline and Online Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01887)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging detection at the feeder level using non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques. The authors develop a sliding window approach to extract time series features from aggregated household load data, including statistical measures and peak counts. Three types of sliding windows are utilized: forward-looking, centered, and backward-looking. Lightweight machine learning models like XGBoost and random forest are leveraged for the detection task. Experiments using synthesized multi-household feeder data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for both offline and online EV detection scenarios. The model achieves strong performance with F-scores of 98.88% and 93.01% for offline and online detection respectively using XGBoost. The work provides an effective solution to understand EV charging behaviors on distribution feeders, offering valuable insights for utilities and system operators. Key strengths lie in model simplicity, feature engineering, versatility for offline and online detection, and interpretability.
