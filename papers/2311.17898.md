# [Knowledge Pursuit Prompting for Zero-Shot Multimodal Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17898)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a new framework to enhance the quality and faithfulness of visual content generated from text prompts. KPP recursively queries external knowledge bases to obtain factual details related to the initial prompt. These details are aggregated by a language model into an enriched prompt fed to a black-box generative model like Stable Diffusion. A key advantage is KPP is zero-shot - it does not require retraining or parameter access. Through contextual knowledge pursuit and language model prompt enhancement, KPP is shown to produce higher quality and more realistic visual synthesis (images, 3D, video) across multiple datasets compared to baseline approaches. The modular design also enables flexible choice of language models, knowledge sources, and generative models. Overall, KPP offers an effective prompt interface to strengthen factuality and richness of visual synthesis from text in a generalizable manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework that iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content without needing to access or train the generators.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a zero-shot framework called Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP) that iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce more reliable and high-quality visual content from text prompts. Specifically:

- KPP recursively queries informative facts from a knowledge base to gather context that provides additional details and semantics to enhance generic prompts. This knowledge pursuit process is adaptive and contextual.

- An language model is instructed to aggregate the acquired knowledge context into a structured prompt catered to different downstream generators (e.g. for images, videos, 3D rendering). 

- The prompt enhanced by the aggregated knowledge can be fed into black-box generative models to synthesize more faithful and high-quality visual content in a zero-shot manner, without needing to fine-tune or access parameters of the generators.

- KPP is demonstrated to enhance text-to-image, text-to-3D and text-to-video synthesis across diverse datasets. It has flexible components and can generalize to multiple modalities, showing potential as a unified prompting interface.

In summary, the key novelty is a knowledge pursuit framework that gathers informative context to enhance prompts in a zero-shot way, leading to improved visual synthesis from black-box generators without additional training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Knowledge pursuit prompting (KPP): The main framework proposed in the paper for recursively querying external knowledge to enhance text prompts for multimodal generative models.

- Zero-shot synthesis: A key capability of KPP is enabling high-quality and faithful visual synthesis without requiring access or retraining of the generative models. 

- Text-driven generators: The multimodal generative models conditioned on text prompts to produce images, videos, 3D renderings etc. KPP is evaluated on models like Stable Diffusion, DreamFusion, ZeroScope.

- Knowledge aggregation: The process in KPP of using a language model to parse the retrieved knowledge context and compress it into a structured prompt catered to the downstream generator. 

- Recursive knowledge query: KPP queries facts one by one, with each fact retrieved based on relevance to the current context. This allows more expansive gathering of relevant knowledge compared to static retrieval.

- Faithfulness: A key focus of KPP is improving faithfulness and reducing hallucination in visual synthesis compared to generic prompts.

- Modality-aware instructions: KPP can adapt the prompt enhancement process to different target generators by tuning the instructions to the language model.

- External knowledge base: KPP leverages Wikipedia passages as the source of factual knowledge to recursively retrieve from.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP) framework recursively query external knowledge bases to gather informative facts and context? What is the algorithm or strategy used to select the most relevant facts at each step? 

2. How does KPP instruct the language model to aggregate the queried knowledge context into a structured prompt for the generative models? What specific instructions or demonstrations are provided in-context?

3. How does KPP adapt the knowledge aggregation and prompt enhancement process for different downstream modalities like images, videos, and 3D models? What modality-specific considerations are made?

4. What quantitative experiments and analyses were done to evaluate the effectiveness of the sequential knowledge querying strategy compared to baseline approaches like static aggregation or retrieval?

5. How was the framework analyzed in terms of its modular design? What different language models, generative models, instructions etc. were tested? How did they impact performance?

6. What were the limitations of directly prompting the language model without any factual knowledge as analyzed in the paper? How effectively does KPP overcome those?

7. What data sets were used to train the generative models and evaluate KPP? What diversity of captions and domains was covered to assess generalization capability?  

8. How scalable and efficient is the recursive factual knowledge gathering process? What innovations could further optimize the knowledge curation time?
