# [The Reversal Curse: LLMs trained on "A is B" fail to learn "B is A"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12288)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Do large language models (LLMs) fail to generalize logical reversals of statements they are trained on? In particular, if an LLM is trained that "A is B", will it automatically be able to infer that "B is A"?The paper hypothesizes that LLMs suffer from what they term the "Reversal Curse", where models trained on facts in the forward direction ("A is B") fail to generalize to the reverse direction ("B is A"). The experiments in the paper aim to test for the existence of this hypothesized Reversal Curse across different LLM architectures and training regimes.In summary, the central research question is: Do LLMs suffer from the inability to automatically reverse factual statements they are trained on, a phenomenon dubbed the Reversal Curse? The paper presents experiments to test for this phenomenon.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Identifying and characterizing a phenomenon called the "Reversal Curse" where language models trained on statements of the form "A is B" fail to automatically generalize to the reversed statement "B is A".2. Providing evidence for the Reversal Curse through finetuning experiments on synthetic datasets, where models trained on name-description pairs in one order struggle to answer questions with the reverse order. Models show near 0% accuracy on reversed questions.3. Demonstrating the Reversal Curse holds across model sizes, architectures, and training setups. Data augmentation and auxiliary training data does not seem to help models overcome it.4. Giving tentative evidence that the Reversal Curse impacts practical generalization, by testing ChatGPT on real celebrity-parent facts. The model answers questions correctly much more often in one direction vs the reversed direction.5. Raising questions about why auto-regressive LLMs suffer from the Reversal Curse, whether other model families exhibit it, and whether it reflects a similarity to ordering effects seen in human recall.In summary, the paper identifies and provides evidence for an intriguing failure of generalization in LLMs, which they term the Reversal Curse. It highlights issues with bidirectional reasoning and integration of logically equivalent facts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in its field:- The paper focuses on studying the ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to generalize facts bidirectionally. This is a relatively new line of research investigating the generalization capabilities and limitations of LLMs. - It provides direct empirical evidence for a phenomenon the authors term the "Reversal Curse", where LLMs fail to generalize factual statements from "A is B" to "B is A". This complements other recent work using influence functions to study bidirectional generalization.- The experiments are carefully designed using synthetic datasets to isolate the reversal generalization issue. This is a strength compared to analyzing real-world datasets where many confounds can obscure the effect.- The authors test several techniques like data augmentation and multitask learning to try to alleviate the Reversal Curse, but find the effect persists. This helps rule out some potential solutions.- The paper investigates the effect across model sizes, architectures, and tasks, demonstrating it is quite robust. This thoroughness in exploring the scope of the phenomenon is a contribution.- While other work has shown LLMs can exhibit inconsistencies or fail on negated statements, this paper uniquely identifies the bidirectionality failure, which is surprising given the logical equivalence of forward and reverse statements.- The experiments focus on factual knowledge, but the authors discuss how the issue may extend more broadly to other types of relations. Studying generalization for non-factual knowledge is an interesting direction for future work.Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution by carefully identifying and characterizing an intriguing generalization failure in LLMs. The scope and rigor of the experiments distinguishes this work and advances our understanding of these powerful models. It opens up many questions for further investigation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Studying other types of relations to see if models also fail to reverse them, such as logical implications, spatial relationships, or n-place relations.- Using entity linking to find real examples in large pretrained language models' training sets where information only occurs in one direction, in order to analyze the practical impact of the reversal curse. - Further analyzing the mechanics behind the reversal failures in transformers to understand what properties prevent them from generalizing in this way.- Exploring whether the reversal curse hinders model performance on downstream tasks by preventing integration of information learned in different orders.- Testing whether non-autoregressive language models also suffer from the reversal curse or if they can avoid it. - Comparing to humans to see if some analogous effect occurs, though the authors note the complete failure to reverse they find seems more extreme than in humans.- Explaining the reversal curse - why it occurs in the training process of autoregressive LLMs.In summary, the authors suggest further probing the scope, impact, mechanical causes, and potential solutions to the reversal curse across model architectures, tasks, and in comparison to human learning. Their results open up many avenues for better understanding generalization in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper exposes a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) called the Reversal Curse. If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". For example, a model trained that "Olaf Scholz was the ninth Chancellor of Germany" cannot answer "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". The authors provide evidence through finetuning experiments on synthetic data and show that models trained on "A is B" facts fail to answer questions of the form "B is what?" even when prompted in various ways. Data augmentation and model scaling do not resolve the issue. They also find tentative evidence of the Reversal Curse in real-world knowledge, with GPT-4 able to identify parents of celebrities better than their celebrity children. The failure indicates LLMs do not learn the common co-occurrence of facts in both directions, highlighting a basic inability to generalize patterns beyond the training data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately without access to the full text of the paper, I do not have enough context to provide a meaningful TL;DR or 1-sentence summary. Academic papers often contain complex ideas and analyses that are difficult to fully capture in just a sentence or two. If you could provide more details about the paper's topic, findings, methodology, etc., I may be able to attempt a brief summary. But in general, a paper's abstract is usually the best concise overview of its key points and contributions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper exposes a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Llama-1. The authors call this the "Reversal Curse". The curse refers to the fact that if a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it cannot automatically generalize to answering questions of the form "B is ?" with "A". For example, a model trained that "Olaf Scholz was the ninth Chancellor of Germany" cannot answer "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?" even though the reverse logically follows. The authors demonstrate the Reversal Curse through finetuning experiments on synthetic datasets of fictional facts. They also find tentative evidence that the curse affects practical generalization in ChatGPT, which can often correctly state a celebrity's parent but fails when prompted with the parent and asked for the celebrity child.The authors hypothesize the Reversal Curse occurs because transformer language models update their representations in an asymmetric way during training. When trained on "A is B", the representation of A gets updated to incorporate information about B. But the representation of B does not get automatically updated to incorporate information about A, even though the statements are logically equivalent. The curse demonstrates these models do not properly perform the logical deduction or meta-learning that would enable generalizing the reverse direction. The paper raises questions about the robustness of knowledge learned by large auto-regressive language models. The authors suggest non-auto-regressive models may not exhibit the Reversal Curse, providing a direction for future work.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents experiments testing whether large language models (LLMs) trained on facts in the form "A is B" can generalize to answer questions of the form "What/Who is B?" after only being trained on facts in the "A is B" ordering. The main method is to create synthetic datasets of fictional people paired with fictional descriptions/occupations, such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of Abyssal Melodies." The authors finetune LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA on these datasets, containing the facts presented only in the "A is B" ordering. They then evaluate whether the models can answer questions like "Who composed Abyssal Melodies?" which would require generalizing and reversing the order.Across experiments with different model sizes, optimization settings, and content, they find LLMs consistently fail to generalize and reverse, exhibiting chance levels of accuracy on the reverse direction questions. This demonstrates the "Reversal Curse" where current LLMs cannot reliably infer facts of the form "B is A" after only seeing "A is B" during training. The paper analyzes this generalization failure and its implications.
