# [Adaptive Instrument Design for Indirect Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02438)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for adaptively designing experiments when direct randomized trials are infeasible and treatment effects must instead be estimated using instrumental variables. The key idea is to learn an optimal distribution over potential instruments that maximizes estimation efficiency. The authors formulate this as a reinforcement learning problem, where the mean squared error of the estimator serves as the reward. They introduce the use of influence functions and rejection sampling techniques to reduce the high variance typically incurred in policy gradient methods, enabling optimization even with neural network estimators. The flexibility of the approach allows it to work with a variety of linear and nonlinear estimators used in practice. Experiments across synthetic and semi-synthetic domains showcase that the adaptive design significantly improves sample efficiency over uniform sampling. By balancing sample and computational complexity, the method provides a practical framework for adaptively allocating interventions in situations where only indirect experimentation is viable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a practical computational procedure to search for an optimal data collection policy over instrumental variables in order to minimize the mean-squared error of the treatment effect estimator in indirect experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a practical computational procedure for adaptively designing a data collection policy over instrumental variables in order to minimize the mean-squared error of the desired (non-linear) estimator. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces influence functions estimators for black-box double causal estimators and a multi-rejection sampler to enable gradient-based optimization of a data collection policy $\pi$. This allows $\pi$ to be modeled using deep networks and supports various (non)-linear (conditional) IV estimators. 

2) Provides theoretical analysis to characterize the bias-variance tradeoffs of different design choices to balance sample complexity and computational complexity.

3) Empirically validates the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed approach on synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments conducted in domains inspired by real-world applications. The method is shown to significantly improve sample efficiency compared to uniform sampling.

In summary, the paper proposes a practical and scalable framework for adaptively designing instruments in indirect experiments that is applicable to a variety of estimators and settings while minimizing sample size. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Instrumental variables - The paper focuses on estimating treatment effects using instrumental variables rather than randomized controlled trials when direct intervention is impractical. 

- Indirect experiments - The paper introduces a method for adaptively designing data collection policies to improve sample efficiency in indirect experiments that leverage instrumental variables.

- Influence functions - The method uses influence functions to efficiently estimate the effect of each sample on the parameter estimates, in order to optimize the data collection policy.

- Multi-rejection sampling - A sampling strategy is proposed to enable off-policy evaluation of different data collection policies to find the optimal one.

- Gradient-based optimization - The overall approach involves gradient-based optimization of the data collection policy to minimize the mean squared error of the parameter estimates.

- Sample efficiency - A core goal is to improve the sample efficiency of estimators in indirect experiments by strategically selecting instrumental variables during data collection.

- Flexibility - The method is demonstrated to work with different estimators (linear, nonlinear, parametric, nonparametric) and experimental settings.

So in summary, key ideas include using influence functions and multi-rejection sampling to efficiently optimize data collection policies for instrumental variables to improve sample efficiency in indirect experiments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using influence functions to estimate the leave-one-out difference in mean-squared error. What are some of the key assumptions required for the validity of this approach? How might violations of those assumptions impact the performance of the overall adaptive experiment design framework?

2. The paper leverages a multi-rejection sampling strategy to correct for distribution shift when evaluating new instrument allocation policies. What are the key advantages of this approach compared to standard importance sampling? Under what conditions might multi-rejection sampling still struggle or have high variance? 

3. The paper advocates balancing sample complexity and computational complexity. However, the proposed method itself has significant computational overhead. In practice, what are some ways one could reduce the computational burden to make this method scale to even larger problems?

4. The method searches over instrument allocation policies by directly optimizing an estimate of the mean-squared error loss. What are some alternatives loss functions one could consider optimizing instead? What would be the trade-offs?  

5. The paper considers a batched allocation setting where the policy is updated periodically. How should one determine the optimal batch size and frequency of policy updates? What factors influence this?

6. A key condition for instrument validity is the exclusion restriction. When might this assumption be violated in practice and how could the method be extended to account for direct effects of the instrument on the outcomes?

7. The method assumes the treatment effects are homogenous across instruments. How could the approach be extended to account for heterogeneous treatment effects? What new challenges might arise?

8. The experimental results are mostly on small synthetic datasets. What adaptations might be needed to scale this method to problems with very high-dimensional covariates and instruments?

9. The mean-squared error objective does not account for uncertainty in the estimates. How could concepts from Bayesian experiment design be integrated into this framework?

10. The method focuses on sample efficiency for estimation. How might it be extended to optimize power for hypothesis testing of treatment effects or enable valid confidence interval construction?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of estimating treatment effects in settings where randomly assigning treatments is impractical or unethical. Instead, treatment effects must be estimated using instrumental variables that encourage but do not directly assign treatment. However, estimators based on instrumental variables tend to have high variance. The paper aims to develop an adaptive data collection strategy that selects instrumental variables in a way that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the treatment effect estimator, thereby improving sample efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to learn an instrument selection policy π that minimizes the MSE loss Λ(π). This is challenging because: 
1) The gradient estimator can have variance that grows linearly with dataset size.
2) Evaluating gradients for a policy different from the one used to collect data requires correcting for the shift in distribution, but importance sampling methods cause exponential growth in variance.

To address 1), the paper uses influence functions to reduce the variance of gradient estimates without needing to retrain models. For 2), a multi-rejection sampling method is proposed that avoids the exponential growth in variance of importance sampling. Putting these together gives a practical procedure to optimize π using gradients to search over policies modeled flexibly, e.g. with neural networks.

The approach is sequential - after gathering some initial data, π is repeatedly updated to minimize MSE on future batches. This relies on the observation that policy rankings based on MSE often remain consistent even as more data is acquired.

Contributions:
- A general framework for adaptive experiment design using instrumental variables, with practical procedures for low-variance gradient estimation.
- Handles flexible black-box estimators like neural networks commonly used with instrumental variables.
- Multi-rejection sampling method to correct for distribution shift without exponential variance growth.
- Demonstrates significant gains over baselines in both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiment domains.

The key advantage is the ability to improve sample efficiency and estimator accuracy by adaptively selecting good instruments for indirect experiments, while remaining computationally tractable.
