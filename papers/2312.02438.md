# [Adaptive Instrument Design for Indirect Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02438)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for adaptively designing experiments when direct randomized trials are infeasible and treatment effects must instead be estimated using instrumental variables. The key idea is to learn an optimal distribution over potential instruments that maximizes estimation efficiency. The authors formulate this as a reinforcement learning problem, where the mean squared error of the estimator serves as the reward. They introduce the use of influence functions and rejection sampling techniques to reduce the high variance typically incurred in policy gradient methods, enabling optimization even with neural network estimators. The flexibility of the approach allows it to work with a variety of linear and nonlinear estimators used in practice. Experiments across synthetic and semi-synthetic domains showcase that the adaptive design significantly improves sample efficiency over uniform sampling. By balancing sample and computational complexity, the method provides a practical framework for adaptively allocating interventions in situations where only indirect experimentation is viable.
