# [VideoDrafter: Content-Consistent Multi-Scene Video Generation with LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01256)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing video generation models focus on generating single-scene videos with a single event occurring in a constant background. Extending them to generate multi-scene videos is challenging due to:
1) Difficulty in logically arranging multiple events into a coherent multi-scene video. 
2) Lack of consistency for common entities (e.g. persons, objects) appearing across different scenes.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes VideoDrafter, a framework to generate content-consistent multi-scene videos. It has three main stages:

1. Multi-Scene Video Script Generation: Leverage language models to convert an input prompt into a comprehensive multi-scene script, describing key aspects like events, foreground/background entities, camera motion per scene.

2. Entity Reference Image Generation: Identify common entities across the script scenes. Enrich their description using language models. Generate a reference image per entity using text-to-image models to ensure visual consistency.  

3. Video Scene Generation: Two diffusion models - VideoDrafter-Img generates a scene-reference image per scene based on event prompt and entity references. VideoDrafter-Vid converts it into a video clip conditioned on action dynamics and camera motion.

Key Contributions:
- Novel use of language models to logically arrange multi-scene videos and ensure content consistency via entity reference images.
- Two specialized diffusion models, VideoDrafter-Img and VideoDrafter-Vid, to generate multi-scene videos in a content-consistent manner.
- Extensive experiments showing improved visual quality, content consistency and preference over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, VideoDrafter leverages language and diffusion models in an elegant framework to tackle logical coherence and content consistency issues in multi-scene video generation. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a VideoDrafter framework that uses language models to generate a multi-scene video script from a prompt, creates reference images for common entities across scenes, and generates each video scene with diffusion models conditioned on the script and reference images to ensure content consistency across the scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework called VideoDrafter for content-consistent multi-scene video generation. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Leveraging large language models (LLM) to convert an input prompt into a comprehensive multi-scene video script, which decomposes the video logically into multiple scenes with descriptions of the event, foreground/background entities, and camera movement in each scene.

2) Generating reference images for the common foreground and background entities across multiple scenes identified from the video script. These reference images serve as a link to ensure content consistency across the multi-scene video. 

3) Devising two diffusion models called VideoDrafter-Img and VideoDrafter-Vid to generate a multi-scene video conditioned on the scene-specific event prompts, entity reference images, and specified camera movements. VideoDrafter-Img creates a scene-reference image for each scene, while VideoDrafter-Vid converts that into a video clip.

4) Demonstrating through extensive experiments that VideoDrafter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference for multi-scene video generation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the VideoDrafter framework that can effectively generate high-quality and content-consistent multi-scene videos.

The paper proposes a novel VideoDrafter framework for generating high-quality and logically coherent multi-scene videos from text prompts. It utilizes diffusion models conditioned on descriptive scene prompts, reference images, and camera motions. A core contribution is enhancing content consistency across scenes through the use of LLMs to produce comprehensive scene scripts and generate reference images. The proposed VideoDrafter-Img and VideoDrafter-Vid components focus on image and video generation for each scene. Evaluations demonstrate improved visual quality, logical coherence, and cross-scene consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel attention module in VideoDrafter-Img that handles text prompt, foreground reference image, and background reference image. Can you explain in detail how this attention module works and how it helps in aligning the generated image with the reference images?

2. The paper generates a multi-scene video script using a large language model. What are some of the key strategies adopted to enhance the stability when using an open-source model like ChatGLM for this task?

3. VideoDrafter modifies the intermediate frames during the diffusion sampling process to reflect the camera movement specified in the script. Can you explain how this modification is performed and why it is done after the first few sampling steps instead of later steps?

4. What is the motivation behind decomposing the self-attention in VideoDrafter-Vid into spatial and temporal self-attentions? How does this decomposition help in improving the model?

5. The paper demonstrates the ability to use real images as entity references during multi-scene video generation. What are some potential applications that can benefit from this capability of customizing the appearance of objects and environments?

6. What are the main challenges in generating multi-scene videos compared to single scene videos? How does VideoDrafter address these challenges through the use of language models and reference images?

7. Could you analyze the tradeoffs between using GPT-4 vs open-source ChatGLM for multi-scene script generation? What are some limitations of both models for this task?

8. How suitable is the current framework of VideoDrafter for generating long, high-resolution multi-scene videos? What enhancements could help in scaling to longer sequences? 

9. The paper uses CLIP similarity between objects across scenes to evaluate content consistency. What are some other metrics that could be used to quantify content consistency in a generated multi-scene video?

10. What role does the U^2-Net model play in the pipeline? How does it help in ensuring clean foreground and background reference images are used for conditioning the video generation?
