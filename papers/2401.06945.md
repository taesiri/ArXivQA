# [Knowledge-Centric Templatic Views of Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06945)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Authors often create multiple documents conveying the same underlying knowledge for different audiences and formats (e.g. slides, reports, brochures).
- Past work has treated the generation of each document type as a separate task, leading to fragmented learning, redundancy in models/methods, and disjointed evaluation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a unified approach to generate "templatic views" of documents. 
- First generate a Structured Unified Representation (SURe) representing the key information from the input document.
- The SURe provides structure and filters unimportant details.
- Then use the SURe to generate various downstream document formats with minimal prompting.

Key Contributions:
- LLM-powered method to create a SURe and generate templatic views requiring no supervision.
- Demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines by using the SURe across slide, poster and blog generation tasks. 
- Introduce Template Agnostic Evaluation (TAE) - a unified precision-recall metric that works across templates.
- TAE integrates past metrics into a framework that accounts for content quality, structure/order, and length.
- Human evaluation shows humans prefer documents generated with SURe 82% of the time.
- TAE correlates more highly with human judgement than standard metrics.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to unify the generation and evaluation of templatic document views using a SURe, requiring no supervision and performing well across diverse downstream tasks. The unified framework is flexible and extensible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a method to generate structured unified representations of documents which can then be used to create multiple templatic views of the content, and proposes a template-agnostic evaluation framework that better correlates with human judgment compared to standard metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing a method to generate a Structured Unified Representation (SURe) of an input document using a large language model. The SURe captures the most important information from the input document in a structured format. 

2) Demonstrating that the SURe can be used to generate multiple templatic views of the input document (such as slides, posters, and blogs) with no supervision and very little guidance. The method is unified, adaptable, and requires minimal supervision.

3) Proposing a Template Agnostic Evaluation (TAE) framework that allows for automatic evaluation across different templatic views of documents. The TAE framework accounts for factors like content quality, structure, ordering, and length. 

4) Conducting experiments showing that:
(a) Generating documents using the SURe leads to improved performance over strong baselines. 
(b) Humans prefer documents generated using the SURe 82% of the time.
(c) The TAE evaluation metric correlates more highly with human judgments than standard metrics.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing methods for unified generation and evaluation of templatic document views, which are shown to be effective both automatically and according to human evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, I would identify the following as some of the key terms and concepts:

- Templatic views of documents - referring to different document formats (slides, posters, blogs, etc.) that represent the same underlying information
- Structured Unified Representation (SURe) - the intermediate structured representation of the input document generated by the authors' method
- Large language models (LLMs) - used to generate the SURe and final document
- Template agnostic evaluation - the proposed unified evaluation framework that can work across different document types 
- Panels - the concept introduced to allow the evaluation metric to generalize across templates by considering organizational units
- Precision, recall, ordering penalty, length penalty - components of the template agnostic evaluation formulation

The key focus areas seem to be: unified generation of different document types/views, adapting large language models for this through the SURe, and enabling standardized evaluation across document templates. The application domain is transforming scientific documents into other formats.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of a Structured Unified Representation (SURe) to represent the core content from a source document. What are some potential limitations or disadvantages of representing the content in this structured format compared to using the full text?

2. When generating the final templatic views from the SURe, the paper relies solely on prompting the language model without any finetuning or training. Why do you think prompting alone is sufficient and what types of documents or content might require some amount of finetuning? 

3. The template agnostic evaluation method introduces the concept of panels as a way to generalize across document types. Can you think of some examples of documents that may be challenging to decompose into logical panels? How might the evaluation framework handle such cases?

4. While the paper focused on scientific documents, the proposed approach is intended to generalize to other domains. What aspects of the method may need to be adapted to work properly on highly structured documents like legal contracts or financial reports?

5. The paper conducted experiments using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. How do you think model size or architecture choices may impact the overall performance? What ablation studies could provide more insight?

6. The human evaluation revealed that structure and content quality were main drivers of preference. How might you update or refine the method to improve performance on those dimensions specifically? 

7. Could the proposed approach integrate retrieval or knowledge source augmentation to improve the fidelity of the generated templatic views? What sources could help preserve key details?

8. What types of input documents do you think would be most challenging for the proposed method? Are there any assumptions about inputs that may not generalize well?

9. The paper focuses on text-only outputs. How could the method be extended to support multi-modal outputs like slides with images or videos? What additional prompting cues or structure could help?

10. The SURe representation uses a JSON format. What are other potential structured representations that could capture the key semantic content and how might they impact overall performance?
