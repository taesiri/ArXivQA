# [DriveAdapter: Breaking the Coupling Barrier of Perception and Planning   in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00398)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on a quick skim of the paper, it seems the main goal is to propose a new paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving that decouples the perception and planning components. Specifically, the paper explores utilizing a pre-trained "teacher" model that takes ground truth inputs to do the planning, while training a separate "student" model to only focus on perception and generate the inputs for the teacher model. This avoids having to train the planning component from scratch using behavior cloning, which can suffer from issues like causal confusion.The main hypotheses appear to be:- Directly feeding imperfect perceptual predictions from a student model into a teacher model will perform poorly due to the distribution gap between predicted and ground truth inputs.- Adding adapter modules between the student and teacher, with objectives to align features, can help address this distribution gap in a layer-wise supervised manner.- Further incorporating action guidance and masking during training can handle imperfections in the teacher model itself.The proposed "DriveAdapter" model combines these ideas to achieve state-of-the-art performance on autonomous driving benchmarks. So the main hypothesis is that this paradigm of decoupling perception and planning with adapters can achieve better performance compared to end-to-end approaches that train both together.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are the main contributions:- The paper proposes a new paradigm called DriveAdapter for end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paradigm, a frozen teacher model pre-trained with reinforcement learning is directly utilized for planning and decision making. The student model focuses on perception by predicting the privileged inputs required by the teacher model. - To address the imperfect perception of the student model and imperfections in the teacher model, the paper introduces adapter modules between the student and teacher. These adapters employ masked feature alignment loss and action guidance loss to align the student's features with the teacher and inject safety priors.- DriveAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on two closed-loop simulation benchmarks in CARLA. The results demonstrate the benefits of decoupling perception and planning and utilizing the driving knowledge within the teacher model.- The paper provides extensive ablation studies and analysis to validate the proposed techniques. It also explores other attempts like directly generating intermediate features of the teacher model.In summary, the key innovation is the proposed DriveAdapter paradigm and the adapter modules to enable a frozen teacher model to directly conduct planning while the student focuses on perception. This avoids issues like causal confusion in behavior cloning and allows leveraging the expertise of the teacher model.
