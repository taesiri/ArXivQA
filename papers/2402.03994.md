# [Gradient Sketches for Training Data Attribution and Studying the Loss   Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03994)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are important applications like training data attribution and analyzing the Hessian spectrum that require storing large numbers of gradient and Hessian vector product (HVP) vectors. This becomes infeasible for modern large neural networks.
- Existing approaches to "sketch" these vectors to lower dimensional representations rely on dense matrices, which are still memory bound and do not scale. 

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate more efficient sketching algorithms that have constant $O(N)$ memory cost independent of the sketch dimension. 
- Revisit design choices in prior works like Fastfood and Ailon-Chazelle transforms to understand their limitations on modern hardware accelerators. Identify key choices around implicit vs explicit sketching and choice of preconditioner matrix.
- Propose new sketching algorithms BAMI and Frikadel that remove look-up bottlenecks for better TPU performance. Also propose QK method which generalizes prior Kronecker product approaches.
- Provide theoretical analysis to show BAMI and QK satisfy guarantees for sketching arbitrary vectors. Also show Fastfood does not have such guarantees.
- Demonstrate efficiency of new algorithms on applications like training data attribution, intrinsic dimension search, and Hessian eigenvalue estimation.

Main Contributions:
- Exploration of design space for sketching algorithms leading to new methods optimized for accelerators
- A more efficient search algorithm for estimating intrinsic dimension
- First study applying sketching to eigenvalue estimation for large language models
- Findings regarding eigenvalue evolution and lack of gradient concentration for some language models, contradicting prior conjectures
- First example where intrinsic dimension for a generative task matches model dimension, depending on metric

In summary, the paper provides both theoretical and empirical contributions around developing more efficient sketching algorithms in the context of modern deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes and theoretically analyzes more efficient algorithms for sketching gradients and Hessian vector products to overcome memory bottlenecks in applications like training data attribution and analyzing the Hessian spectrum, also using sketching to speed up estimation of model intrinsic dimension and eigendecomposition during fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It explores the design space for more efficient sketching algorithms to overcome memory constraints when storing many gradients or Hessian vector products. It analyzes the limitations of previous algorithms like Ailon-Chazelle and Fastfood, and proposes new algorithms like Frikadel, BAMI, and Straight that are more suited for modern hardware accelerators.

2) It proposes a more efficient search algorithm to find the intrinsic dimension of neural network loss landscapes. This searches in a single training run that gradually grows the dimension, rather than doing multiple runs with different fixed dimensions.

3) It demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed sketching algorithms and search method in three applications - training data attribution, analyzing the Hessian spectrum during training, and computing the intrinsic dimension when fine-tuning language models. For a generative task, it shows the intrinsic dimension can depend on the metric and be close to the full model dimension.

4) It scales up eigenvalue estimation during training by using sketching to build a large Krylov subspace. It revisits some conjectures about properties of the eigenvalues and gradients during training, showing different behavior for language models compared to CNNs.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing more efficient sketching algorithms, a better search method for intrinsic dimension, and demonstrating their usefulness for scaling three important applications related to model training and interpretation.

The paper discusses using sketching and random projections of gradients and Hessian vector products to overcome memory constraints when storing a large number of such vectors. This has applications in training data attribution and studying the loss landscape. The paper connects this to prior work on the intrinsic dimension of neural networks. It proposes new sketching algorithms, analyzes their design space, and proves some theoretical guarantees. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposals in three applications: training data attribution, analyzing the Hessian spectrum during fine-tuning of language models, and more efficient search for the intrinsic dimension. Key terms like sketching, intrinsic dimension, Hessian vector products, eigenvalues, etc. feature prominently throughout.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper discusses limitations of using layer selection for training data attribution (TDA). Can you elaborate on why layer selection results in unreliable influence score estimates? What specifically causes the distortion when using gradients from only certain layers?

2) When analyzing the design space for more efficient sketching algorithms, the paper finds that explicit sketches lead to considerable performance gains over implicit sketches. Why might this be the case? What differences between the explicit and implicit approaches could explain the wall-time improvements observed? 

3) The authors propose a new intrinsic dimension search algorithm that progressively grows the dimension D during training. What is the motivation behind this approach compared to doing separate training runs with different values of D? What benefits does the progressive search strategy offer?

4) For the generative summarization task, the estimated intrinsic dimension D_int approaches the full model dimension for Rouge2 but not Rouge1. What does this suggest about how the notion of intrinsic dimension depends on the choice of evaluation metric? Why might different metrics give vastly different estimates of D_int?

5) The paper finds different behaviors in the evolution of negative Hessian eigenvalues during fine-tuning of language models. For instance, the ratio RNEG decreases steadily for BART but not for Roberta. What implications does this have for proposals to add regularization to make the Hessian positive definite?

6) Despite the emergence of Hessian outlier eigenvalues in fine-tuning experiments, the gradient is not well-aligned with the outlier eigenvectors. The paper states this has negative implications for algorithms that aim to leverage information about outlier eigenvectors. Elaborate on what those implications are.  

7) Compare and contrast the theoretical guarantees provided for the Fastfood and BAMI sketching algorithms. What causes Fastfood to fail on certain adversarial inputs? How does BAMI overcome limitations of Fastfood?

8) The paper introduces FRIKADEL and Straight sketching algorithms. How do these approaches differ in their use of the preconditioner compared to Ailon-Chazelle and Fastfood transforms? What motivated exploring different preconditioner strategies?

9) When evaluating sketching algorithms, what factors contribute to better wall-time performance on TPUs versus GPUs? Why does removing look-up operations have a bigger impact on TPUs? 

10) For the proposed straight sketching algorithm, explain why using a more general Kronecker product decomposition strategy could be more memory efficient than approaches in prior work. What flexibility does it offer in trading off between different parameters?
