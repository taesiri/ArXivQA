# [Neural Automated Writing Evaluation with Corrective Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Providing feedback on essay submissions is very time consuming for language instructors and understanding feedback can be difficult for language learners. Automated writing evaluation (AWE) and grammatical error correction (GEC) tools could help address this by providing automated scoring and corrective feedback.  
- However, AWE and GEC tools have largely been developed separately. Integrating them could better support the language learning process by enabling simulated essay writing tests with both holistic scoring and grammar corrections.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an integrated AWE and GEC system to bridge this gap. Students can submit essays and receive a holistic score, rubric-based trait scores, and inline grammar corrections all together. 
- For AWE, they leverage the ASAP dataset and use RoBERTa for regression to predict scores. For GEC, they build neural sequence-to-sequence models using BERT and BART trained on standard GEC datasets.
- The system is designed to be compatible with multilingual data and universal rubrics. Extensions for providing feedback in Chinese and Korean are discussed.

Main Contributions:
- First demonstration of an integrated neural AWE and GEC system to provide holistic and rubric-based scoring along with grammar corrections.
- Discusses extensions to multilingual scoring and feedback.
- Proposes additional functionality to enable instructors to customize automated feedback before delivery to students.
- Plans experiments on student and teacher perceptions of automated vs human feedback.
- Overall, the system aims to reduce burden on instructors, provide more efficient practices for students, and transform traditional language instruction.
