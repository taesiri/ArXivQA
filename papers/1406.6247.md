# [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Applying convolutional neural networks to large images is computationally expensive as the amount of computation scales linearly with the number of pixels. 
- Humans focus attention selectively on parts of a visual scene over time to build an internal representation while reducing computation.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a recurrent neural network based model that attends to different locations in images/videos over time.
- The model processes inputs sequentially, attending to different locations one at a time.
- It uses the internal state of the network to decide where to look next and what action to take.

Main Contributions:
- Both number of parameters and computation amount can be controlled independently of input image size.
- Has built-in translation invariance like CNNs, but can better deal with clutter by focusing on relevant regions.
- Trainable end-to-end using policy gradient to directly optimize performance measure over sequence of decisions.
- Evaluate on image classification tasks and a dynamic visual control task.
- Significantly outperforms CNNs on cluttered images and learns to track objects without explicit supervision.
- Flexible approach allowing extensions like terminating glimpses early and controlling scale.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel recurrent visual attention model as an alternative to convolutional networks that processes images sequentially based on an attention mechanism. It has appealing properties like handling clutter and scaling to large images. The model is demonstrated to learn effective task-specific attention control policies on both static and dynamic vision tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel recurrent neural network model for visual attention that processes images sequentially by selecting and focusing on parts of the image, integrating information over time, and learning task-specific policies to maximize performance on image classification and control problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel recurrent neural network model for visual attention that can selectively focus computational resources on parts of an image or video. Key aspects of this contribution include:

1) The model processes inputs sequentially, attending to different locations in the image one at a time. This allows computation to be focused only on relevant regions rather than processing the entire image, saving computational resources.

2) The model uses reinforcement learning to learn task-specific policies for where to look next and what actions to take. This allows the model to learn to attend intelligently based on the demands of the task.

3) The same general architecture can be applied to both static image tasks like classification as well as dynamic environments like game playing. Experiments show the model can learn effective attention policies in both settings.

4) The amount of computation scales independently with the input image size, unlike convolutional neural networks where computation scales linearly. This could make the model advantageous for large images.

5) Experiments suggest the model may be better at dealing with clutter than convolutional networks, since it can learn to ignore irrelevant parts of the image simply by not looking at them.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a unified neural attention model that can learn flexible task-specific attention policies to focus computational resources, with properties that could provide advantages over existing feedforward convolutional networks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper formulates visual attention as a reinforcement learning problem. Can you explain in detail how the Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation allows training the model using policy gradient methods? What are the challenges in using policy gradients for this model?

2. The glimpse sensor extracts a retina-like representation around the attended location. What are the advantages of using a multi-resolution foveated glimpse instead of attending to fixed size patches? How is translation invariance achieved through the glimpses?

3. The location network uses a 2-component Gaussian policy for selecting glimpse locations. What are the benefits of a stochastic location policy over a deterministic one? How sensitive is the model performance to the variance of this policy? 

4. The core recurrent network processes the glimpse features and previous internal state to produce the new state. Why is using RNN cores like LSTM useful for dynamic environments over feedforward networks? What challenges arise in training RNNs with reinforcement learning objectives?

5. The paper shows significant gains over convolutional networks on cluttered datasets. What properties of the attention model make it robust to clutter? Can you suggest methods to make convolutional networks more robust to clutter?

6. The model uses supervision from the classification loss to train the action network. How does using a hybrid loss help in learning faster over pure reinforcement learning? What are the limitations of doing this?

7. The location network is always trained using policy gradients. Why not use supervised learning to directly predict optimal glimpse locations? What makes predicting locations difficult to supervise?

8. How does the amount of computation performed by this model scale with the input image size compared to convolutional networks? Can you suggest methods to reduce the computational requirements of this model?

9. The model parameters are sensitive to the reward scaling. What techniques can make the training more stable wrt hyperparameter choices? How does credit assignment over long sequences remain a challenge?

10. The attention model seems highly suited for selecting regions in videos and scaling robustly. What are the major challenges in scaling this model to complex video tasks? How can curriculum learning help?
