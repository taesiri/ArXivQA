# [Unified Diffusion-Based Rigid and Non-Rigid Editing with Text and Image   Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-to-image editing methods tend to excel either at rigid editing (preserving structure while changing appearance) or non-rigid editing (changing structure while preserving appearance), but struggle to combine both effectively in a single framework. This results in outputs that may not fully align with the text prompts. In addition, integrating reference images as additional control is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
The authors present a versatile image editing framework that performs both rigid and non-rigid editing guided by text prompts or reference images. The key ideas are:

1) Dual-path injection scheme: The source image and text/reference image correspond to distinct generation processes which inject their respective information into the editing process. This enhances text-image alignment and allows injecting information from references. 

2) Unified self-attention mechanism: Consolidates appearance and structural information from different generation processes based on semantic correspondences. This transfers and merges information precisely.

3) Latent fusion techniques: Adjusts intermediate latent distributions to mitigate issues like color disparities and unwanted background changes.

Main Contributions:
1) A dual-path injection scheme facilitating both rigid and non-rigid editing with text/image guidance.
2) A unified self-attention mechanism and latent fusion techniques to integrate appearance and structural information from multiple processes.
3) Comprehensive experiments demonstrating competitive or superior performance in text-based editing and appearance transfer tasks encompassing both rigid and non-rigid settings.

In summary, the paper introduces effective techniques for versatile image editing through the fusion of information from text, reference images and source image generation processes to achieve precise and aligned rigid as well as non-rigid manipulation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a versatile image editing framework capable of performing both rigid and non-rigid edits guided by text prompts or reference images through innovations like a dual-path injection scheme, a unified self-attention mechanism, and latent fusion techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a versatile image editing framework that is capable of performing both rigid and non-rigid edits, guided by either textual prompts or reference images. 

Specifically, the key innovations presented that enable this capability are:

1) A dual-path injection scheme that facilitates injecting appearance and structural information from distinct generation processes into the editing process. This enhances alignment with text prompts and allows guidance from reference images.

2) A unified self-attention mechanism that integrates appearance and structural information from multiple generation processes based on semantic correspondences. This allows precise fusion of information.

3) Latent fusion techniques such as AdaIN and blended diffusion that adjust the distribution of intermediate latents to alleviate issues like color disparities.

Through these proposed components, the method achieves a flexible framework for image editing that handles both rigid and non-rigid scenarios guided by text or images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and competent performance.

In summary, the main contribution is designing an innovative and versatile image editing framework uniquely capable of both rigid and non-rigid edits under text or image guidance.
