# [Masked Jigsaw Puzzle: A Versatile Position Embedding for Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12551)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How do position embeddings (PEs) affect the accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of vision transformers (ViTs)?

The key points are:

- PEs are an important component in ViTs but their impacts have not been thoroughly studied. 

- The authors find PEs can learn 2D spatial relationships between image patches, which helps accuracy but poses privacy risks.

- Naively shuffling patches disrupts spatial relations and protects privacy, but harms accuracy.

- The proposed Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) method balances accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of ViTs.

- MJP shuffles some patches, "masks" their PEs, and strengthens spatial relations for unshuffled patches.

- Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet, robustness on corrupted data, and privacy against gradient attacks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that there exists a tradeoff between accuracy, privacy, and consistency related to PEs, and the paper aims to find a solution (MJP) that balances these factors for ViTs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. They visually demonstrate that position embeddings (PEs) in vision transformers (ViTs) can explicitly learn the 2D spatial relationship of input image patches. 

2. They identify an issue that PEs may weaken the position-insensitive property of ViTs.

3. They propose a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method to find a balance between accuracy, privacy, and consistency:

- MJP shuffles selected patches and uses an "unknown" PE for them. 

- It strengthens the spatial relation of non-shuffled patches with a dense absolute localization regressor.

4. Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet-1K and robustness on ImageNet-C/-A/O. 

5. MJP also improves privacy preservation under gradient attacks.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposed MJP method, which balances accuracy, privacy, and consistency for ViTs by strategically shuffling patches and strengthening spatial relations. The experiments demonstrate improvements in various metrics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle position embedding method that improves privacy and prediction consistency for Vision Transformers by shuffling some patches and masking their position embeddings while strengthening the spatial relation of other patches.
