# [Masked Jigsaw Puzzle: A Versatile Position Embedding for Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12551)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How do position embeddings (PEs) affect the accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of vision transformers (ViTs)?

The key points are:

- PEs are an important component in ViTs but their impacts have not been thoroughly studied. 

- The authors find PEs can learn 2D spatial relationships between image patches, which helps accuracy but poses privacy risks.

- Naively shuffling patches disrupts spatial relations and protects privacy, but harms accuracy.

- The proposed Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) method balances accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of ViTs.

- MJP shuffles some patches, "masks" their PEs, and strengthens spatial relations for unshuffled patches.

- Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet, robustness on corrupted data, and privacy against gradient attacks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that there exists a tradeoff between accuracy, privacy, and consistency related to PEs, and the paper aims to find a solution (MJP) that balances these factors for ViTs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. They visually demonstrate that position embeddings (PEs) in vision transformers (ViTs) can explicitly learn the 2D spatial relationship of input image patches. 

2. They identify an issue that PEs may weaken the position-insensitive property of ViTs.

3. They propose a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method to find a balance between accuracy, privacy, and consistency:

- MJP shuffles selected patches and uses an "unknown" PE for them. 

- It strengthens the spatial relation of non-shuffled patches with a dense absolute localization regressor.

4. Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet-1K and robustness on ImageNet-C/-A/O. 

5. MJP also improves privacy preservation under gradient attacks.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposed MJP method, which balances accuracy, privacy, and consistency for ViTs by strategically shuffling patches and strengthening spatial relations. The experiments demonstrate improvements in various metrics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle position embedding method that improves privacy and prediction consistency for Vision Transformers by shuffling some patches and masking their position embeddings while strengthening the spatial relation of other patches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a comparison to related research in the field of vision transformers and position embeddings:

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by studying the effects of position embeddings (PEs) in vision transformers (ViTs), which has been relatively under-explored compared to other aspects like attention mechanisms. 

The key findings are:

- PEs can explicitly encode spatial relationships between image patches, which improves accuracy but harms privacy and consistency against patch shuffling. This visualization of what PEs learn is a new analysis.

- Naively shuffling patches improves consistency but harms accuracy. The paper proposes a balanced solution via masked jigsaw puzzle PEs.

- The proposed method improves accuracy on ImageNet and robustness on ImageNet-C/-A/O. This is a valuable empirical demonstration.

Related works have mainly focused on designing objectives or attention variants for ViTs. For example:

- PVT [Wang et al. 2021] proposed pyramid vision transformers with spatial-reduction attention.

- Swin Transformers [Liu et al. 2021] designed shifted windows for hierarchical attention. 

These improve ViT accuracy but do not study PEs or the accuracy vs privacy/consistency trade-off.

For PEs, some works like PETR [Liu et al. 2022] and Conditional Positional Encodings [Chu et al. 2021] also aim to improve modeling of spatial relationships. However, they use more complex relative position modeling while this paper takes a different approach via jigsaw puzzle PEs. 

Overall, this paper provides valuable new analysis and insights on the role of PEs in ViTs, complementing prior work on attention mechanisms. The proposed method is simple yet effective in balancing accuracy, privacy and consistency.
