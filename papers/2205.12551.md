# [Masked Jigsaw Puzzle: A Versatile Position Embedding for Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12551)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How do position embeddings (PEs) affect the accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of vision transformers (ViTs)?

The key points are:

- PEs are an important component in ViTs but their impacts have not been thoroughly studied. 

- The authors find PEs can learn 2D spatial relationships between image patches, which helps accuracy but poses privacy risks.

- Naively shuffling patches disrupts spatial relations and protects privacy, but harms accuracy.

- The proposed Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) method balances accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of ViTs.

- MJP shuffles some patches, "masks" their PEs, and strengthens spatial relations for unshuffled patches.

- Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet, robustness on corrupted data, and privacy against gradient attacks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that there exists a tradeoff between accuracy, privacy, and consistency related to PEs, and the paper aims to find a solution (MJP) that balances these factors for ViTs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. They visually demonstrate that position embeddings (PEs) in vision transformers (ViTs) can explicitly learn the 2D spatial relationship of input image patches. 

2. They identify an issue that PEs may weaken the position-insensitive property of ViTs.

3. They propose a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method to find a balance between accuracy, privacy, and consistency:

- MJP shuffles selected patches and uses an "unknown" PE for them. 

- It strengthens the spatial relation of non-shuffled patches with a dense absolute localization regressor.

4. Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet-1K and robustness on ImageNet-C/-A/O. 

5. MJP also improves privacy preservation under gradient attacks.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposed MJP method, which balances accuracy, privacy, and consistency for ViTs by strategically shuffling patches and strengthening spatial relations. The experiments demonstrate improvements in various metrics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle position embedding method that improves privacy and prediction consistency for Vision Transformers by shuffling some patches and masking their position embeddings while strengthening the spatial relation of other patches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a comparison to related research in the field of vision transformers and position embeddings:

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by studying the effects of position embeddings (PEs) in vision transformers (ViTs), which has been relatively under-explored compared to other aspects like attention mechanisms. 

The key findings are:

- PEs can explicitly encode spatial relationships between image patches, which improves accuracy but harms privacy and consistency against patch shuffling. This visualization of what PEs learn is a new analysis.

- Naively shuffling patches improves consistency but harms accuracy. The paper proposes a balanced solution via masked jigsaw puzzle PEs.

- The proposed method improves accuracy on ImageNet and robustness on ImageNet-C/-A/O. This is a valuable empirical demonstration.

Related works have mainly focused on designing objectives or attention variants for ViTs. For example:

- PVT [Wang et al. 2021] proposed pyramid vision transformers with spatial-reduction attention.

- Swin Transformers [Liu et al. 2021] designed shifted windows for hierarchical attention. 

These improve ViT accuracy but do not study PEs or the accuracy vs privacy/consistency trade-off.

For PEs, some works like PETR [Liu et al. 2022] and Conditional Positional Encodings [Chu et al. 2021] also aim to improve modeling of spatial relationships. However, they use more complex relative position modeling while this paper takes a different approach via jigsaw puzzle PEs. 

Overall, this paper provides valuable new analysis and insights on the role of PEs in ViTs, complementing prior work on attention mechanisms. The proposed method is simple yet effective in balancing accuracy, privacy and consistency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different variants and formulations of the proposed Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method. The authors mention this could include trying different shuffle algorithms, masking strategies, ways to strengthen the spatial prior, etc.

- Applying the MJP concept to other vision Transformer architectures besides the ones tested in the paper. The authors show results on DeiT and Swin Transformers but suggest exploring MJP with other popular ViT models.

- Extending MJP to other vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The authors note MJP may have benefits for privacy and robustness in these areas too.

- Combining MJP with other useful techniques like distillation or semi-supervised learning. The authors suggest MJP could have complementary effects.

- Developing specialized adversarial attacks targeted at models using MJP, to better understand its vulnerabilities.

- Exploring the use of MJP in federated learning settings more extensively, since the authors show initial promise for improving privacy.

- Theoretically analyzing the effects of MJP on the learned representations of Vision Transformers in more depth.

Overall, the authors propose MJP as a promising way to enhance privacy and consistency of Vision Transformers, while maintaining accuracy. They suggest numerous avenues to build on top of it in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) to improve privacy preservation and prediction consistency against image patch shuffling while maintaining accuracy. The method involves: 1) using block-wise masking to randomly select some patches, 2) shuffling the selected patches via a jigsaw puzzle algorithm, 3) replacing the position embeddings (PEs) of shuffled patches with a shared 'unknown' embedding, and 4) adding a dense absolute localization (DAL) regressor on the unshuffled PEs to strengthen their spatial relationships. Experiments show PEs capture spatial relationships but harm privacy and consistency. Naively shuffling patches improves consistency but reduces accuracy. MJP balances these trade-offs, boosting accuracy on ImageNet while significantly improving robustness, privacy preservation against gradient attacks, and consistency compared to baselines like DeiT and Swin Transformers. The proposed techniques provide insights on the effects of PEs and present a simple yet effective approach to enhance ViTs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) to improve privacy preservation while maintaining accuracy. The key ideas are:

1) The paper first visually demonstrates that standard position embeddings (PEs) in ViTs explicitly encode 2D spatial relationships between image patches, improving accuracy but leading to privacy risks. As a solution, the paper proposes to shuffle a portion of patches via a block-wise jigsaw puzzle algorithm, replacing their PEs with a shared "unknown" embedding. This breaks the spatial relationship and misleads gradient attacks.

2) To maintain accuracy, the paper keeps PEs for unshuffled patches but strengthens their spatial relationship via a self-supervised dense absolute localization (DAL) regressor. This accelerates training. The full MJP method balances accuracy, privacy, and consistency. Experiments on ImageNet datasets show MJP boosts accuracy, robustness and privacy over baselines. The consistent predictions for original/shuffled images and protection against gradient attacks demonstrate the benefits.

In summary, the key contribution is the MJP position embedding method that shuffles patch order to enhance privacy while using DAL regression on remaining patches to preserve accuracy and training efficiency for ViTs. The experiments demonstrate the improvements on accuracy, robustness and privacy preservation.
