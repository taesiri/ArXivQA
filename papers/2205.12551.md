# [Masked Jigsaw Puzzle: A Versatile Position Embedding for Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12551)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How do position embeddings (PEs) affect the accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of vision transformers (ViTs)?

The key points are:

- PEs are an important component in ViTs but their impacts have not been thoroughly studied. 

- The authors find PEs can learn 2D spatial relationships between image patches, which helps accuracy but poses privacy risks.

- Naively shuffling patches disrupts spatial relations and protects privacy, but harms accuracy.

- The proposed Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) method balances accuracy, privacy, and prediction consistency of ViTs.

- MJP shuffles some patches, "masks" their PEs, and strengthens spatial relations for unshuffled patches.

- Experiments show MJP boosts accuracy on ImageNet, robustness on corrupted data, and privacy against gradient attacks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that there exists a tradeoff between accuracy, privacy, and consistency related to PEs, and the paper aims to find a solution (MJP) that balances these factors for ViTs.
