# [Multitask Learning in Minimally Invasive Surgical Vision: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08256)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive review of multitask learning (MTL) techniques and their applications in minimally invasive surgeries (MIS). MTL allows multiple related tasks to be learned jointly, sharing representations and regularization benefits. 

The paper first provides background on popular MTL concepts and methods used in computer vision, like hard and soft parameter sharing, optimization strategies, auxiliary tasks, and data-efficient approaches. It then extensively reviews MTL literature in MIS across six key areas:

1) MTL for perceptual tasks like segmentation, depth estimation, pose estimation. Key works learn combinations of these inter-related tasks jointly using shared encoders and task-specific decoders. Some use auxiliary tasks like contour prediction to regularize primary tasks.  

2) MTL for tracking and control tasks like surgical tool pose estimation and automatic camera control/scanpath prediction. Works predict future motions and salient regions from current inputs by incorporating temporal models like LSTMs.

3) MTL for surgical workflow analysis spanning action recognition, phase recognition, etc. Many leverage tool detection as an auxiliary task, while recent works focus more on fine-grained action triplets and multi-granularity understanding.

4) MTL for surgical skill assessment, using auxiliary tasks like gesture recognition along with main skill classification/regression objectives.

5) MTL for surgical report generation, using combinations of scene graph prediction and image captioning to produce structured summaries.

6) Large models capable of solving multiple surgical understanding tasks with a common architecture, using methods like prompt programming.

The paper also summarizes key public datasets for MTL research in MIS, comprising various multi-task label combinations. Finally, it provides insights into prevailing trends and limitations, while identifying promising areas for future exploration like standardized comparisons of MTL techniques, investigating inter-task relationships, and developing more generalized multi-task models.
