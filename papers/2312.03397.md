# [Generalized Contrastive Divergence: Joint Training of Energy-Based Model   and Diffusion Model through Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03397)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Divergence (GCD), a novel training objective for jointly optimizing an energy-based model (EBM) and a parametric sampler such as a diffusion model. GCD generalizes the well-known Contrastive Divergence algorithm by replacing the MCMC sampler with a parametric sampler that is trained adversarially against the EBM. This enables stable training of the EBM without relying on expensive MCMC sampling. An interesting connection is made to inverse reinforcement learning, where the EBM learns a reward signal from data demonstrations and the sampler acts as a policy optimizing that reward. Preliminary experiments on a 2D dataset demonstrate that GCD training can effectively recover the data distribution while improving sample quality, especially when the sampler uses only a small number of steps. The learned EBM can also provide useful likelihood estimates. Overall, GCD opens up opportunities to improve generative modeling using ideas from reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Divergence (GCD), a novel objective function for jointly training an energy-based model and a diffusion model through a minimax formulation, showing connections to integral probability metric minimization and inverse reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing Generalized Contrastive Divergence (GCD), a novel method for jointly training an energy-based model (EBM) and a parametric sampler like a diffusion model. The key benefits are:

- Enables EBM training without needing MCMC sampling, which can be computationally expensive and unstable. 

- Can be used to fine-tune a diffusion model with fewer timesteps to improve sample quality.

2. Showing GCD learning has connections to integral probability metric (IPM) minimization and maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). This opens opportunities to leverage ideas from these fields to advance generative modeling.

3. Presenting preliminary experimental results on a 2D synthetic dataset showing GCD can accurately estimate densities, improve diffusion model sample quality, and outperform conventional IPM training.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the GCD training framework for jointly optimizing EBMs and samplers, along with showing promising initial results and connections to other problems like IPM minimization and IRL.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Generalized Contrastive Divergence (GCD): The proposed novel objective function for jointly training an energy-based model (EBM) and a trainable sampler like a diffusion model. Generalizes contrastive divergence algorithm.

- Energy-based model (EBM): A generative model that represents a probability distribution using an energy function. Trained via GCD without needing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

- Diffusion model: A generative model that can be used as the trainable sampler in GCD, such as DDPM. Fine-tuned via GCD to improve sample quality.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models like DDPM generate high-quality samples but have some limitations: they don't directly minimize divergence from data distribution, sampling is slow requiring many steps, and marginal likelihood can't be directly computed.

- Energy-based models (EBMs) allow direct likelihood computation but training requires expensive MCMC sampling which is unstable. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Divergence (GCD) for jointly training an EBM and a diffusion sampler to overcome the limitations. 

- GCD generalizes contrastive divergence by replacing MCMC sampler with a trainable diffusion sampler.

- GCD formulates joint training as a minimax game which reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution.

Key Contributions:
- GCD enables EBM training without MCMC sampling.
- Join training under GCD improves sample quality of diffusion samplers, especially when number of steps is small.
- Learned EBM can directly compute marginal likelihood of data.

- GCD learning is equivalent to minimization of integral probability metric regularized by entropy of diffusion sampler. The EBM learns the critic.

- An analogy is made between GCD learning and inverse reinforcement learning. The diffusion sampler is viewed as a policy, EBM provides reward signal.

- Experiments on 2D densities validate GCD can recover multi-modal densities. Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion sampler under GCD further improves sample quality.

In summary, the key idea is to jointly train an EBM and diffusion model under GCD objective that reaches equilibrium at data distribution. This synergistically benefits both models - avoiding expensive MCMC for EBM and improving sample quality for diffusion models.
