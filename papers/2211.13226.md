# [ClimateNeRF: Extreme Weather Synthesis in Neural Radiance Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13226)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

"What constitutes a good simulatable NeRF representation?"

The authors aim to repurpose neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for realistic computer graphics simulation of weather effects like flooding, snow, and smog. However, they find that directly integrating existing NeRF models with physical simulations yields unsatisfactory results due to inaccuracies in geometry and incomplete modeling of illumination. 

To address this challenge, the paper investigates techniques to improve NeRF models to make them more suitable for downstream simulation tasks. Specifically, the authors identify three key requirements for a "good simulatable NeRF representation":

1) Accuracy and completeness of geometry, to allow accurate physical interactions with simulated elements like water and snow. 

2) Semantic awareness, to enable interactions that reflect the scene's characteristics.

3) Coherence and completeness of the illumination field, to realistically light the simulated physical entities.

The paper explores methods to enhance NeRF models to meet these criteria, such as predicting surface normals and semantics, using distortion losses, and disentangling geometry and appearance. The resulting "ClimateNeRF" model is then demonstrated to enable high-quality simulation and rendering of weather effects in a physically realistic and controllable manner.

In summary, the central research question is how to repurpose NeRF for realistic graphics simulation, which requires improving NeRF geometry, semantics, and illumination modeling. The paper focuses on identifying the key criteria for a "good simulatable NeRF" and developing a novel NeRF variant to meet those requirements.
