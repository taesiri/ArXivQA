# [Gaussian Frosting: Editable Complex Radiance Fields with Real-Time   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing neural rendering methods like NeRFs can generate high-quality novel views of a scene, but they are slow and do not provide an editable scene representation. Recent works on Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable very efficient rendering, but the unstructured set of Gaussians is hard to edit or animate. Surface-based methods like SuGaR extract a mesh for editing but lose quality when rendering complex materials like fur or hair. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Gaussian Frosting, a novel hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh with an adaptive layer of Gaussians around it. The key ideas are:

1) Extract a base mesh from 3DGS using SuGaR for editability. Improve SuGaR's surface reconstruction to handle complex scenes better.  

2) Build a Gaussian "Frosting" layer around this mesh, with thickness adapted locally to the complexity and fuzziness of scene materials. Fuzzy materials like fur get a thicker frosting.

3) Parameterize Gaussians using barycentric coords to constrain them inside this layer and facilitate editing the base mesh.

4) Refine frosting by optimizing the Gaussians to match images, enforcing them to stay in layer.

5) Animate by deforming base mesh, frosting Gaussians automatically adjust positions and orientations.

Main Contributions:

- Frosting representation that combines a mesh for editing with a layer of Gaussians for high-quality rendering of materials like fur and hair. Layer has variable adaptive thickness.

- Method to build Frosting from RGB images, improving on 3DGS and SuGaR. Can render and edit complex effects like hair and grass in real-time.

- Barycentric parameterization of Gaussians to constrain them inside layer and automatically adjust parameters when animation or editing the mesh.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results for editable representations. Frosting matches or exceeds the quality of unconstrained 3DGS.

- Will release optimization code and a web viewer to demonstrate real-time rendering and editing capabilities.
