# [Can Large Language Models Automatically Score Proficiency of Written   Essays?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06149)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automated essay scoring (AES) aims to automatically evaluate the quality of written essays to save time for teachers and provide feedback to students.
- Despite decades of research, there is still room for improvement in AES systems. 
- Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have shown impressive natural language abilities, but their potential for AES is unknown.

Methodology:
- The authors evaluate ChatGPT and Llama on the ASAP dataset for holistic and trait-based AES.
- They design 4 prompts with increasing elaborations to study the impact of prompt engineering. 
- They compare performance to state-of-the-art models and analyze consistency across prompts.

Key Findings:  
- Prompt engineering significantly impacts performance, but the best prompt depends on the LLM and task.
- ChatGPT demonstrates higher consistency than Llama.  
- Both LLMs lag behind state-of-the-art in terms of scoring accuracy.
- However, LLMs provide meaningful feedback to potentially improve essay quality.

Main Contributions:
- First study to comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT and Llama for automated essay scoring.
- Analysis of impact of prompt engineering strategies. 
- Comparison of scoring accuracy against state-of-the-art models.
- Demonstration of LLMs' potential for generating helpful writing feedback.

The study reveals strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for this task. While scoring accuracy lags behind other models, their linguistic knowledge could be beneficial for providing writing feedback to students.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the performance of two large language models, ChatGPT and Llama, on the task of automatically scoring essays from the ASAP dataset, finding that while their performance lags behind state-of-the-art models, prompt engineering can enhance their scoring ability and they show promise in providing meaningful feedback to improve essay quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are four-fold:

1. The authors evaluate the predictive performance of two large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Llama 2, for automated essay scoring (AES) at both the holistic and trait-based levels. They compare the performance against state-of-the-art models. 

2. The authors show the impact of prompt engineering on ChatGPT's and Llama's performance for AES by designing four different prompts with incremental task elaboration.  

3. The authors study the consistency of ChatGPT's and Llama's performance in AES across different prompts.

4. The authors make all responses of the LLMs (including their generated feedback) publicly available to enable further analysis and research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

- Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) 
- ChatGPT
- Llama
- Prompt engineering
- Performance consistency
- State-of-the-art models
- Feedback generation
- Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)

The paper examines using ChatGPT and Llama, two large language models, for automated essay scoring. It studies the effect of different prompt designs on their performance, evaluates their scoring consistency across prompts, and compares their performance to state-of-the-art models. The paper also analyzes the feedback these models can provide to improve essay quality. The performance is quantified using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa metric. So these would be some of the key terms associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper examines the performance of ChatGPT and Llama on the task of automated essay scoring (AES). How do the architectures and training procedures of these two models compare? What unique capabilities might each model have that could be useful for evaluating essays?

2. The authors designed four different prompt variants to provide incremental task elaboration to the models. Can you summarize the key differences between these prompts? What was the rationale behind structuring them this way? 

3. Prompt engineering seemed to have a significant effect on the models' performance. For ChatGPT, which prompt worked best for each essay type (persuasive, narrative, source-dependent) and why might that be the case?

4. The paper observed inconsistent performance from Llama across different prompts for the same task. What might explain this sensitivity to prompt design compared to ChatGPT? How might the pre-training or architecture lead to this discrepancy?

5. While the models lagged behind state-of-the-art methods in score prediction itself, the paper suggests potential for using LLMs to provide meaningful feedback to students. What examples support this possibility? How could this feedback be evaluated more systematically?  

6. The study utilizes several performance measures including QWK. What are the advantages of QWK over other metrics for evaluating agreement with human raters? What are its limitations?

7. What data preprocessing or constraints were imposed in designing the prompts? How might these decisions impact the models' performance or training efficiency? 

8. For practical applications, what factors should be considered in selecting the right prompt structure for a given model and task? What type of error analysis could shed more light on this?

9. How well did the models capture properties of essay quality as defined in the scoring rubrics? Were there noticeable gaps for certain dimensions of writing proficiency?

10. The authors plan to extend this work by analyzing generated feedback, testing additional models, and experimenting on other datasets. What findings or limitations from the current study should guide these future directions?
