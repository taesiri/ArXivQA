# [Nesting Particle Filters for Experimental Design in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) for sequential non-exchangeable experiments, such as those arising in dynamical systems. BED involves choosing experimental designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about unknown parameters of interest. However, computing the EIG involves intractable integrals over the marginal likelihood and posteriors. This makes sequential BED challenging, especially for real-time systems with streaming data.

Recent approaches like deep adaptive design (DAD) and implicit DAD (iDAD) address this by learning an amortized policy to predict designs, eliminating the per-experiment optimization. However, they rely on a biased EIG estimator that requires many samples for reasonable accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
This paper frames sequential BED as a risk-sensitive control problem, establishing a duality with inference in an equivalent non-Markovian nonlinear non-Gaussian state space model. 

Leveraging this insight, the paper develops a nested particle filtering algorithm called Inside-Out SMC2 to draw samples from the dual model. This allows jointly estimating the EIG and optimal designs while keeping the marginal model dynamics marginalized. 

The method uses iterated batch importance sampling (IBIS) within a bootstrap particle filter to marginalize the unknown parameters. The resulting samples approximate the distribution of optimal trajectories.

This algorithm is embedded into a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method to maximize the dual model's likelihood - corresponding to the risk-sensitive EIG objective. This enables gradient-based optimization of an amortized neural policy for predicting designs.

Main Contributions:

- Establishing the connection between sequential BED and inference in an equivalent dynamical model

- The Inside-Out SMC2 algorithm for sampling from this model with marginalized dynamics  

- Using Inside-Out SMC2 to jointly estimate EIG and optimize designs

- Embedding Inside-Out SMC2 into a particle MCMC framework to amortize policy learning

- Empirical demonstration of faster convergence and better optimization performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines

The method solves key limitations of previous amortized BED techniques and offers an inference-driven perspective for sequential experimental design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel nested sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian experimental design that formulates it as a risk-sensitive control problem and performs policy optimization via an inference perspective, targeting non-exchangeable dynamical systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to Bayesian experimental design (BED) for non-exchangeable data that formulates it as risk-sensitive policy optimization. Specifically:

- They develop the Inside-Out SMC^2 algorithm that uses a nested sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) estimator of the expected information gain and embeds it into a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) framework to perform gradient-based policy optimization. This allows amortizing the cost of BED by learning a design policy.

- This approach is in contrast to recent methods like deep adaptive design (DAD) and implicit DAD (iDAD) that rely on biased estimators of the expected information gain to amortize costs. The proposed method does not suffer from this drawback.

- The Inside-Out SMC^2 algorithm is applied to dynamical systems with non-exchangeable data. Numerical experiments on stochastic pendulum and cartpole systems demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over existing methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel nested SMC approach to sequential BED that can amortize costs by policy optimization while avoiding biases, and its application to dynamical systems with non-exchangeable data.
