# [Crowdsourcing Task Traces for Service Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- End-user developers face challenges in scripting personalized service robot tasks for unrestricted environments due to complexity, social nuances, and lack of expertise. 
- Existing tools lack built-in task models to transfer task knowledge to end users.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a lightweight web interface to crowdsource step-by-step instructions (traces) for common household tasks.  
- Deploy interface on Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect a dataset of 207 traces across 18 task categories.
- Envision using collected traces to create task models that can be integrated into end-user development tools.
- Task models can suggest personalizations to end users' task specifications based on traces.

Key Contributions:
- Designed a scalable interface for efficiently collecting decontextualized, personalized task traces.
- Crowdsourced preliminary dataset of 207 traces across 18 common household task categories.
- Proposed vision for using collected traces as task models to transfer knowledge and assist end users scripting robot tasks.
- Demonstrated utility of interface via deployment on MTurk and positive user feedback.
- Identified limitations of current dataset size and interface automation as areas for future work.

In summary, the paper presents an interface to crowdsource personalized task traces, demonstrates collection of preliminary dataset, and proposes a vision for using traces as task models in end-user development tools for transferring knowledge and assisting with robot task scripting. Key future work involves expanding the dataset and further automating the interface.
