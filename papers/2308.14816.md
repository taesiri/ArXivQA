# [CLNeRF: Continual Learning Meets NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14816)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we design an effective continual learning system for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) that can efficiently adapt to new scene data over time without catastrophic forgetting or requiring large amounts of storage of past data?

The key points are:

- NeRFs are useful for novel view synthesis but assume all training data is available upfront. In many real applications, new data arrives sequentially over time.

- Naively retraining NeRFs on new data leads to catastrophic forgetting of past data. Storing all past data is expensive. 

- This paper proposes CLNeRF, a continual learning system for NeRFs that combines generative replay with advanced NeRF architectures like NGP.

- CLNeRF allows efficient adaptation to new data over time without forgetting past data, while requiring minimal storage of historical images.

- Experiments show CLNeRF performs on par with models trained on all data jointly, outperforming other continual learning techniques.

So in summary, the main research contribution is an effective and low-storage continual learning system to allow NeRFs to be adapted efficiently as new data arrives over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new dataset called World Across Time (WAT) for benchmarking continual learning methods for neural radiance fields (NeRF). WAT contains scenes with natural appearance and geometry changes over time, providing a more realistic setup compared to existing NeRF datasets where scenes are static. 

2. It proposes a continual learning system called CLNeRF that can efficiently adapt a single NeRF model as new images of a changing scene arrive over time. CLNeRF combines generative replay and the Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) architecture to enable fast model updates and prevent catastrophic forgetting without storing historical images.

3. It introduces trainable appearance and geometry embeddings into NGP so a single compact model can handle complex scene changes over time. 

4. It provides an extensive experimental evaluation demonstrating CLNeRF's superiority over other continual learning baselines on standard datasets and the proposed WAT dataset. CLNeRF performs on par with a model trained on all data at once while requiring minimal storage and memory overhead to incorporate new data continually.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective continual learning system CLNeRF tailored for NeRF that can efficiently adapt to changing scenes over time while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The proposed dataset WAT enables more realistic benchmarking.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my analysis, here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- Dataset: The paper introduces a new dataset called World Across Time (WAT) for studying continual learning in neural radiance fields (NeRF). This dataset contains natural indoor and outdoor scenes with appearance and geometry changes over time. Other existing NeRF datasets focus primarily on static scenes or only appearane changes. The natural temporal ordering and geometry changes in WAT make it more practical and challenging for benchmarking continual NeRF methods.

- Task formulation: The paper formulates continual learning for NeRFs as sequentially adapting a model to new data containing different scene views, appearance changes, and geometry changes over time. This practical formulation is different from prior NeRF continual learning work that only considers static scenes with expanded data capture range. It is more similar to continual learning benchmarks in other fields like image classification that aim to learn from non-stationary data distributions.

- Approach: The proposed CLNeRF method combines generative replay and advanced NeRF architectures like NGP for efficient model adaptation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Compared to prior NeRF continual learning work that uses biased sampling and complex losses designed for vanilla NeRF, CLNeRF achieves superior performance with a simpler and generalizable design. 

- Performance: Experiments demonstrate CLNeRF provides comparable performance to the upper bound model trained on all data, even without storing historical images. It outperforms other continual learning methods by a large margin on the proposed WAT dataset. This shows the effectiveness of CLNeRF in handling practical scene changes for continual NeRF.

In summary, this paper introduces a more practical problem formulation, datasets, and solutions for continual learning in NeRF compared to prior work. The effectiveness of CLNeRF demonstrates the benefits of combining advances in continual learning and NeRF methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending CLNeRF to larger-scale datasets like Block-NeRF to study the scalability of the method. The current experiments are on relatively small scenes with hundreds of images, so applying CLNeRF to massively large scenes would be an interesting challenge.

- Investigating methods to solve the NaN loss problem with NGP architectures during continual learning. The authors mention that the issue of exploding/NaN losses in NGP prevents them from inheriting model parameters between time steps, which could potentially improve performance. Developing techniques to stabilize NGP training would enable model parameter inheritance.

- Exploring different continual learning strategies like regularization methods in addition to replay-based approaches. The authors mainly focus on replay techniques in this work, but combining replay with other methods like regularization could further improve continual learning for NeRF.

- Studying the application of CLNeRF for video view synthesis, which contains complex scene dynamics over time. Extending the ideas to video scenarios with moving objects, lighting changes, etc. would be an impactful direction.

- Applying CLNeRF to related neural scene representations beyond just Neural Radiance Fields, like Neural Volumes or Neural Rendering pipelines. The concepts could potentially translate to other neural scene models.

In summary, the main future directions are developing CLNeRF at larger scales, stabilizing training for model inheritance, combining it with other CL approaches, applying it to complex video view synthesis, and extending the ideas to other neural scene representations. The authors lay a solid groundwork that can be built upon along these research dimensions.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CLNeRF, a method for continual learning with neural radiance fields (NeRFs). The key idea is to combine generative replay with the Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) architecture to enable efficient model updates and prevent catastrophic forgetting without storing historical images. At each time step, a new set of images of a scene arrives which may contain changes in scene coverage, appearance, or geometry. CLNeRF performs generative replay by storing camera parameters of historical images to synthesize views of past data. It also adds trainable appearance and geometry embeddings to the NGP architecture so a single compact model can handle complex scene changes over time. Experiments on standard NeRF datasets and a new proposed dataset called World Across Time (WAT) demonstrate CLNeRF's effectiveness. Without storing images, it performs on par with models trained on all data and significantly better than other continual learning methods.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) Studying continual learning for NeRFs and proposing the WAT dataset with natural appearance/geometry changes over time. (2) An effective continual learning system called CLNeRF that combines generative replay and advanced NeRF architectures to enable efficient model updates and mitigate catastrophic forgetting with minimal storage needs. Experiments validate its superiority over other methods in adapting a single model to complex scene changes.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes CLNeRF, a continual learning system for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) that enables a single NeRF model to be continuously updated when new data arrives over time, without catastrophic forgetting of past data or requiring storage of historical images. CLNeRF combines generative replay with the Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) architecture. When new data arrives, generative replay uses the previous model to generate pseudo-labels on historical camera rays, providing supervision to retain performance on past data without needing to store images. NGP provides efficient training and high-quality generative replay. CLNeRF also introduces trainable appearance and geometry embeddings into NGP so a single model can handle complex scene changes over time. Experiments show CLNeRF performs on par with a model trained on all data together, even without storing historical images, and outperforms other continual learning methods.
