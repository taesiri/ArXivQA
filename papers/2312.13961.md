# [ChatGPT as a commenter to the news: can LLMs generate human-like   opinions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper investigates whether the large language model GPT-3.5 can generate human-like comments on Dutch news articles, and how to best prompt GPT-3.5 to generate such comments. Specifically, the authors examine whether GPT-3.5 comments are distinguishable from human comments.  

Methodology:
- The authors collect 10 Dutch news articles and corresponding human comments from an online news platform. 
- They generate comments using GPT-3.5 with different prompting techniques: zero-shot, few-shot (providing examples), and context (providing article introduction). They also create two personas that GPT-3.5 adopts.  
- They fine-tune a BERT classifier on human vs GPT-3.5 comments to evaluate human-likeness based on classification difficulty. Lower classifier performance implies more human-like GPT comments.
- Additional analyses include lexical diversity metrics and model explanations.

Key Findings:
- Fine-tuned BERT models achieve over 90% F1, easily distinguishing between human and GPT-3.5 comments. No prompting technique results in significantly more human-like comments. 
- Human comments exhibit higher lexical diversity than GPT-3.5 comments.
- Qualitative analysis shows GPT-3.5 tends to generate more formal, factual comments compared to opinionated human comments.  

Main Conclusions:
- GPT-3.5 has limited capability in generating human-like opinions on Dutch news, regardless of prompting technique. The complexity of human opinions remains challenging for GPT-3.5 to capture.
- Humans display higher lexical diversity in comments than GPT-3.5.
- Future work could explore GPT-4 for longer comment generation, provide more examples to GPT, or analyze pre-training time periods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the capability of GPT-3.5 to generate human-like comments on Dutch news articles using different prompting techniques and finds that GPT-3.5 is still limited in capturing the complexity of human opinions, regardless of the prompting method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an investigation into the capability of GPT-3.5 to generate human-like comments on Dutch news articles. Specifically, the authors:

1) Collect human comments from a Dutch news website and generate artificial comments using GPT-3.5 with different prompting techniques - zero-shot, few-shot, and context prompts. They also utilize two generated personas to produce more opinionated text. 

2) Evaluate the human-likeness of the GPT-3.5 generated comments by fine-tuning a Dutch BERT model to classify comments as human or AI-generated. 

3) Find that regardless of prompting technique, their fine-tuned BERT models can easily distinguish between human and GPT-generated comments. This suggests GPT-3.5's capability to create human-like opinionated comments is still limited.

4) Further analyze differences between human and GPT comments, finding human comments exhibit higher lexical diversity. They also manually inspect misclassified examples, revealing GPT's tendency to produce more formal, factual comments compared to human's more opinionated style.

In summary, the main contribution is an analysis focused specifically on GPT-3.5's capacity for generating convincing human-like opinions on Dutch news, using both automatic classification and manual analysis to evaluate performance. The authors find current abilities limited despite trying various prompting approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes different prompting techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and context prompts. How exactly do these techniques differ in the information provided to the model? What are the key strengths and weaknesses of each approach?

2. Personas are generated and provided to the model to produce more opinionated responses. However, results show this had little effect. What are some ways the personas could be made more effective in guiding the model to generate specific viewpoints? 

3. The paper imposes a strict comment length requirement based on average human comment length. How critical is controlling for length, given models can produce fluent but repetitive text? Could removing the length requirement produce different results?

4. For computational constraints, only 4 human example comments are provided in the few-shot experiments. How might increasing the number of examples impact model performance and output style/quality? What amount would be ideal?

5. The model seems to produce relatively formal, impersonal, and factual commentary compared to human data. What stylistic elements are lacking and how might the prompt design be altered to better capture human nuances? 

6. Lexical diversity is analyzed using CTTR, showing human comments have consistently higher diversity than model outputs. What other linguistic metrics could reveal insights on output quality and human-likeness?

7. The model is limited to 4,096 tokens, requiring multiple requests per prompt. How do the inconsistencies across requests impact experimental validity? How could GPT-4's higher token limit affect results?

8. Only comments from a single Dutch news source are utilized. How might incorporating diverse ideological viewpoints from additional platforms improve persona-based opinion generation?

9. The classifier achieves high performance, but are there better model architectures or training procedures to strengthen human vs. AI discrimination? 

10. Qualitative analysis reveals some model shortcomings, but are there other explainability techniques that could provide additional insights on output characteristics?
