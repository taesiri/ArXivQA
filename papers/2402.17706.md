# [Adaptive quantization with mixed-precision based on low-cost proxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17706)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Deploying deep neural networks on hardware with limited resources is challenging. Quantization methods aim to minimize computation time and energy cost while preserving accuracy. Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) assigns different bit widths to layers to balance performance, but the huge search space makes evaluating every combination infeasible. Existing methods like HAWQ don't always find the optimal configuration. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Low-Cost Proxy-Based Adaptive Mixed-Precision Model Quantization (LCPAQ) approach with three key modules:

1) Hardware-Aware Module: Considers hardware limitations like model size, bit operations (Bops), and latency. Formulates bit-width selection as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem to minimize perturbation under constraints.

2) Adaptive MPQ Module: Computes layer sensitivity using Hessian matrix trace and selects bit-widths using Pareto frontier analysis to trade off multiple objectives. Combines ILP and Pareto frontier to reduce computational load.  

3) Low-Cost Proxy NAS Module: Efficiently searches the quantization hyperparameter space using a proxy model, reducing experiment time.

Key Contributions:

- Presents adaptive mixed-precision quantization based on layer sensitivity and Pareto frontier bit-width selection

- Introduces a hardware-aware module with ILP to select bit-widths under hardware constraints 

- Uses a low-cost proxy neural architecture search to automate hyperparameter selection, accelerating search

- Achieves comparable or better accuracy than advanced quantization methods on ImageNet while reducing search time by 200x

The method is primarily designed for image classification. Future work involves expanding it to other tasks and improving proxy model accuracy.
