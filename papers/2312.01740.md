# [MobileUtr: Revisiting the relationship between light-weight CNN and   Transformer for efficient medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01740)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MobileUtr, an innovative and lightweight universal medical image segmentation network that effectively combines CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs). A key contribution is the ConvUtr block which efficiently provides denoised and non-redundant semantic embeddings to the ViT encoder. An adaptive Local-Global-Local (LGL) module is also introduced to enable effective exchange between local and global information flows, enhancing the Transformer's context modeling capacity. Experiments across ultrasound, dermoscopy, and CT datasets demonstrate MobileUtr's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving comparable or higher accuracy while requiring 10x fewer parameters and computations. The proposed innovations at the infrastructure level to synergize CNN inductive bias and ViT representational power pave the way for efficient yet accurate networks for medical vision tasks. Overall, MobileUtr sets a new benchmark as the first lightweight ViT solution that generalizes well across multiple medical imaging modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes MobileUtr, an innovative lightweight universal medical image segmentation network that effectively combines convolutional neural networks and vision transformers to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Transformer-like CNN module called ConvUtr as the patch embedding for ViT to provide denoised, non-redundant, and highly condensed semantic patches. This allows the Transformer to work more efficiently.

2. It introduces an adaptive Local-Global-Local (LGL) module between the CNN and Transformer layers to facilitate efficient exchange between local and global information flows. This enhances the Transformer's ability to capture global context. 

3. It develops an efficient and lightweight universal medical image segmentation network called MobileUtr by carefully integrating CNN and Transformer modules. Experiments show MobileUtr achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple medical image datasets while having a very compact model size and low computational cost.

In summary, the key contribution is designing a novel network architecture that strategically combines the efficiency of CNN with the representation power of Transformer to create an accurate yet lightweight universal medical image segmentation model. The proposed ConvUtr and adaptive LGL modules are vital to achieving this goal.
