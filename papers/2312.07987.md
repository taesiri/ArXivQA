# [SwitchHead: Accelerating Transformers with Mixture-of-Experts Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07987)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Transformers have become very large in scale to achieve impressive capabilities, but training them requires massive compute and memory resources due to the quadratic compute and memory complexity of the attention layers. 
- Existing methods to reduce this complexity like linear attention underperform in practice or require careful tuning of hyperparameters to avoid degenerate solutions. There is a need for better solutions.

Proposed Method
- The paper proposes SwitchHead - a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) based attention mechanism to reduce compute and memory for Transformers while matching performance.  
- SwitchHead uses MoEs only for the value and output projections of the attention, keeping the keys and queries as a single projection. This avoids conditional compute for the attention matrix.  
- The method does not require any additional regularization for stable training unlike other MoE schemes.
- SwitchHead reduces the number of attention matrices needing compute by 4-8x, providing acceleration.

Main Contributions
- Introduces SwitchHead, a novel MoE attention to reduce quadratic complexity of Transformers effectively. Matches performance of baseline Transformers with 4-8x less attention matrices.
- Achieves 1.5x wall clock training speedup over baseline Transformers with SwitchHead based on measurements.
- Combines SwitchHead with MoE MLPs to construct fully MoE SwitchFormer model that often outperforms baselines.
- Provides analysis showing SwitchHead retains expressivity - attention maps similar to baseline, with interpretable expert selections.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards reducing the immense compute and memory costs of large Transformers by proposing an efficient MoE approach for attention.
