# [SwitchHead: Accelerating Transformers with Mixture-of-Experts Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07987)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces SwitchHead, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based attention mechanism for Transformers that reduces compute and memory requirements while matching the language modeling performance of standard Transformers. SwitchHead uses MoEs for the value and output projections of the attention heads, requiring 4-8x fewer attention matrices than standard Transformers. It is based on the σ-MoE method which enables stable training without regularization tricks. Experiments across diverse datasets and model sizes show SwitchHead matches or exceeds the performance of parameter-matched baselines, with a fraction of the compute and memory budget. For example, a 47M parameter SwitchHead model achieves comparable perplexity to a 47M parameter Transformer on Wikitext-103, but with over 2x fewer MACs and over 4x less memory for attention. SwitchHead can also be combined with σ-MoE feedforward layers in a fully MoE Transformer called SwitchAll, which often outperforms dense baselines. Analysis shows the maximum attention map over SwitchHead's sparse set of heads captures similar patterns to dense baselines, indicating preservation of expressivity. The expert selections are often interpretable. Overall, SwitchHead effectively accelerates Transformers via an MoE-based attention, enabling training of large models with fewer resources.
