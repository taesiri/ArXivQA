# [Hatred Stems from Ignorance! Distillation of the Persuasion Modes in   Countering Conversational Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Counter-speech is important for combatting online hate speech, but there is limited understanding of what makes it effective. Most prior work analyzes emotional aspects like sentiment or empathy. 
- There is a need to study non-emotional persuasion factors in counter-speech across different conversation settings (closed multi-turn vs open single-turn interactions).
- No studies compare persuasion modes in human vs AI-generated counter-speech.

Proposed Solution:
- Categorize counter-speech persuasion into emotion, reason and credibility based on rhetorical appeals (ethos, logos, pathos).
- Analyze the distribution and effectiveness of these modes in closed vs open conversational interactions using two counter-speech datasets.
- Compare human and AI-generated (GPT3, Llama-2) counter-speech.
- Examine how reply stance relates to counter-speech persuasion mode.  

Main Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates incorporating persuasion modes improves hate/counter-speech detection, serving as an explainability method.
- Finds generative counter-speech relies more on emotion while human counter-speech uses reason.  
- Shows counter-speech with reason persuasion receives more support replies than emotion.
- Compares closed vs open interactions - more reason persuasion present in open interactions possibly due to public scrutiny.
- Overall provides new insights into non-emotional factors in counter-speech and how conversation structure impacts its effectiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces studying persuasion modes in counter-speech to better understand what makes it effective across diverse conversational settings and when produced by humans vs AI. Key findings highlight the greater use of reason persuasion by humans vs emotion by AI, and that reason obtains more public support.
