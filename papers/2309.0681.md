# [Searching for a Leptophilic Z' and a 3-3-1 symmetry at CLIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key aspects of this paper appear to be:- It focuses on searching for signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model at the proposed Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) through the production of a new heavy neutral gauge boson called Z'.- The models considered are a "leptophilic" Z' that couples only to leptons, and a Z' arising in a 331 model based on the SU(3) x SU(3) x U(1) gauge symmetry. - The main process analyzed is e+e- -> e+e- at a center-of-mass energy of 3 TeV, looking for a resonant peak in the e+e- invariant mass distribution.- The goal is to estimate the potential of CLIC to discover or exclude a Z' boson of various masses, using optimized selection cuts on kinematic variables like transverse momentum and pseudorapidity.- For the leptophilic Z', masses from 100 GeV to 3 TeV could be discovered or excluded with luminosities < 10 fb^-1. The 331 model requires higher luminosity due to decays into quarks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that CLIC could provide a powerful probe of new heavy neutral gauge bosons Z' that couple preferentially to leptons, complementing searches from the LHC. The analysis aims to quantify the discovery/exclusion reach at CLIC through the e+e- -> e+e- channel.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- The paper studies the potential of the proposed Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) to discover or exclude a new heavy neutral gauge boson called Z'. Specifically, it focuses on two Z' models - a leptophilic Z' that couples mainly to leptons, and a Z' arising from a 3-3-1 gauge symmetry extension of the Standard Model. - Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the signal and background processes are performed using MadGraph, Pythia, and Delphes. Signal events are generated for Z' masses between 0.5-2.5 TeV. Optimized kinematic cuts on the final state electron and positron are derived to maximize signal significance. - For the leptophilic Z', the analysis shows that CLIC can potentially discover Z' bosons in the 1-3 TeV mass range with less than 1 fb^{-1} of data. Masses up to 3 TeV can be excluded at 95% confidence level with luminosities below 10 fb^{-1}.- For the 3-3-1 Z', the reach is less compared to the leptophilic case due to additional decay channels. But CLIC can still complement LHC searches by excluding Z' masses below 2-3 TeV or discovering a multi-TeV Z' with 1-2 fb^{-1} of data.- The optimized cut-based analysis demonstrates that CLIC can probe leptophilic new physics despite having lower center-of-mass energy compared to other proposed future colliders. The results motivate using a leptophilic Z' as a benchmark model for searches at CLIC.In summary, the key contribution is a detailed signal-background simulation study of leptophilic Z' searches at CLIC showing promising discovery and exclusion potential with early data. This highlights the ability of CLIC to probe new physics coupled mainly to leptons.
