# [Leave No Patient Behind: Enhancing Medication Recommendation for Rare   Disease Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Leave No Patient Behind: Enhancing Medication Recommendation for Rare Disease Patients":

Problem:
- Existing medication recommendation systems suffer from fairness issues as they tend to provide more accurate recommendations for patients with common diseases compared to those with rare diseases. This is due to the highly skewed distribution of clinical codes in patient data, where a small subset of codes are very common while most codes occur rarely.

- Accurately modeling and recommending medications for rare diseases is challenging due to: (1) Scarce quality data due to low prevalence; (2) Intricate disease/procedure associations and relationships; (3) Tailored medication needs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel model called RAREMed which utilizes a transformer encoder architecture to capture complex relationships in clinical data. 

- It uses a unified sequence approach to jointly model diseases and procedures, allowing it to capture intricate connections between them. This sequence is encoded using segment and relevance embeddings to differentiate between code types and their significance.

- RAREMed is pre-trained on two self-supervised tasks: (1) Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) to learn contextual dependencies between codes; (2) Self Reconstruction (SR) to comprehensively capture all input codes.

- These pre-training tasks allow RAREMed to acquire robust representations of clinical codes, even with limited data, and learn specialized medication needs.

- RAREMed is fine-tuned on medication recommendation using standard losses. During inference, it recommends medications based on output probabilities.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address the fairness issue in medication recommendation where patients with rare diseases get inaccurate recommendations.

- Proposes the RAREMed model which combines pre-training techniques to learn robust representations for rare diseases, thereby improving accuracy and mitigating unfairness.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate RAREMed's superiority over existing methods in providing accurate recommendations for both rare and common disease patients.
