# [Training Artificial Neural Networks by Coordinate Search Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training artificial neural networks (ANNs) is a challenging large-scale optimization problem due to the huge number of weights that need to be optimized. 
- Gradient-based methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are efficient but have limitations - they require differentiable activation functions and cannot optimize based on multiple independent loss functions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using a tailored version of the coordinate search (CS) algorithm, which is a gradient-free optimization method, to train ANNs. 
- Key aspects of the proposed approach:
   - Uses a two-extreme point CS scheme that evaluates the lower and upper bounds of each variable's range.
   - Bundles weights into groups that are optimized simultaneously to reduce dimensions.
   - Tries different weight initialization strategies. 
   - Feeds training data in batches.

Main Contributions:
- Shows CS can be used as an alternative to SGD for training ANNs, achieves comparable accuracy to SGD on MNIST dataset.
- Converges faster than SGD, especially with small training sets.
- Can work with non-differentiable activation functions, multi-objective optimization.
- Computationally feasible to train networks with 100Ks of weights on a CPU.
- Provides insights on effects of different weight initialization and data feeding strategies.
- Has the flexibility to be applied to any ANN architecture.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a gradient-free CS algorithm as a viable alternative technique for training ANNs that addresses some limitations of current gradient-based approaches. It is generalizable, performs well, and offers advantages in some practical scenarios.
