# SINC: Spatial Composition of 3D Human Motions for Simultaneous Action
  Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is:How can we generate 3D human motions that depict multiple simultaneous actions described by free-form text input? The authors refer to generating motions with multiple simultaneous actions as "spatial composition". The key challenge is that existing text-to-motion datasets have limited examples of motions depicting more than one action at the same time. To address this, the authors propose using the language model GPT-3 to extract knowledge about which body parts are involved in different actions. This allows them to synthesize new training data by combining motions and text descriptions. Their proposed model SINC is then trained on real data plus these synthetic compositional examples. The main hypothesis is that adding such synthetic data will improve the model's ability to generate spatial compositions from new text inputs. The experiments analyze whether SINC trained with synthetic data can better handle multi-action text prompts compared to baselines.In summary, the core research question is how to do text-to-motion generation for simultaneous actions, which requires spatial composition of motions. The key idea is to use a language model to create synthetic multi-action training data to overcome the limitation of sparse real data.
