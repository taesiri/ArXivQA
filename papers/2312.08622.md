## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a systematic comparison of current defense methods against adversarial attacks in automatic speaker verification (ASV) within a unified framework. It reveals a common trade-off faced by adversarial sample purification techniques between preserving user experience and enhancing security. To address this limitation, the authors propose an ensemble-based detection approach that integrates multiple advanced purification modules such as generative and noise addition methods. This ensemble method leverages the score discrepancy between the original and purified inputs as a reliable indicator to detect adversarial samples. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in simultaneously maintaining genuine sample quality and mitigating adversarial noise. The method has merits including attack-independence, simplicity, and compatibility with future purification techniques. Experiments verify its effectiveness and robustness across diverse false detection rate settings for genuine data. Overall, the proposed ensemble framework has strong potential for defending against adversarial attacks in ASV.
