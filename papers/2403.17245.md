# [SPLICE: A Singleton-Enhanced PipeLIne for Coreference REsolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Singleton mentions (entities mentioned only once) are important for human understanding of discourse, but have been overlooked in coreference resolution systems due to lack of singleton annotations in the OntoNotes benchmark dataset.
- Previous attempts to incorporate singleton detection have limitations: rule-based methods have low precision, end-to-end trained systems are biased towards OntoNotes-style mentions, evaluating performance is hard without gold singletons.

Proposed Solution:
- Create a near-gold singleton annotated version of OntoNotes using an NP classifier trained on syntax trees from ARRAU, achieving 94% singleton recall. 
- Propose SPLICE, a two-step coreference resolution system with separate mention detection and coreference linking stages.
- Compare SPLICE to end-to-end models on OntoNotes and out-of-domain OntoGUM datasets.

Main Contributions:
- An NP classifier and near-gold OntoNotes singletons with high accuracy.
- The SPLICE system achieving comparable in-domain and improved out-of-domain results.  
- Analysis of mention detection errors showing precision improvements offer more gains than recall.
- Demonstrating that with recent NER advances, a pipeline system can match end-to-end coreference performance.
- Underscoring the value of gold singleton annotated corpora for thorough mention detection evaluation.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective way to create a singleton-annotated OntoNotes and proposes a new pipeline system for coreference resolution that leverages this to achieve state-of-the-art in and out-of-domain performance. Detailed analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of mention detection on overall coreference scores.
