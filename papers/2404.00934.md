# [ChatGLM-RLHF: Practices of Aligning Large Language Models with Human   Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT need to be aligned with human preferences to produce helpful, honest and harmless responses. 
- However, collecting reliable human preferences is challenging due to biases and deception in annotations. 
- Also, training reward and policy models at scale for large LLMs faces difficulties like reward variance, efficiency issues, and capability forgetting.

Proposed Solution - ChatGLM-RLHF Pipeline
- Collects human preference data using pairwise comparisons between model responses. Applies filtering to remove annotation biases.  
- Trains a reward model on preferences to predict response quality. Uses techniques like length-bias reduction for an unbiased model.
- Optimizes the policy model with PPO and DPO algorithms using the reward model as feedback. Implements parallelism, reward stabilization etc. for scalable training.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive pipeline to align large LLMs spanning data collection, reward and policy optimization.
- Strategies like annotation guidelines, length balancing, reference rewards to obtain unbiased and consistent human preferences.  
- Techniques for scalable RLHF training like pipeline parallelism, reward variance reduction, capability retention.
- Significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning in alignment tasks for ChatGLM-6B and 32B models.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end pipeline ChatGLM-RLHF to effectively align large chatbot models using human preferences while addressing key challenges in preference bias mitigation and large-scale training.
