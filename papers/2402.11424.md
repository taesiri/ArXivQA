# [Data Distribution Distilled Generative Model for Generalized Zero-Shot   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most generative generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) models are biased towards generating samples aligned with the seen data distribution, due to the scarcity of seen class data. This skews the models to favor seen classes over unseen classes. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an end-to-end generative GZSL framework called D3GZSL that incorporates both in-distribution (seen data) and out-of-distribution (unseen data) knowledge to reduce the bias. The framework has three main components:

1. Feature Generation (FG): Generates visual features for unseen classes using a baseline generative model. 

2. In-Distribution Dual-Space Distillation (ID2SD): Aligns the outputs of teacher and student networks in both embedding space and label space using distillation losses. This enhances learning coherence on seen data.

3. Out-of-Distribution Batch Distillation (O2DBD): Introduces a low-dimensional OOD representation per sample to capture shared structures between seen and unseen classes. The correlations between these OOD representations are modeled.

By training a unified classifier and optimizing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution aspects in an end-to-end manner, D3GZSL aligns the distribution of generated unseen samples closer to the actual data distribution.

Main Contributions:

1. A novel end-to-end generative framework D3GZSL for GZSL using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution knowledge.

2. In-distribution dual-space distillation to align teacher-student outputs in embedding and label spaces. 

3. Out-of-distribution batch distillation to model sample correlations using low-dimensional OOD representations.

4. Demonstrated consistent performance improvements by applying D3GZSL to other generative GZSL models like GANs, VAEs and diffusion models.
