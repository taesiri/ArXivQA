# [FakeWatch ElectionShield: A Benchmarking Framework to Detect Fake News   for Credible US Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of detecting fake news, which refers to false or misleading information disseminated as if it were factual. Fake news spreads rapidly, especially during events like elections, undermining credibility. Prior datasets have limitations in handling evolving data and concepts over time.  

Proposed Solution 
The paper introduces "FakeWatch ElectionShield," a novel framework to detect fake news for the 2024 US elections. The framework has 4 layers: 
1) Data Layer: Compile a new dataset of 9000 North American election news articles using advanced language models and manual verification for accuracy. Includes existing benchmark dataset.  
2) Corpus Construction Layer: Further refine dataset with robust human expert review and statistical quality control.
3) Model Development Layer: Establish comprehensive hub of machine learning and deep learning models for comparison. Includes classical models like Random Forest and advanced transformer models like BERT.
4) Evaluation Layer: Assess models thoroughly using accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.

Key Contributions
1) Compilation of tailored 2024 US Elections dataset addressing concept/data drift
2) Creation of adaptable fake news model hub spanning from classical ML to state-of-the-art transformers
3) Novel focus on upcoming 2024 US elections, pioneering dataset and models specific to this context  

Results & Conclusion
Evaluations reveal transformer models like DistilBERT perform strongly, but classical models also achieve competitive accuracy. Study provides foundation and benchmark for fake news research on future elections. Framework is comprehensive, covering data construction, model development and evaluation for tackling misinformation.
