# [LDTR: Transformer-based Lane Detection with Anchor-chain Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14354)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate lane detection remains challenging, particularly for lanes with little or no visual clues due to lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. Existing methods also struggle to precisely represent complex lane geometries such as horizontal lanes, U-turns, roundabouts, etc. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel transformer-based neural network called LDTR (lane detection transformer) for end-to-end lane detection. The key ideas and contributions are:

1. A new lane representation called "anchor-chain" that models a lane as a whole with a chain of interconnected nodes. This allows capturing lanes of any shape without complex post-processing.

2. A multi-referenced deformable attention (MRDA) module that distributes attention along the lane using the anchor-chain as position reference. This enhances perception of lanes with few visual cues. 

3. Two line IoU algorithms - point-to-point (P2P) and dense-sampling (DS) - for optimizing the overall trend and precise shape of predicted lanes respectively.

4. Additional branches for auxiliary tasks to extract finer target details.  

5. Custom evaluation metrics like parameterized F1-score, MIoU, MDis to better assess performance for downstream automated driving tasks.

Results:
Extensive experiments on CULane and CurveLanes datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Key observations:
- Outperforms previous methods in recalling lanes with sparse visual information. 
- Handles complex shapes like horizontal lanes, U-turns better.
- More accurate localization (MIoU) and shape (MDis) of recalled lanes.
- Consistently higher parameterized F1 scores over range of thresholds.

The anchor-chain representation and transformer architecture allowLDTR to robustly perceive and precisely model lane geometry for automated driving systems.
