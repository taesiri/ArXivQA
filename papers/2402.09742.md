# [AI Hospital: Interactive Evaluation and Collaboration of LLMs as Intern   Doctors for Clinical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are limitations in applying large language models (LLMs) to healthcare thus far, as their use has predominantly been restricted to discriminative and question answering tasks. This fails to fully leverage their interactive potential.

Proposed Solution - AI Hospital:  
- Develops a multi-agent framework to build a real-time interactive diagnosis environment between intern doctors (LLMs), patients, examiners and a medical director.
- Creates the intern doctor, patient and examiner agents using high-quality medical records to equip them with necessary medical knowledge. Crafts detailed backgrounds and prompts to make the agents' behaviors more natural.
- Establishes the Multi-View Medical Evaluation (MVME) benchmark on this platform to assess LLMs on their capability for interactive diagnosis across dimensions like mastery of symptoms, choice of medical examinations, and quality of final diagnosis.
- Introduces a collaborative mechanism focused on dispute resolution to improve diagnostic accuracy. Involves iterative discussions between intern doctors guided by the medical director, who summarizes disputed points to drive more focused deliberations.

Key Contributions:
- Develops the AI Hospital platform to simulate interactive clinical diagnosis and enable LLM evaluation.
- Creates the MVME benchmark to assess LLMs on interactive consultation ability.
- Validates the effectiveness of the proposed dispute resolution focused collaboration approach in improving diagnostic accuracy.
- Analyzes the performance of various LLMs and uncovers deficiencies limiting their efficacy.

In summary, the paper pioneers the application of LLMs in clinical diagnosis through an interactive multi-agent platform. The introduced collaboration methodology also demonstrates the viability of compensating for LLM deficiencies via teamwork.
