# [DORSal: Diffusion for Object-centric Representations of Scenes   $\textit{et al.}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08068)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we combine object-centric scene representations with diffusion models to generate high-fidelity novel views of complex 3D scenes while retaining object-level control for editing?The key ideas and contributions towards this goal seem to be:- Proposing DORSal, which adapts a video diffusion model architecture to be conditioned on object-centric scene representations called Object Slots. - Showing that by conditioning on Object Slots, DORSal can generate sharper and more realistic novel views compared to prior work, while retaining basic object-level editing capabilities.- Demonstrating that DORSal scales more effectively to complex real-world scenes compared to prior diffusion models for novel view synthesis.- Introducing techniques like slot dropout and view-consistent sampling strategies to improve training and enable rendering camera paths at test time.Overall, the central hypothesis appears to be that by combining the benefits of object-centric scene representations and diffusion models, DORSal can attain better novel view synthesis and editing compared to prior work in either domain individually. The experiments and results seem aimed at validating this hypothesis.
