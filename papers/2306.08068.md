# [DORSal: Diffusion for Object-centric Representations of Scenes   $\textit{et al.}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08068)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we combine object-centric scene representations with diffusion models to generate high-fidelity novel views of complex 3D scenes while retaining object-level control for editing?The key ideas and contributions towards this goal seem to be:- Proposing DORSal, which adapts a video diffusion model architecture to be conditioned on object-centric scene representations called Object Slots. - Showing that by conditioning on Object Slots, DORSal can generate sharper and more realistic novel views compared to prior work, while retaining basic object-level editing capabilities.- Demonstrating that DORSal scales more effectively to complex real-world scenes compared to prior diffusion models for novel view synthesis.- Introducing techniques like slot dropout and view-consistent sampling strategies to improve training and enable rendering camera paths at test time.Overall, the central hypothesis appears to be that by combining the benefits of object-centric scene representations and diffusion models, DORSal can attain better novel view synthesis and editing compared to prior work in either domain individually. The experiments and results seem aimed at validating this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:- Proposing DORSal, a diffusion model for generating novel 3D views of scenes conditioned on object-centric slot representations. DORSal combines object representations from OSRT with a video diffusion decoder architecture.- Demonstrating that by conditioning on object slots, DORSal can generate higher fidelity novel views compared to prior methods like OSRT and SRT, while retaining some object-level editing capabilities.- Showing that DORSal scales better to complex real-world scenes (Street View dataset) compared to the 3D diffusion model 3DiM. - Presenting analysis and experiments on challenging synthetic and real datasets, including novel view synthesis, object-level editing, and camera path rendering. The results show DORSal's improvements in novel view quality and basic object manipulability over prior methods.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating DORSal, a diffusion model conditioned on object slots for high fidelity and controllable 3D scene generation. The combination of object representations and diffusion models allows DORSal to improve upon limitations of prior work in either domain alone.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes DORSal, a method that combines object-centric scene representations with diffusion models to generate high-quality novel views of 3D scenes while retaining useful properties like object-level editing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on DORSal compares to other research in novel view synthesis and 3D scene understanding:- It builds on recent work like SRT and OSRT that learns neural scene representations across many scenes/datasets. However, it adds a diffusion model on top to generate higher quality novel views compared to prior methods like SRT/OSRT. - Compared to other diffusion models for novel view synthesis (like 3DiM), DORSal leverages an object-centric scene representation. This allows it to scale and synthesize more complex scenes compared to 3DiM, which was mainly demonstrated on single objects.- The object-centric conditioning also enables basic scene editing capabilities by removing/adding slots. This is a novel capability not shown by prior work on diffusion models or scene representations. - For scene representation, DORSal relies on a pretrained OSRT model rather than end-to-end training. This is probably for simplicity but limits the approach compared to a fully integrated model.- DORSal explores diffusion models for novel view synthesis, but does not compare to other generative models like GANs which have also been applied to this task.- The work is evaluated on both complex synthetic scenes (Multi-ShapeNet) as well as more complex real imagery (StreetView). Showing results on real data is an important step towards practical usefulness.In summary, the combination of object-centric scene representations with diffusion models is novel, and DORSal moves the state-of-the-art forward in generating and manipulating complex 3D scenes. But there remain several limitations like the two-stage training. Overall it provides promising results on an important problem at the intersection of multiple research areas.
