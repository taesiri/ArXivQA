# [Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14271)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can large language models be made to perform faithful multi-step reasoning in a way that produces humanly interpretable reasoning traces?

The key points are:

- Contemporary large language models can answer questions, but do so in an opaque, one-step manner without explaining the reasoning behind the answer. 

- The authors propose an approach to make language models perform "faithful" reasoning, where the model's computations mirror logical validity. 

- Their method chains together multiple reasoning steps, each produced by fine-tuned language models, to generate full reasoning traces that are humanly interpretable. 

- This allows users to understand the model's assumptions and logic behind its answers, verify the validity of its reasoning, and increase overall trust.

- The paper demonstrates this on multi-step logical deduction and scientific QA tasks, showing improved performance and reasoning trace validity compared to baseline models.

So in summary, the main research question is how to make large language models produce explanations for their answers via valid, multi-step reasoning traces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a model for "faithful reasoning" using large language models. The key ideas include:

- Defining faithful reasoning formally in terms of logical validity. The authors relate this to textbook definitions from formal logic.

- Proposing a model called "Selection-Inference" (SI) with a causal structure that mirrors the definition of logical validity. This allows the model to produce interpretable, step-by-step reasoning traces. 

- Using two separate fine-tuned language models for selection and inference steps to encourage logical correctness in reasoning traces.

- Introducing additional components like a learned "halter" model to determine when to stop reasoning and a learned "value function" model to guide beam search through reasoning traces.

- Evaluating the model on the ProofWriter and EntailmentBankQA datasets and showing it can produce higher-quality reasoning traces and achieve better final answer accuracy than baseline models.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel model architecture grounded in logical definitions of reasoning that can produce interpretable, faithful reasoning traces using large language models. The paper demonstrates this approach leads to improved performance on complex reasoning tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called Faithful Reasoning that uses fine-tuned language models to produce valid, step-by-step reasoning traces that justify answers to questions, enabling greater model interpretability and trust compared to standard language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are a few key ways it compares to other related research:

- Focuses specifically on using large language models (LLMs) for multi-step reasoning tasks. Much prior work has explored LLMs for question answering, but less work has focused on getting LLMs to produce full reasoning chains.

- Proposes a novel model architecture with chained reasoning steps. The Selection-Inference and halter components aim to produce reasoning traces that mirror deductive logic. This differs from typical one-shot QA approaches with LLMs.

- Evaluates performance on multi-hop reasoning datasets like ProofWriter and EntailmentBank. Using these specialized benchmarks allows targeted analysis of multi-step reasoning abilities.

- Puts emphasis on trace validity and faithfulness. The paper analyzes whether reasoning traces logically follow from premises, unlike most QA work that focuses only on final accuracy.

- Introduces novel training strategies like the value function learner to improve trace quality. This demonstrates ways to optimize models to produce more logical and human-interpretable chains of reasoning.

Overall, this paper pushes forward research on getting LLMs to reason in more structured, transparent ways compared to typical black-box QA applications. The analysis on logical validity and trace faithfulness is a useful contribution on top of improving multi-step reasoning performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the model to incorporate retrieval, rather than relying solely on a provided context. As the authors note, in most real-world settings a full context would not be provided, so retrieval methods could be used to populate the context from sources like the web or a knowledge base.

- Applying the faithful reasoning approach to other domains beyond logical deduction and science QA, such as narrative understanding, procedural reasoning, mathematical reasoning, etc. The authors suggest the potential for algorithmic prompting and causal models like theirs to elicit more sophisticated reasoning in language models across diverse domains.

- Combining the faithful reasoning approach with other methods like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative fine-tuning that have shown promise in improving language model reasoning. The authors mention leveraging these other techniques as complementary ways to enhance reasoning performance.

- Developing better methods for representing the knowledge and reasoning, such as using more structured representations instead of just text. The authors suggest this could further improve interpretability and validity of the reasoning traces.

- Exploring other search algorithms and improvements to the search process, beyond just beam search guided by the learned value function. More advanced search could further boost the quality of the generated reasoning traces.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: extending the approach to retrieval and other domains, integrating with other reasoning-enhancing methods, using more structured knowledge representations, and improving the search algorithm. The overall goal is to advance towards more capable and interpretable reasoning with language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a method for creating faithful reasoning models using large language models (LLMs). The authors define faithful reasoning as reasoning that mirrors definitions of logical validity, producing interpretable reasoning traces that justify the model's answers. They propose a Selection-Inference (SI) model that performs chained, multi-step reasoning where each step consists of a selection LLM choosing relevant facts and an inference LLM deriving a new fact from those selections. This causal structure guarantees the traces are valid if selections use only the given context and inferences are correct. Additional components halt reasoning and guide search over reasoning traces. Experiments on deduction and science QA datasets show SI outperforms baselines in accuracy while producing superior reasoning traces. The traces allow identifying model mistakes and assessing if conclusions are justified. Overall, the work demonstrates how algorithmic prompting of LLMs can elicit more sophisticated, trustworthy reasoning without compromising performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for developing language models that can perform multi-step logical reasoning in a way that is interpretable and verifiable by humans. The key idea is to structure the model to mirror formal definitions of logical validity, ensuring the reasoning process has a valid logical form. 

The model consists of two main components: Selection and Inference. Given a question and context, the Selection model chooses relevant statements from the context as a basis for reasoning. The Inference model then deduces a new statement from these selections. By chaining together multiple iterations of Selection and Inference, multi-step reasoning traces can be generated. Additional components are introduced for determining when to halt the reasoning process and return an answer, and for guiding search through the space of possible reasoning traces. The model is evaluated on multi-step deduction and science question answering tasks, demonstrating improved performance and reasoning quality compared to baseline models. A key advantage is the ability to expose interpretable reasoning traces whose validity users can manually check.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a model called Selection-Inference (SI) for performing multi-step reasoning in a way that produces interpretable and verifiable reasoning traces. The backbone of the model is composed of two components - a Selection LM and an Inference LM. Given a question and context, the Selection LM selects relevant statements from the context. These statements are passed to the Inference LM, which produces a logical inference/conclusion from them. This pairing of selection and inference constitutes one reasoning step. Multiple iterations of this process produce a full reasoning trace leading to the answer. To improve trace quality, the model utilizes two additional components - a learned Value Function to score traces and guide beam search, and a Halter LM to determine when to halt tracing and output the final answer. The causal structure of the chained selection and inference steps mirrors the formal definition of logical validity, enabling the model to produce human-interpretable reasoning traces.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, the main problem this paper is addressing is how to develop large language models that can perform multi-step reasoning in a way that is interpretable and logical for humans. Specifically, the authors aim to create models that can produce reasoning traces that:

- Mirror the underlying logical structure of a problem, ensuring the reasoning is valid.

- Allow users to understand how the model reached its conclusions by exposing the assumptions and intermediate reasoning steps. 

- Avoid reliance on biases or priors encoded in the model's weights, instead focusing on logical deduction from a given context.

The authors argue that while large language models like GPT-3 are impressive at question answering, their reasoning process is opaque and they may "cheat" by relying on information in their weights rather than properly reasoning over a given context. This lack of transparency and potential to perpetuate biases makes it hard to trust these black-box models. 

To address this, the authors propose an approach called "faithful reasoning" where the model's computations mirror definitions of logical validity. Their model produces human-interpretable reasoning traces that allow checking the validity of the conclusions drawn.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for large language models (LLMs) to perform faithful multi-step reasoning in a way that mirrors logical validity. The authors introduce Selection-Inference (SI), a causal model consisting of a Selection LLM that chooses relevant statements from a context and an Inference LLM that deduces new statements from those selections. By preventing the Inference LLM from seeing the original question, the model is forced to rely on its reasoning trace, rather than using shortcuts or biases. To improve the quality of traces, the authors also incorporate a learned Value function to score traces and guide a beam search. When evaluated on the ProofWriter and EntailmentBankQA datasets, this model outperforms baselines in final answer accuracy while producing human-interpretable reasoning traces. The validity of traces is further supported by the model's ability to leverage context statements rather than hallucinating facts. Overall, this work represents an important step towards more transparent reasoning from large language models. The faithful reasoning approach helps address concerns around model opacity and bias, while retaining strong performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new model called Faithful Reasoning that is able to perform logical, multi-step reasoning and generate human-interpretable explanations to justify its answers. The model is composed of two main components: Selection-Inference (SI) and a Halter. SI performs valid forward-chaining reasoning by alternating between selecting relevant facts from a context and inferring new information from those facts. The inferences are chained together into full reasoning traces. The Halter module determines when to stop the reasoning process and converts the trace into a final answer. To find high-quality reasoning traces, the authors also introduce a learned value function to guide beam search through the space of possible traces. Experiments on two multi-hop reasoning datasets, ProofWriter and EntailmentBankQA, demonstrate that the Faithful Reasoning approach produces more accurate answers and higher-quality reasoning traces compared to baseline methods like chained language model prompting. The model is also better able to determine when it does not have enough information to answer a question. By generating interpretable reasoning in a way that mirrors logical definitions of validity, this work represents an important step towards more trustworthy and transparent reasoning with large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the Selection-Inference (SI) model ensure that the reasoning traces it produces are connected (do not hallucinate facts)? What mechanisms prevent the Selection model from generating facts not present in the context?

2. The Inference model is prevented from having direct access to the original question. How does this constraint encourage the model to produce logically valid reasoning steps? What problems could arise if the Inference model was allowed to "see" the original question?

3. Explain the motivation behind using a learned Value Function to guide beam search through the space of possible reasoning traces. Why is exhaustive search intractable, necessitating the use of heuristics like beam search? 

4. What are some potential downsides or limitations of using a learned Value Function versus an analytic scoring function? For example, how could the Value Function potentially bias or constrain the search process?

5. The Halter model serves two purposes - determining when reasoning should terminate and formatting the final answer. Discuss the tradeoffs in using a single model for both functions rather than separate specialized models. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks?

6. How robust is the overall pipeline to errors in the individual components like Selection, Inference, Halter, and Value Function? For example, if the Inference model produces an invalid conclusion, can the pipeline recover or does this doom the entire trace?

7. The validity guarantees of the model rely on assumptions like the Inference model producing logically valid steps. How could the overall pipeline be modified to be more robust to violations of these assumptions? What mechanisms could detect invalid reasoning steps?

8. Does the model have any inherent limitations in the types of reasoning problems it can handle? For example, can it reason about complex real-world situations or is it mostly constrained to logical/mathematical domains?

9. How does this model compare to other approaches for generating interpretable reasoning from large language models? What are some key advantages and disadvantages compared to methods like chain of thought prompting?

10. What are some key challenges or directions for future work in scaling up this approach to even more complex reasoning tasks? How could the modular pipeline design be leveraged or extended?
