# Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models be made to perform faithful multi-step reasoning in a way that produces humanly interpretable reasoning traces?The key points are:- Contemporary large language models can answer questions, but do so in an opaque, one-step manner without explaining the reasoning behind the answer. - The authors propose an approach to make language models perform "faithful" reasoning, where the model's computations mirror logical validity. - Their method chains together multiple reasoning steps, each produced by fine-tuned language models, to generate full reasoning traces that are humanly interpretable. - This allows users to understand the model's assumptions and logic behind its answers, verify the validity of its reasoning, and increase overall trust.- The paper demonstrates this on multi-step logical deduction and scientific QA tasks, showing improved performance and reasoning trace validity compared to baseline models.So in summary, the main research question is how to make large language models produce explanations for their answers via valid, multi-step reasoning traces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a model for "faithful reasoning" using large language models. The key ideas include:- Defining faithful reasoning formally in terms of logical validity. The authors relate this to textbook definitions from formal logic.- Proposing a model called "Selection-Inference" (SI) with a causal structure that mirrors the definition of logical validity. This allows the model to produce interpretable, step-by-step reasoning traces. - Using two separate fine-tuned language models for selection and inference steps to encourage logical correctness in reasoning traces.- Introducing additional components like a learned "halter" model to determine when to stop reasoning and a learned "value function" model to guide beam search through reasoning traces.- Evaluating the model on the ProofWriter and EntailmentBankQA datasets and showing it can produce higher-quality reasoning traces and achieve better final answer accuracy than baseline models.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel model architecture grounded in logical definitions of reasoning that can produce interpretable, faithful reasoning traces using large language models. The paper demonstrates this approach leads to improved performance on complex reasoning tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach called Faithful Reasoning that uses fine-tuned language models to produce valid, step-by-step reasoning traces that justify answers to questions, enabling greater model interpretability and trust compared to standard language models.
