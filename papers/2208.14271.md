# Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models be made to perform faithful multi-step reasoning in a way that produces humanly interpretable reasoning traces?The key points are:- Contemporary large language models can answer questions, but do so in an opaque, one-step manner without explaining the reasoning behind the answer. - The authors propose an approach to make language models perform "faithful" reasoning, where the model's computations mirror logical validity. - Their method chains together multiple reasoning steps, each produced by fine-tuned language models, to generate full reasoning traces that are humanly interpretable. - This allows users to understand the model's assumptions and logic behind its answers, verify the validity of its reasoning, and increase overall trust.- The paper demonstrates this on multi-step logical deduction and scientific QA tasks, showing improved performance and reasoning trace validity compared to baseline models.So in summary, the main research question is how to make large language models produce explanations for their answers via valid, multi-step reasoning traces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a model for "faithful reasoning" using large language models. The key ideas include:- Defining faithful reasoning formally in terms of logical validity. The authors relate this to textbook definitions from formal logic.- Proposing a model called "Selection-Inference" (SI) with a causal structure that mirrors the definition of logical validity. This allows the model to produce interpretable, step-by-step reasoning traces. - Using two separate fine-tuned language models for selection and inference steps to encourage logical correctness in reasoning traces.- Introducing additional components like a learned "halter" model to determine when to stop reasoning and a learned "value function" model to guide beam search through reasoning traces.- Evaluating the model on the ProofWriter and EntailmentBankQA datasets and showing it can produce higher-quality reasoning traces and achieve better final answer accuracy than baseline models.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel model architecture grounded in logical definitions of reasoning that can produce interpretable, faithful reasoning traces using large language models. The paper demonstrates this approach leads to improved performance on complex reasoning tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach called Faithful Reasoning that uses fine-tuned language models to produce valid, step-by-step reasoning traces that justify answers to questions, enabling greater model interpretability and trust compared to standard language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are a few key ways it compares to other related research:- Focuses specifically on using large language models (LLMs) for multi-step reasoning tasks. Much prior work has explored LLMs for question answering, but less work has focused on getting LLMs to produce full reasoning chains.- Proposes a novel model architecture with chained reasoning steps. The Selection-Inference and halter components aim to produce reasoning traces that mirror deductive logic. This differs from typical one-shot QA approaches with LLMs.- Evaluates performance on multi-hop reasoning datasets like ProofWriter and EntailmentBank. Using these specialized benchmarks allows targeted analysis of multi-step reasoning abilities.- Puts emphasis on trace validity and faithfulness. The paper analyzes whether reasoning traces logically follow from premises, unlike most QA work that focuses only on final accuracy.- Introduces novel training strategies like the value function learner to improve trace quality. This demonstrates ways to optimize models to produce more logical and human-interpretable chains of reasoning.Overall, this paper pushes forward research on getting LLMs to reason in more structured, transparent ways compared to typical black-box QA applications. The analysis on logical validity and trace faithfulness is a useful contribution on top of improving multi-step reasoning performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the model to incorporate retrieval, rather than relying solely on a provided context. As the authors note, in most real-world settings a full context would not be provided, so retrieval methods could be used to populate the context from sources like the web or a knowledge base.- Applying the faithful reasoning approach to other domains beyond logical deduction and science QA, such as narrative understanding, procedural reasoning, mathematical reasoning, etc. The authors suggest the potential for algorithmic prompting and causal models like theirs to elicit more sophisticated reasoning in language models across diverse domains.- Combining the faithful reasoning approach with other methods like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative fine-tuning that have shown promise in improving language model reasoning. The authors mention leveraging these other techniques as complementary ways to enhance reasoning performance.- Developing better methods for representing the knowledge and reasoning, such as using more structured representations instead of just text. The authors suggest this could further improve interpretability and validity of the reasoning traces.- Exploring other search algorithms and improvements to the search process, beyond just beam search guided by the learned value function. More advanced search could further boost the quality of the generated reasoning traces.In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: extending the approach to retrieval and other domains, integrating with other reasoning-enhancing methods, using more structured knowledge representations, and improving the search algorithm. The overall goal is to advance towards more capable and interpretable reasoning with language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a method for creating faithful reasoning models using large language models (LLMs). The authors define faithful reasoning as reasoning that mirrors definitions of logical validity, producing interpretable reasoning traces that justify the model's answers. They propose a Selection-Inference (SI) model that performs chained, multi-step reasoning where each step consists of a selection LLM choosing relevant facts and an inference LLM deriving a new fact from those selections. This causal structure guarantees the traces are valid if selections use only the given context and inferences are correct. Additional components halt reasoning and guide search over reasoning traces. Experiments on deduction and science QA datasets show SI outperforms baselines in accuracy while producing superior reasoning traces. The traces allow identifying model mistakes and assessing if conclusions are justified. Overall, the work demonstrates how algorithmic prompting of LLMs can elicit more sophisticated, trustworthy reasoning without compromising performance.
