# [Information Flow Routes: Automatically Interpreting Language Models at   Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00824)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current large language models (LMs) like LLMs and GPT are based on the Transformer architecture, where computations happen through a sequence of residual streams connected by attention and feedforward layers. 
- It is not well understood how information flows through these complex networks to make predictions. Prior work has tried to explain predictions by finding specific "circuits" using activation patching, but this has limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent computations inside LMs as information flow graphs, where nodes are token representations and edges are model components. 
- Extract the subset of this graph that is most important for each prediction in a top-down manner using attribution instead of patching. This builds an "information flow route" explaining the prediction.
- Evaluate edge importances proportional to the similarity of update vectors to the overall sum, based on the ALTI attribution method.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose explaining LM predictions through information flow routes, which are more versatile, efficient, and widely applicable than patching circuits.

2) Show the approach can recover previously found task-specific circuits, but also find other important components overlooked by patching. Further, it avoids fragility in patching based on choice of contrastive example.  

3) Analyze information flow in LLMs to find generally important attention heads like previous token and subword merging heads across predictions.

4) Discover cases where residual connections strangely act as beginning-of-sentence tokens when they should not. 

5) Demonstrate model components can specialize for specific domains/languages, with specialized heads emitting highly interpretable concepts.
