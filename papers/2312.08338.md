## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new approach to generalizable novel view synthesis called global latent neural rendering. The key idea is to learn a model that renders novel views by operating jointly over all camera rays, instead of treating each ray independently. To enable this global rendering, the method represents the input views as a plane sweep volume (PSV) that encodes the epipolar geometry. Based on this representation, the authors propose Convolutional Global Latent Renderer (ConvGLR), an efficient convolutional architecture with four main steps: it first groups the depths of the PSV, then aggregates information across views, performs latent rendering by progressively collapsing the depth dimension, and finally upsamples the rendered representation. Experiments across multiple datasets and settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods that rely on independent ray rendering. The global latent rendering proves more effective at aggregating information across views and reducing grainy artifacts. By revisiting plane sweep volumes and learning to render images jointly, this work opens promising research directions for generalizable novel view synthesis.
