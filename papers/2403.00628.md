# [Region-Adaptive Transform with Segmentation Prior for Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00628)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing learned image compression (LIC) methods use CNNs or self-attention models to learn fixed or image-specific transforms. However, they do not focus on region-specific transforms that can better capture complex image signals. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called Segmentation-Prior-Guided Image Compression (SegPIC) that learns region-adaptive transforms using class-agnostic segmentation masks as privileged information during training. Two key modules are proposed:

1) Region-Adaptive Transform (RAT): Performs a novel Depth&Point-wise Separable Convolution where the weights are generated dynamically based on region prototypes and feature contexts under the guidance of masks.

2) Scale Affine Layer (SAL): Enriches region prototypes by affining features to incorporate richer semantics and contexts. 

The masks guide the model during training to focus on complex semantic regions prone to distortion. Uniform grid partitions are used during inference so no extra information needs to be transmitted.

Key Contributions:

- First work to employ class-agnostic masks as privileged information for learned region-adaptive transforms in image compression.

- Proposed two lightweight and effective modules - RAT and SAL. RAT allows adaptive transform kernels for different regions. SAL enriches feature representations.

- Demonstrated BD-rate savings of 8.18% on Kodak and 8.26% on CLIC compared to the state-of-the-art VTM codec.

- Analyzed the role of masks during training in focusing model attention on complex semantic regions. Showed comparable performance without masks during inference.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach for segmentation mask guided region-adaptive transforms to achieve improved learned image compression performance. The masks provide useful guidance during training without increasing overhead during deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a learned image compression method called Segmentation-Prior-Guided Image Compression (SegPIC) that utilizes class-agnostic segmentation masks as privilege information during training to guide a region-adaptive transform module and improve compression performance, without needing the masks during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel image compression framework called Segmentation-Prior-Guided Image Compression (SegPIC), equipped with two proposed modules: Region-Adaptive Transform (RAT) and Scale Affine Layer (SAL).

2. Adopting class-agnostic masks as privilege information to assist the training of SegPIC. The "class-agnostic" property promotes learning a compression-driven semantic prior, while the "privilege" way avoids additional bitrate and complexity for masks during inference. 

3. Demonstrating through experiments that SegPIC is superior to previous well-performing image compression methods in terms of rate-distortion performance.

4. Analyzing the role of the segmentation masks, and showing experimentally and visually that the masks guide the model to focus more on semantic objects during training, leading to higher pixel-fidelity performance.

In summary, the key innovation is using segmentation masks in a "class-agnostic" and "privilege" way to guide the learning of region-adaptive transforms for improved image compression performance.
