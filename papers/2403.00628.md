# [Region-Adaptive Transform with Segmentation Prior for Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00628)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing learned image compression (LIC) methods use CNNs or self-attention models to learn fixed or image-specific transforms. However, they do not focus on region-specific transforms that can better capture complex image signals. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called Segmentation-Prior-Guided Image Compression (SegPIC) that learns region-adaptive transforms using class-agnostic segmentation masks as privileged information during training. Two key modules are proposed:

1) Region-Adaptive Transform (RAT): Performs a novel Depth&Point-wise Separable Convolution where the weights are generated dynamically based on region prototypes and feature contexts under the guidance of masks.

2) Scale Affine Layer (SAL): Enriches region prototypes by affining features to incorporate richer semantics and contexts. 

The masks guide the model during training to focus on complex semantic regions prone to distortion. Uniform grid partitions are used during inference so no extra information needs to be transmitted.

Key Contributions:

- First work to employ class-agnostic masks as privileged information for learned region-adaptive transforms in image compression.

- Proposed two lightweight and effective modules - RAT and SAL. RAT allows adaptive transform kernels for different regions. SAL enriches feature representations.

- Demonstrated BD-rate savings of 8.18% on Kodak and 8.26% on CLIC compared to the state-of-the-art VTM codec.

- Analyzed the role of masks during training in focusing model attention on complex semantic regions. Showed comparable performance without masks during inference.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach for segmentation mask guided region-adaptive transforms to achieve improved learned image compression performance. The masks provide useful guidance during training without increasing overhead during deployment.
