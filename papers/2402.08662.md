# [Learning Emergent Gaits with Decentralized Phase Oscillators: on the   role of Observations, Rewards, and Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08662)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quadruped robot controllers typically rely on a fixed gait pattern, which simplifies control but limits flexibility. Using reinforcement learning (RL) also often requires extensive reward shaping based on a predefined gait.
- It is challenging to design rewards that encourage a general notion of "locomote with a regular gait" without overspecifying the solution.

Proposed Solution:
- Augment robot state with decentralized phase oscillators, one per leg. Oscillator phase provides observation to make policy Markov.
- Simple phase-based rewards encourage swing/stance without dictating gait. 
- Ground reaction forces locally couple oscillator to leg dynamics (interpreted as observer feedback gain).

Key Contributions:
- Systematic ablation study analyzing importance of phase observations, rewards, and coupling.
- Phase observations + rewards induce policies that use all legs evenly and exhibit emergent gait preferences, without prescribing specific gaits.
- Feedback coupling causes faster convergence to symmetric gaits compared to just phase observations + rewards.
- All three signals together yield most robust policies to disturbances, compared to other ablation combinations.

In summary, the paper presents a minimal architecture using decentralized phase oscillators to enable quadruped policies to learn various emergent gaits, through the combination of phase observations, simple phase-based rewards, and local feedback coupling. The ablation study provides insight into the role of each signal.
