# [Textually Pretrained Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether textual language models can be used to improve generative spoken language models (GSLMs). Specifically, the authors propose a method called TWIST for initializing and training GSLMs using pretrained textual language models, and investigate whether this "warm start" from textual models helps GSLMs generate better quality and more natural speech compared to models trained from scratch ("cold start"). The key hypothesis appears to be that despite speech and text operating at very different granularities (speech tokens capturing 20-40ms windows vs. text tokens spanning longer linguistic concepts), the close connection between speech and text means that transferring knowledge from textual LMs can benefit GSLMs. The authors test this hypothesis through extensive experiments initializing GSLMs of various sizes from different pretrained textual LMs.In summary, the main research question is whether warm-starting GSLMs from textual LMs improves performance compared to cold-start GSLMs, with the hypothesis that speech and text are closely connected enough for textual LM knowledge transfer to help GSLMs generate better quality speech. The paper aims to empirically test this hypothesis through their proposed TWIST initialization method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be introducing TWIST, a method for training generative spoken language models (GSLMs) using a warm start from pretrained textual language models. The key ideas are:- Initializing the weights of a GSLM from a pretrained text LM before further training on speech data. This is shown to consistently improve performance across various metrics compared to training a GSLM from scratch.- Conducting extensive experiments analyzing different components of GSLMs like the speech tokenizer, model architecture, dataset scale etc. to understand what factors impact performance. - Based on these analyses, training the largest GSLM to date with 7B parameters on ~150k hours of speech data.- Introducing two new spoken versions of the StoryCloze benchmark to better evaluate contextual understanding of GSLMs.So in summary, the main contributions are:1) Proposing TWIST, a simple but effective method to initialize GSLMs from textual LMs. 2) Providing extensive empirical analysis of different GSLM components.3) Training the largest GSLM model. 4) Introducing new spoken benchmarks for evaluating GSLMs.The key insight seems to be that despite the difference in granularity between speech and text, textual LM pretraining can still significantly benefit GSLMs. The analyses also highlight the importance of model scale and data size for improving GSLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Textually Warm Initialized Speech Transformer Language Models (TWIST), a method to improve generative spoken language modeling by first pretraining a text language model and then adapting it to process and generate acoustic speech data.
