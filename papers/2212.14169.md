# [Discriminator-Cooperated Feature Map Distillation for GAN Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14169)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can knowledge distillation be improved to enable better compression and performance of GAN models?Specifically, the paper investigates incorporating the discriminator more effectively into the knowledge distillation process for GAN compression. The key ideas proposed are:1) Using the teacher discriminator as a learned transformation to match intermediate feature maps from the student and teacher generators. This aims to encourage perceptual similarity rather than pixel-level matching. 2) Collaborative adversarial training where the teacher discriminator co-trains with the student generator. This helps mitigate mode collapse during GAN compression.3) Combining these two ideas - discriminator-cooperated distillation (DCD) and collaborative adversarial training - to develop a GAN compression framework that outperforms prior work.The central hypothesis appears to be that utilizing the discriminator more effectively in distillation can lead to better performing and more compressed GANs compared to prior distillation techniques like pixel-level feature matching. The paper presents experiments on compressing CycleGAN and Pix2Pix models to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a novel discriminator-cooperated distillation (DCD) method to transfer feature map knowledge from a teacher GAN generator to a student generator. This aims to optimize the compressed student generator to generate perceptually better images. 2. Using the teacher discriminator as a "transformation" to pursue better visual perception in the student generator's outputs, rather than just pixel-to-pixel matching between student and teacher feature maps.3. Introducing a collaborative adversarial training paradigm that allows the teacher discriminator to co-train with the student generator, avoiding issues like mode collapse.4. Demonstrating significant performance improvements and complexity reduction on benchmark datasets like horse2zebra, summer2winter, and edges2shoes using compressed CycleGAN and Pix2Pix models.In summary, the key novelty seems to be using the teacher discriminator in a novel way during distillation to improve the student generator's outputs, as well as the collaborative adversarial training approach. Both aim to boost the performance of a lightweight compressed GAN generator.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel discriminator-cooperated distillation method to transfer feature map knowledge from a teacher GAN to a compressed student GAN for better image generation, using the teacher discriminator as a transformation and collaborative adversarial training to optimize the student generator.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key ways this work compares to other research on GAN compression:- It focuses specifically on improving the effectiveness of knowledge distillation for GAN compression, whereas much prior work has focused more on pruning and quantization techniques. Feature map distillation has been used before for GAN compression, but this paper argues it is not well suited due to the difference between GAN image generation and classification tasks.- The proposed discriminator-cooperated distillation (DCD) method is novel in utilizing the discriminator more extensively to guide feature map distillation, rather than just using it on the final image outputs. The idea of incorporating the discriminator into distillation makes sense given its role in GAN training.- The collaborative adversarial training approach also differentiates this work by allowing joint training of the teacher discriminator with the student generator. This helps address instability and mode collapse issues that can occur when training a weak student against a strong pre-trained discriminator.- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on compressing CycleGAN and Pix2Pix models, significantly outperforming prior GAN compression techniques including the most relevant prior feature map distillation works. For example, the paper shows 13.29 better FID on a 40x compressed CycleGAN compared to the prior best method.- The analysis provides useful insights into why utilizing the discriminator and collaborative training helps, and how the approach differs from perceptual loss techniques.In summary, this paper advances GAN compression research specifically through more sophisticated feature map distillation techniques leveraging the discriminator, with both modeling innovations and superior experimental results compared to prior art. The focus on better knowledge transfer for GANs differentiates it from other general model compression techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring different architectures for the student generator beyond just reducing channels of the teacher ResNet, such as using neural architecture search to find optimal student architectures. - Experimenting with other GAN models besides CycleGAN and Pix2Pix, such as StyleGAN which can control various attributes during image generation.- Applying the proposed methods to other generative models besides GANs, like variational autoencoders.- Further exploring the use of the discriminator in knowledge distillation for GANs, such as using multiple discriminators or creating student discriminators.- Combining the proposed distillation approach with other GAN compression techniques like pruning and quantization for even greater compression ratios.- Evaluating the method on a wider range of datasets and domains, including more complex and high-resolution image datasets.- Extending the ideas to conditional GANs and video generation models.- Exploring theoretical understanding of why the proposed distillation approach works well for GAN compression.So in summary, the main future directions are around exploring architectural variants, other models beyond GANs, combining compression techniques, more comprehensive evaluation, and theoretical analysis. The overall goal is pushing GAN compression even further.
