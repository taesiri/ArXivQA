# [Computational Sentence-level Metrics Predicting Human Sentence   Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior research on language processing has focused on predicting word processing, but there is a lack of computational methods for modeling whole sentence comprehension. Sentence-level metrics are needed to evaluate context effects and overall difficulty in understanding entire sentences. 

- Two key factors influencing sentence processing are (1) expectations about upcoming sentences based on context (surprisal) and (2) integration with context based on semantic relevance. Word-level surprisal and relevance have been shown to independently impact word processing. It is unclear if similar sentence-level versions of these metrics could predict sentence processing.

Methodology:
- Proposed sentence-level metrics: 
    - Sentence surprisal: negative log probability of a sentence given previous context 
    - Sentence relevance: semantic similarity between the current sentence and context, computed using an attention-aware approach
- Used multilingual BERT (m-BERT) and multilingual GPT (mGPT) to compute these metrics
- Evaluated on eye-tracking reading speed data from 13 languages in the Multilingual Eye-tracking Corpus (MECO)
- Compared GAMM models with different metrics using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)  

Key Results:
- Both sentence surprisal and sentence relevance significantly predicted reading speed across languages
- Combining surprisal and relevance improved predictions compared to using either alone  
- Surprisal (m-BERT + chain rule) and relevance (m-BERT) were optimal methods
- Generalized well across diverse languages

Main Contributions:
- First proposed computational methods to model sentence processing difficulty 
- Showed sentence surprisal and relevance capture distinct effects on comprehension
- Demonstrated strong predictability of reading speed across languages
- Highlighted potential of combining language models with cognitive models to explain human language processing

In summary, this paper introduced innovative sentence-level metrics that effectively predict sentence processing difficulty across languages. The results highlight opportunities for using computational models to advance cognitive modeling of discourse comprehension.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces innovative methods for computing sentence-level surprisal and relevance using multilingual language models, which are shown to effectively predict human sentence reading speeds across 13 languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing innovative methods to compute sentence-level metrics (sentence surprisal and sentence relevance) using multilingual large language models, and demonstrating that these metrics are highly effective in predicting human sentence reading speeds across multiple languages. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Putting forth the concepts of "sentence surprisal" and "sentence relevance" as metrics to model sentence processing difficulty and relevance to context during reading. This expands existing word-level metrics like word surprisal and word relevance to the sentence level.

2) Presenting methods to compute sentence surprisal using chain rule, next sentence prediction, and negative log likelihood approaches with mBERT and mGPT models. And computing sentence relevance using an attention-aware similarity method.

3) Testing the predictive power of these metrics against human reading speed data from a multilingual eye-tracking corpus spanning 13 languages. The metrics demonstrate strong generalizability across languages. 

4) Highlighting that both sentence surprisal and relevance contribute to predicting reading difficulty, suggesting an interplay of expectation and memory factors in human sentence processing.

In summary, the key innovation is developing interpretable sentence-level computational metrics grounded in cognitive theory, and showing they effectively predict human reading comprehension across languages. This opens up avenues to better model discourse-level language understanding.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Sentence surprisal - A measure of the unpredictability or information content of an entire sentence, similar to word surprisal but at the sentence level. Computed using chain rule, next sentence prediction, or negative log likelihood with multilingual BERT or GPT.

- Sentence relevance - A measure of the semantic relatedness of a sentence to its surrounding context. Computed using an attention-aware approach that weights the similarity of the target sentence to context sentences based on distance.  

- Reading speed - The response variable, measured as number of words per second for a sentence. Used to assess processing difficulty. Slower reading indicates more difficulty.

- Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) - The statistical method used to evaluate how well the computational metrics predict reading speed across languages. Compared models using change in AIC.

- Multilingual eye-tracking corpus (MECO) - The dataset analyzed, containing eye-tracking information for readers of 13 languages reading encyclopedia passages. 

- Language generalization - A goal of the paper in testing whether the computational metrics effectively predict reading speed across multiple languages for cross-linguistic generalization.

- Cognitive modeling - The broader motivation of connecting computational models and metrics to human language processing and comprehension.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two new sentence-level metrics: sentence surprisal and sentence relevance. What is the motivation behind developing these metrics and how do they differ from existing word-level metrics like word surprisal and word relevance?

2. The paper computes sentence surprisal using three methods: chain rule (CR), next sentence prediction (NSP), and negative log-likelihood (NLL). Can you explain in detail how each of these methods work and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? 

3. The chain rule method for computing sentence surprisal relies on breaking down the probability of a sentence into conditional probabilities of its constituent words. What assumptions does this make and how could it potentially fall short in capturing the true surprisal of a sentence?

4. What is the justification provided in the paper for using the "[CLS]" token embedding from BERT as a sentence embedding? What are some potential limitations of this approach for representing sentence meaning? 

5. The paper argues that combining sentence surprisal and sentence relevance provides a more comprehensive view of sentence processing difficulty. What is the theoretical basis behind this argument? How do surprisal and relevance interact during language comprehension?

6. Explain the attention-aware approach used to compute sentence relevance. What linguistic or cognitive motivations underlie the use of positional weights in this method? 

7. The statistical analysis relies heavily on Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs). What are some of the major advantages of using GAMMs over simpler regression techniques for this application?

8. One evaluation criterion used is the difference in AIC values between base and full models. Explain what AIC represents and why Î”AIC is an appropriate metric for comparative assessment. What are its limitations?

9. The paper demonstrates predictions across 13 languages using multilingual BERT and GPT. What difficulties might arise in applying these models evenly across such diverse languages? How could the approach account for differences in linguistic typologies? 

10. The conclusion states that combining computational models with cognitive models shows promise. What examples are provided in the paper of integrating computational metrics with theories of human language processing? How can this be taken further?
