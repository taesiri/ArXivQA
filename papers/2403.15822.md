# [Computational Sentence-level Metrics Predicting Human Sentence   Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior research on language processing has focused on predicting word processing, but there is a lack of computational methods for modeling whole sentence comprehension. Sentence-level metrics are needed to evaluate context effects and overall difficulty in understanding entire sentences. 

- Two key factors influencing sentence processing are (1) expectations about upcoming sentences based on context (surprisal) and (2) integration with context based on semantic relevance. Word-level surprisal and relevance have been shown to independently impact word processing. It is unclear if similar sentence-level versions of these metrics could predict sentence processing.

Methodology:
- Proposed sentence-level metrics: 
    - Sentence surprisal: negative log probability of a sentence given previous context 
    - Sentence relevance: semantic similarity between the current sentence and context, computed using an attention-aware approach
- Used multilingual BERT (m-BERT) and multilingual GPT (mGPT) to compute these metrics
- Evaluated on eye-tracking reading speed data from 13 languages in the Multilingual Eye-tracking Corpus (MECO)
- Compared GAMM models with different metrics using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)  

Key Results:
- Both sentence surprisal and sentence relevance significantly predicted reading speed across languages
- Combining surprisal and relevance improved predictions compared to using either alone  
- Surprisal (m-BERT + chain rule) and relevance (m-BERT) were optimal methods
- Generalized well across diverse languages

Main Contributions:
- First proposed computational methods to model sentence processing difficulty 
- Showed sentence surprisal and relevance capture distinct effects on comprehension
- Demonstrated strong predictability of reading speed across languages
- Highlighted potential of combining language models with cognitive models to explain human language processing

In summary, this paper introduced innovative sentence-level metrics that effectively predict sentence processing difficulty across languages. The results highlight opportunities for using computational models to advance cognitive modeling of discourse comprehension.
