# [Cost-Efficient Subjective Task Annotation and Modeling through Few-Shot   Annotator Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In subjective NLP tasks, incorporating diverse perspectives from multiple annotators is crucial since their backgrounds influence the annotations. However, the annotation budget often limits the number of perspectives that can be included.
- Existing methods for modeling subjective tasks fail to maximize predictive performance for each annotator while minimizing the annotation budget.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage framework for annotation collection and modeling to address the budget constraints.
- Stage 1: Collect data from a small pool of annotators to build a multitask model that captures general patterns and differences among annotators. 
- Stage 2: Select a few informative samples from new annotators that highlight differences from general patterns learned in stage 1. Augment the stage 1 model with these samples to capture the new annotators' perspectives.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce a new dataset, Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus, with 2000 Reddit posts annotated by 24 people on moral sentiment.
- Demonstrate with experiments on two datasets that the framework improves state-of-the-art with only 25% of the budget.
- Show the framework yields more equitable models with reduced performance disparity among annotators.
- Analysis reveals sampling strategies that select balanced and highly disagreed samples work the best.
- Overall, the cost-efficient framework allows scaling diverse annotator perspectives under budget constraints.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel 2-stage approach for maximizing predictive performance and minimizing annotation budget in subjective NLP tasks. Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and equity in modeling annotator perspectives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework for subjective NLP tasks that builds a multitask model on a subset of annotators and then efficiently adapts it to new annotators' perspectives using only a few labeled examples per annotator, demonstrating improved performance and more equitable models across annotators compared to previous approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel two-stage framework for annotation collection and modeling in subjective NLP tasks. The key goals of this framework are:

1) To minimize the annotation budget required to model a fixed number of annotators, while maximizing the predictive performance for each annotator. This allows capturing more diverse perspectives under budget constraints. 

2) The framework has two stages - first, a small set of annotators are used to build a multitask model to learn common patterns. Second, the model is augmented to learn perspectives of new annotators using only a few strategically chosen samples per annotator.

3) The paper introduces a new dataset called the Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus with 2000 Reddit posts annotated by 24 people to enable research on detecting moral content, a relatively understudied subjective task.

4) Experiments on two datasets (including the new one) demonstrate that this framework can surpass state-of-the-art approaches using only 25-50% of the original annotation budget, while also reducing performance disparities across annotators.

In summary, the main contribution is a cost-efficient two-stage framework for subjective NLP tasks that can maximize performance and diversity of perspectives under budget constraints.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Subjective NLP tasks - The paper focuses on subjective natural language processing tasks where there is no single "ground truth" label and individual annotators can have different perspectives.

- Annotator perspectives - Capturing the unique, diverse viewpoints and backgrounds of different annotators is a major focus. The paper aims to model subjective tasks in a way that represents these varying annotator perspectives.

- Annotation budget - The budget for collecting annotation data from human labelers is a key constraint that limits the number of annotator perspectives that can be included. The paper tries to maximize diversity while minimizing budget.

- Multitask learning - A multitask learning model is used as a baseline that jointly models all annotators in the first stage. This captures common patterns.

- Few-shot learning - In the second stage, only a small number of examples are used to fine-tune the model to new annotators' viewpoints in a few-shot way.

- Sample selection strategies - Strategies for selecting the most useful few-shot examples to capture annotator differences are explored, like balanced sampling.

- Performance disparities - The paper analyzes differences in performance across annotators and aims to create more equitable models.

- Annotation collection frameworks - A two-stage annotation collection and modeling framework is proposed to efficiently capture subjective perspectives.

In summary, the key focus is on efficiently modeling subjective tasks and diverse annotator viewpoints under budget constraints.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework for annotation collection and modeling in subjective NLP tasks. Can you explain in detail the intuition and reasoning behind adopting a two-stage approach? What are the limitations of existing one-stage methods that motivated this design?

2. In the first stage, the paper relies on multitask learning using only a subset of annotators. What is the rationale behind not including all available annotators in this stage? How did the authors determine that only a small number of annotators are sufficient? 

3. The second stage involves collecting labels from new annotators on a small strategically selected set of samples. What are the different sample selection strategies explored in the paper? Can you analyze the trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance for each strategy?

4. Balanced sample selection is reported to be the most effective sampling strategy. However, obtaining balanced samples requires knowing the ground truth labels. How can this strategy be approximated when ground truth labels are not available for new annotators?

5. The paper introduces a new dataset called the Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus. What makes this an appropriate testbed for evaluating the proposed framework? What are some of the limitations of the dataset?

6. One of the objectives is to minimize the annotation budget. How is budget formally defined in the paper? Explain mathematically how budget gets reduced in the proposed two-stage approach compared to baseline methods.

7. The paper argues that the proposed method yields more equitable models. What metrics are used to quantify equity? Why is equity an important consideration in subjective tasks? How does the framework optimize for equity?

8. Analyze the mixed-effects model that investigates the relationship between agreement within the initial annotator set and performance on new annotators. What conclusions can you draw from this analysis?

9. From an ethical perspective, discuss the considerations in collecting and releasing datasets with subjective annotations attributed to individuals with diverse identities and backgrounds.

10. The paper focuses exclusively on text classification tasks. Do you think the framework can be extended to other subjective NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, toxicity detection etc.? Identify challenges in adapting the approach to new tasks.
