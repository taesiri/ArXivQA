# [Deep Network for Image Compressed Sensing Coding Using Local Structural   Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19111)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing image compressed sensing (CS) coding methods have two main challenges: 1) Random sampling matrices like Gaussian random matrix (GRM) have low measurement coding efficiency; 2) Optimization-based reconstruction methods have high complexity.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a new CNN-based image CS coding framework (CSCNet) with three modules:
  1. Local structural sampling: Learns a sampling matrix to produce highly correlated measurements for efficient coding. The matrix is highly sparse for hardware implementation.
  2. Measurement coding: Uses a third-party image codec like JPEG2000 or BPG to compress the measurements.
  3. Laplacian pyramid reconstruction: Reconstructs image from measurements using a convolutional pyramid network.

Main Contributions:
- Designed a learnable, hardware-friendly, local structural sampling matrix that produces correlated measurements.
- Integrated third-party image codecs into the framework instead of designing new coding tools.
- Proposed a convolutional Laplacian pyramid network for efficient progressive image reconstruction.
- Framework is trained end-to-end for joint optimization and better coding efficiency.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art CS coding methods in rate-distortion performance while maintaining fast speed.

In summary, the paper proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework for image CS coding, with novel designs for sampling matrix and reconstruction network. By leveraging existing image codecs, it achieves improved coding efficiency and flexibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a deep learning-based compressed sensing image coding framework using a local structural sampling matrix, measurement coding with a third-party codec, and a convolutional Laplacian pyramid reconstruction network.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1) A new CNN based image compressed sensing (CS) coding framework using local structural sampling is proposed, which includes three functional modules: local structural sampling, measurement coding and Laplacian pyramid reconstruction.

2) A learnable local structural sampling matrix with high sparsity is designed, which can be easily implemented in hardware for compressive imaging, and can generate highly correlated measurements for efficient measurement coding. 

3) A convolutional Laplacian pyramid network is developed to progressively reconstruct the target image from measurement domain to image domain.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What is the motivation behind proposing a local structural sampling matrix rather than using common random sampling matrices like Gaussian random matrix? How does local structural sampling enhance measurement coding efficiency?

2) How is the local structural sampling matrix designed to balance hardware implementation feasibility and optimizability during the training process? What constraints are introduced?  

3) Explain the positive normalization operation in detail and why it is needed after the localization operation on the sampling matrix.

4) What is the advantage of using a Laplacian pyramid reconstruction network over single-scale reconstruction networks? How does it help improve performance?

5) The quantization operator in existing codecs affects gradient backpropagation during end-to-end training. How is this issue handled? What approximations are made?

6) Analyze the complexity and efficiency of both the encoder and decoder parts of the proposed framework. How do they compare to optimization-based CS coding methods?

7) What correlations between measurements are exploited by using a third party image codec for measurement coding? How much performance gain is achieved over prediction-based measurement coding?

8) How suitable is the proposed method for hardware implementation? What modifications might be needed to deploy it on resource-constrained hardware?

9) Compare and contrast the proposed compressed sensing coding (CSC) framework with CS-based image coding (CSBC) methods. What are the tradeoffs?

10) The performance of the proposed method based on BPG lags behind BPG itself at high bitrates in terms of PSNR. What could be the potential reasons? How can this issue be addressed?
