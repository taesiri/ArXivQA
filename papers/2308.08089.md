# [DragNUWA: Fine-grained Control in Video Generation by Integrating Text,   Image, and Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08089)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is:How can we achieve fine-grained control in open-domain video generation by integrating text, image, and trajectory inputs?The key points are:- Most existing works focus on either text, image, or trajectory-based control for video generation. Using only one type of control is insufficient and leads to a lack of fine-grained controllability. - The authors argue that simultaneously incorporating text, image, and trajectory inputs is necessary to control videos from semantic, spatial, and temporal perspectives.- Current trajectory-based video generation models are limited to simple datasets like Human3.6M. The authors aim to tackle open-domain trajectory control to handle complex motions and camera movements.- To enable open-domain trajectory control, the paper proposes modeling trajectories using: (1) Trajectory Sampler for arbitrary trajectories, (2) Multiscale Fusion for different granularities, (3) Adaptive Training for consistency.In summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating text, image, and trajectory inputs can achieve fine-grained control in open-domain video generation, which existing single control approaches fail to accomplish. The key contribution is the simultaneous modeling of all three controls with a focus on advancing open-domain trajectory control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The proposal of DragNUWA, an end-to-end video generation model that incorporates text, image, and trajectory inputs for fine-grained control over video generation. 2. A focus on modeling trajectory control through three aspects:- A Trajectory Sampler (TS) to enable open-domain control of arbitrary trajectories.- A Multiscale Fusion (MF) approach to control trajectories at different granularities. - An Adaptive Training (AT) strategy to generate stable and consistent videos following trajectories.3. Experiments that validate the effectiveness of DragNUWA and demonstrate its capabilities for fine-grained control in open-domain video synthesis, including complex trajectory control and simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects and camera movements.In summary, the key contribution seems to be the DragNUWA model itself, which uniquely integrates text, image, and trajectory-based control while emphasizing trajectory modeling to achieve strong controllability over video generation from semantic, spatial, and temporal perspectives. The experiments then serve to demonstrate and validate these capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes DragNUWA, a video generation model that achieves fine-grained control over generated videos by concurrently conditioning on text, images, and trajectories, with a focus on modeling trajectories through a sampler to enable open-domain control, multiscale fusion for trajectory integration, and adaptive training for consistency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in controllable video generation:- It focuses on integrating text, image, and trajectory control simultaneously for fine-grained control. Most prior works have focused on only one or two types of control (e.g. text-to-video or image-to-video). Using all three allows controlling videos from semantic, spatial, and temporal perspectives.- It emphasizes modeling complex trajectory control, including curved trajectories, variable lengths, and multiple objects. Prior trajectory-based works were limited to simpler datasets like Human3.6M or basic object motions. The proposed techniques like the Trajectory Sampler and Multiscale Fusion aim to handle more complex open-domain trajectories.- It is based on diffusion models, whereas most prior controllable video generation has used GANs, VAEs, or autoregressive models. Diffusion has shown strong results for image generation, so applying it to video could be a promising direction.- It focuses on an end-to-end model trained directly on video caption datasets. Some other works have taken a cascaded approach with separate text, image, and video models. The end-to-end approach could allow better joint training.- The experiments are more comprehensive than most prior work, evaluating both trajectory and language control on diverse datasets. Many papers have been limited to narrow domains or motions.Overall, this paper pushes controllable video generation significantly forward in terms of control granularity, trajectory modeling, training methodology, and evaluation. If the techniques pan out, they could enable much more flexible and fine-grained control for practical video generation. The ideas like joint text-image-trajectory control and adaptive trajectory training could inspire more research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Exploring more fine-grained trajectory control, such as enabling control over acceleration/deceleration and rotation/spinning of objects. This would allow manipulating intricate object movements.- Extending trajectory control to 3D, enabling control over motion and camera viewpoints in 3D space. This is more challenging but could enable controllable video generation for VR/AR applications. - Incorporating physics-based simulation and reasoning to ensure generated object motions follow real-world physical constraints. This could improve motion realism.- Exploring trajectory control on videos with complex backgrounds, lighting, textures, etc. Current research primarily focuses on simple datasets. Evaluating on more complex videos could push progress.- Studying social dynamics modeling through trajectory control over multiple interacting agents. This could enable controlling complex multi-agent behaviors and interactions.- Integrating trajectory control with other modalities like audio to enable cross-modal controllability over both visual dynamics and sounds.- Applying controllable video generation with trajectory control to downstream applications like robotics, embodied AI, education, creative tools, etc. This could demonstrate benefits over less controllable models.In summary, the main future directions are enhancing trajectory control granularity, extending it to 3D and complex domains, incorporating physics and multi-agent modeling, integrating cross-modal control, and applying it to downstream tasks. Advancing research along these fronts could significantly advance controllable open-domain video generation.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes DragNUWA, a video generation model that allows for fine-grained control of generated videos through the use of text, image, and trajectory inputs. DragNUWA emphasizes modeling trajectory control, enabling open-domain dragging of objects to create complex motions and camera movements.

Experiments demonstrate that DragNUWA can generate high-quality, controllable videos by manipulating trajectory, text, and image inputs. For example, the model can generate videos with complex curved object trajectories, zooming camera movements, and introduce new objects based on text descriptions. The results showcase DragNUWA's ability to achieve stronger control over semantic, spatial, and temporal aspects of videos compared to previous methods.In summary, this paper introduces DragNUWA, a video generation model that achieves fine-grained control over generated video content by incorporating text, image, and trajectory inputs.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes DragNUWA, an end-to-end video generation model that can incorporate text, image, and trajectory inputs to achieve controllable video synthesis. The key innovation is the modeling of the trajectory input in three aspects: 1) A Trajectory Sampler (TS) that directly samples trajectories from open-domain video flows to enable control over arbitrary trajectories. 2) A Multiscale Fusion (MF) module that fuses the trajectory information with text and image features at multiple scales within a UNet architecture for granular control. 3) An Adaptive Training (AT) approach that first conditions on dense optical flow for stability and then trains on sparse trajectories for user-friendly control. Through the modeling of trajectories via TS, MF, and AT, along with fusion of text and image conditions, DragNUWA achieves fine-grained controllability over video generation from semantic, spatial, and temporal perspectives. Experiments demonstrate its superior trajectory control capabilities for complex motions and camera movements compared to prior arts.
