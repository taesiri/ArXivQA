# [Rhizomes to Load Balance Skewed In-Degree Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In vertex-centric graph processing, high in-degree vertices can cause load imbalance as all the incoming edges are localized to where the vertex resides. This can be a node in a distributed system or a core/tile in a many-core system.
- This in-degree imbalance degrades performance especially for graphs with highly skewed degree distributions.

Proposed Solution:  
- Apply the concept of "rhizome" to create multiple replicas of high in-degree vertices, called Rhizomatic Recursively Parallel Vertex Objects (RPVOs). 
- Allow incoming edges to be distributed across these rhizome RPVO replicas, thereby sharing the in-degree load.
- Rhizomes are allocated randomly on the chip to distribute load.
- Consistency between rhizomes is maintained using extra "propagate" messages.

Contributions:
- Novel application of the rhizome concept to vertex-centric graph processing to handle in-degree imbalance.
- For BFS traversal on a simulated many-core system, achieves avg speedups of 2.08x and 3.75x for 64x64 and 128x128 chip sizes.
- Shows rhizomes lower network contention and distribute it more evenly across the chip.
- Demonstrates improved strong scaling using rhizomes compared to a standard RPVO approach.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative "rhizome" based approach to distribute high in-degree vertices in graph processing to improve performance, especially for graphs with highly skewed degree distributions. Experiments demonstrate benefits in terms of reduced contention and improved scaling.
