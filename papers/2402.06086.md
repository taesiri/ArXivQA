# [Rhizomes to Load Balance Skewed In-Degree Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In vertex-centric graph processing, high in-degree vertices can cause load imbalance as all the incoming edges are localized to where the vertex resides. This can be a node in a distributed system or a core/tile in a many-core system.
- This in-degree imbalance degrades performance especially for graphs with highly skewed degree distributions.

Proposed Solution:  
- Apply the concept of "rhizome" to create multiple replicas of high in-degree vertices, called Rhizomatic Recursively Parallel Vertex Objects (RPVOs). 
- Allow incoming edges to be distributed across these rhizome RPVO replicas, thereby sharing the in-degree load.
- Rhizomes are allocated randomly on the chip to distribute load.
- Consistency between rhizomes is maintained using extra "propagate" messages.

Contributions:
- Novel application of the rhizome concept to vertex-centric graph processing to handle in-degree imbalance.
- For BFS traversal on a simulated many-core system, achieves avg speedups of 2.08x and 3.75x for 64x64 and 128x128 chip sizes.
- Shows rhizomes lower network contention and distribute it more evenly across the chip.
- Demonstrates improved strong scaling using rhizomes compared to a standard RPVO approach.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative "rhizome" based approach to distribute high in-degree vertices in graph processing to improve performance, especially for graphs with highly skewed degree distributions. Experiments demonstrate benefits in terms of reduced contention and improved scaling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using the concept of rhizomes, stems that grow horizontally and connect roots in botany, to construct multiple named vertex addresses in graphs to distribute the workload and network contention caused by highly skewed in-degree distributions in vertex-centric graph processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is:

Applying the concept of rhizomes to vertex-centric graph processing in order to distribute the in-degree load of vertices with large in-degree distribution. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes using rhizomatic recursively parallel vertex objects (RPVOs) to create multiple named vertex addresses for vertices with high in-degree. This allows spreading the in-degree load by having other vertices point to any of these named rhizome addresses.

2) Through simulations, the paper shows performance improvements from using rhizomes for breadth-first search on graphs with highly skewed in-degree distributions, especially for large chip sizes. For example, it reports geomean speedups of 2.08x and 3.75x for 64x64 and 128x128 chips compared to not using rhizomes.

3) The paper also demonstrates that rhizomes help lower and spread network-on-chip contention more evenly in addition to distributing compute workload.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating the concept of rhizomes for addressing in-degree load imbalance in vertex-centric graph processing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Rhizome - The concept borrowed from other disciplines to distribute in-degree load by creating multiple named vertex addresses. 

- Recursively Parallel Vertex Object (RPVO) - The tree structure used to distribute out-degree load of large out-degree vertices.

- In-degree load imbalance - The problem of some vertices having very large number of incoming edges, causing load imbalance.

- Message-driven vertex programs - The programming model used where vertices execute actions sent by neighbor vertices.

- Breadth-First Search (BFS) - The graph traversal algorithm used to evaluate the performance of rhizomes. 

- Speedup - The performance metric used to quantify improvements from using rhizomes.

- Strong scaling - Evaluating performance as chip size increases by keeping problem size fixed. 

- Contention - Time spent waiting when multiple messages try to access same router channel, increased by skewed in-degree.

So in summary, the key ideas relate to using rhizomes to distribute high in-degree load, evaluating this technique, and the concepts around asynchronous message-driven vertex-centric graph processing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions applying the concept of "rhizome" from other disciplines to graph processing. Can you expand more on what a rhizome means in those other contexts and how the key properties were adapted for this graph processing application?

2. The rhizomatic RPVO approach distributes in-degree load across multiple vertex copies. However, this introduces consistency issues. Can you elaborate on the consistency mechanisms that are used to keep the vertex copies synchronized? How much communication overhead does this introduce?

3. The paper uses a simple heuristic based on max in-degree and number of rhizomes to determine when to spawn new rhizome vertices. Could more advanced graph partitioning and load balancing methods be applied to make smarter rhizome creation decisions? What might be some approaches?

4. Random allocation is used to distribute the rhizomes across the compute cells of the architecture. What are some other allocation strategies that could be used instead of random? What might be the tradeoffs? 

5. How does the introduction of rhizomes impact routing and congestion on the network-on-chip? Are any special routing mechanisms needed to handle requests going to the rhizomes?

6. For applications like PageRank, the consistency mechanisms require a periodic all-reduce. How is this implemented efficiently over the architecture? Does the all-reduce become a scaling bottleneck at some point?

7. The experiments show very good strong scaling results for the architecture with rhizomes. What architectural factors are contributing most to the improved scaling? How might limits on these factors bound the scalability?

8. The paper focuses on a bulk synchronous execution model exemplified by BFS. How would the use of rhizomes change for an asynchronous execution model? What new challenges might arise?

9. Power and area costs are not analyzed when using rhizomes. What is the area and power overhead from having replicated vertex state in rhizomes? Under what conditions might this overhead outweigh the performance benefits?

10. The paper mentions the relationship between graph structure, architecture size, and utility of rhizomes. Can you characterize what types of graphs see the most and least benefit from employing rhizomes? Why?
