## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Micro-fractures in solar photovoltaic (PV) cells can lead to reduced power output and eventual failure. Manual inspection is time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, an automated system for detecting cell cracks using computer vision could help anticipate failures.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using deep learning models for automated crack detection in PV cells under different environments with varying computational constraints:
  - Environment A: Unconstrained environment where images are manually gathered and classified on a powerful computer. 
  - Environment B: Edge device on-site which captures and classifies images. Only classification result transmitted.
  - Environment C: Drone flying over solar farm, classifying cell images in real-time on an onboard microcontroller.

- Various datasets created from expert annotated images of functional and damaged mono- and polycrystalline PV cells. Models trained using transfer learning from ImageNet and fine-tuned.

- For each environment, optimized deep learning models identified after extensive experimentation considering accuracy and hardware metrics.

Key Contributions:
- Novel machine learning methodology to accommodate tradeoffs between transfer learning vs training small models from scratch.
- Automated crack detection system proposed leveraging emerging hardware like microcontrollers, edge devices and drones.
- Environment A: InceptionV3 model achieved 93% accuracy on multi-label dataset.
- Environment B: Quantized EfficientNetB0 retained 85% accuracy while small enough for edge devices.  
- Environment C: Custom VGG16-based CNN achieved 82% accuracy while being exportable to microcontrollers.

In summary, the authors demonstrate an end-to-end system for automated cell crack detection using optimized deep learning models tailored for environments with different computational constraints. Both transfer learning and new model development approaches are explored. The system could enable continuous inspection and early failure prediction in solar farms.
