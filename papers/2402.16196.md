# [Combining Machine Learning with Computational Fluid Dynamics using   OpenFOAM and SmartSim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Combining machine learning (ML) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is challenging when operating at scale due to difficulties with exchanging data, synchronizing computations, and using heterogeneous hardware efficiently. 

- The paper aims to address three main questions: (1) How to embed ML into CFD simulations like OpenFOAM; (2) What computing architectures allow efficient use of CPU and GPU resources; (3) What are some basic workflow patterns that can enable complex CFD+ML applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Use SmartSim library for workflow orchestration and Redis-based distributed in-memory database for scalable data exchange between CFD (OpenFOAM) and ML clients. 

- Adopt a loose coupling approach with separate CFD and ML executables connected via database, instead of tight integration. Enables modularity and deployment flexibility.

- Provide C++ API in OpenFOAM for interacting with SmartRedis database to simplify data transfer. Includes high-level services and generic methods.

- Demonstrate approach via 3 use cases: (1) Bayesian optimization for turbulence model tuning; (2) Streaming CFD data for online SVD; (3) Online training and inference of neural network for mesh motion.

Key Contributions:
- Architecture for scalable and efficient CFD+ML workflows using OpenFOAM, SmartSim and distributed in-memory computing. 

- Loosely coupled approach for modularity and flexible deployment on heterogeneous resources.

- Open-source integration of SmartRedis into OpenFOAM through new functionObject.

- Example implementations spanning optimization, dimensionality reduction and neural networks.

- Starting point for OpenFOAM community to build more advanced concurrent CFD+ML simulations.

In summary, the paper proposes a practical solution and reference implementations to lower barriers for developing complexworkflows that leverage machine learning within traditional high performance CFD codes like OpenFOAM.
