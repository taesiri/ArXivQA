# [PNAS-MOT: Multi-Modal Object Tracking with Pareto Neural Architecture   Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multiple object tracking (MOT) is critical for autonomous driving but faces challenges like high latency and unreliability of single sensors. 
- Existing MOT methods using deep neural networks become complex, causing high latency unsuitable for real-time applications.  
- Relying on a single sensor modality like camera or LiDAR also causes issues like mismatching and unreliability.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multi-modal MOT framework fusing both camera and LiDAR features to improve robustness.
- Employ a neural architecture search (NAS) method with Pareto optimization to search for efficient DNNs meeting latency constraints.
- Formulate a two-stage Pareto optimization scheme. Stage 1 searches architectures minimizing both tracking loss and latency loss. Stage 2 trains the model only on tracking loss.  
- Design a hardware latency model to estimate latency of architectures on various devices.
- Fuse features from both modalities using learned weights for robustness. Assign more weight to LiDAR when camera fails and vice versa.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a NAS framework to search for efficient DNNs for MOT meeting specified latency constraints.
- Achieve 89.59% MOT accuracy close to state-of-the-art but with latency below 80ms on edge devices.
- Demonstrate multi-modal fusion framework improving robustness over single modality approaches.
- Extensive experiments validate achieving high accuracy under tight latency constraints on various hardware.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in obtaining efficient and robust MOT performance leveraging NAS techniques and multi-modal fusion to address critical challenges of latency and reliability for autonomous driving systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a latency-constrained neural architecture search method for multi-modal object tracking that achieves high accuracy while maintaining low latency suitable for practical autonomous driving applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a constrained neural architecture search (NAS) method that searches for network architectures capable of completing the MOT task within a specified time limit. This is solved by a Pareto frontier searching algorithmic scheme, which finds a suitable latency-accuracy trade-off. 

2. It evaluates the proposed algorithm on the KITTI benchmark and achieves 89.59% accuracy close to state-of-the-art methods while keeping the latency below 80 milliseconds on different edge devices.

In summary, the key contribution is using NAS to search for efficient network architectures for multi-object tracking that can achieve high accuracy under strict latency constraints, demonstrating the capability to run in real-time on edge devices. This allows the tracking system to be deployed in practical autonomous driving scenarios.

The paper proposes a latency-constrained neural architecture search method for efficient multi-modal object tracking, aiming to achieve a good trade-off between tracking accuracy and inference latency. Key ideas include using Pareto optimization to search the architecture space, fusing image and LiDAR features in a weighted manner, and evaluating the method on the autonomous driving dataset KITTI for tasks like object detection and tracking that are critical for safe navigation. The constrained NAS approach allows the method to meet certain latency requirements crucial for real-time performance in autonomous driving systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization scheme with two alternating stages. Could you explain more about why this two-stage approach is superior to directly optimizing for both objectives simultaneously? What are the advantages of separating into two stages?

2. In the first stage of Pareto optimization, how exactly is the trade-off controlled between accuracy and latency when updating the architecture encoding α? What happens if you set λ to be very small vs very large? 

3. The paper mentions pruning low-weight operations from stage I when transitioning to stage II training. Could you explain the rationale behind pruning and why it is necessary? What criteria do you use to determine which operations to prune? 

4. What modifications were made to the DARTS search space to make it suitable for the MOT task? What operations were added or removed and why?

5. The ablation study compares three different search modes. Why is simultaneously searching both image and LiDAR branches (mode 2) superior to searching them individually? What are the advantages of joint architecture search?

6. How exactly is the hardware latency function constructed and incorporated into the loss? What parameters of each operation are accounted for and how is the latency dictionary formed? 

7. The paper proposes a weighted feature fusion mechanism. Could you explain how the weights are determined for fusing image vs LiDAR features? When will more emphasis be placed on one modality over the other?

8. What modifications were made to the adjacency estimator from previous work? How did you adapt it to leverage both fused and correlation features for improved tracking?

9. The paper uses linear programming for data association. What are the advantages of formulating MOT as a min-cost flow problem compared to other association techniques?

10. The framework splits fused features into tracklet vs detection features before computing correlations. Why is this split necessary? What is the intuition behind computing correlations this way?
