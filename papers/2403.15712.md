# [PNAS-MOT: Multi-Modal Object Tracking with Pareto Neural Architecture   Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multiple object tracking (MOT) is critical for autonomous driving but faces challenges like high latency and unreliability of single sensors. 
- Existing MOT methods using deep neural networks become complex, causing high latency unsuitable for real-time applications.  
- Relying on a single sensor modality like camera or LiDAR also causes issues like mismatching and unreliability.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multi-modal MOT framework fusing both camera and LiDAR features to improve robustness.
- Employ a neural architecture search (NAS) method with Pareto optimization to search for efficient DNNs meeting latency constraints.
- Formulate a two-stage Pareto optimization scheme. Stage 1 searches architectures minimizing both tracking loss and latency loss. Stage 2 trains the model only on tracking loss.  
- Design a hardware latency model to estimate latency of architectures on various devices.
- Fuse features from both modalities using learned weights for robustness. Assign more weight to LiDAR when camera fails and vice versa.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a NAS framework to search for efficient DNNs for MOT meeting specified latency constraints.
- Achieve 89.59% MOT accuracy close to state-of-the-art but with latency below 80ms on edge devices.
- Demonstrate multi-modal fusion framework improving robustness over single modality approaches.
- Extensive experiments validate achieving high accuracy under tight latency constraints on various hardware.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in obtaining efficient and robust MOT performance leveraging NAS techniques and multi-modal fusion to address critical challenges of latency and reliability for autonomous driving systems.
