# [Context-Based Trit-Plane Coding for Progressive Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05715)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can context models be developed and utilized to enable deep progressive image compression algorithms to achieve improved rate-distortion performance? The key points are:- Existing deep image codecs cannot support progressive compression well, as they rely on autoregressive context models that assume encoder and decoder latent representations are synchronized. - The authors propose novel context models - context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) - that exploit available information to respectively reduce bitrate and distortion in a progressive setting.- CRR refines trit probability estimates before entropy coding to reduce bitrate. It uses already coded trit planes, entropy parameters, and expected latent values as context. - CDR refines partial latent representations after entropy decoding to reduce distortion. It uses entropy parameters as context.- A decoder retraining scheme further adapts the decoder to the refined latent representations from CDR.- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for progressive image compression, significantly outperforming prior progressive codecs.In summary, the key hypothesis is that specially designed context models can enable deep progressive image compression to achieve improved rate-distortion tradeoffs compared to context-free progressive codecs. The proposed CRR and CDR modules validate this hypothesis.
