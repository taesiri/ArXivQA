# [Context-Based Trit-Plane Coding for Progressive Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05715)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can context models be developed and utilized to enable deep progressive image compression algorithms to achieve improved rate-distortion performance? The key points are:- Existing deep image codecs cannot support progressive compression well, as they rely on autoregressive context models that assume encoder and decoder latent representations are synchronized. - The authors propose novel context models - context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) - that exploit available information to respectively reduce bitrate and distortion in a progressive setting.- CRR refines trit probability estimates before entropy coding to reduce bitrate. It uses already coded trit planes, entropy parameters, and expected latent values as context. - CDR refines partial latent representations after entropy decoding to reduce distortion. It uses entropy parameters as context.- A decoder retraining scheme further adapts the decoder to the refined latent representations from CDR.- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for progressive image compression, significantly outperforming prior progressive codecs.In summary, the key hypothesis is that specially designed context models can enable deep progressive image compression to achieve improved rate-distortion tradeoffs compared to context-free progressive codecs. The proposed CRR and CDR modules validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new deep learning-based method for progressive image compression called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC). The key contributions are:- It develops two novel context models called context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) that improve compression performance by exploiting dependencies between elements in the latent representation. - CRR reduces bitrate by refining the probability distribution of latent elements before entropy coding, using already encoded trit-planes as context. - CDR reduces distortion by refining the decoded latent representation after entropy decoding, using the mean and standard deviation as context.- It proposes a decoder retraining scheme to further improve rate-distortion performance. The decoder is adapted to the refined latent representations from CDR.- Experiments show CTC significantly outperforms prior progressive compression methods like nested quantization and baseline trit-plane coding. For example, it achieves -14.84% lower BD-rate on Kodak compared to baseline trit-plane coding.In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of context models CRR and CDR that exploit dependencies in the latent space to improve compression, along with decoder retraining. This allows CTC to achieve state-of-the-art performance for deep progressive image compression.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for progressive image compression called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC) that exploits context models before and after entropy coding to reduce bitrates and distortions significantly.In slightly more detail:- The paper builds on prior work on trit-plane coding for deep progressive image compression. - It introduces two new context modules - context-based rate reduction (CRR) before entropy coding to reduce bitrates, and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) after entropy coding to reduce distortions.- CRR and CDR exploit already decoded information as contexts to refine the compression process, unlike prior autoregressive context models that cannot be used for progressive coding.- A decoder retraining scheme is also proposed to further boost rate-distortion performance.- Experiments show CTC provides significant bitrate savings compared to prior art in progressive image compression, while increasing complexity only marginally.In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of context models that work with progressive image compression to improve rate-distortion performance.
