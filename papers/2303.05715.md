# [Context-Based Trit-Plane Coding for Progressive Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05715)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can context models be developed and utilized to enable deep progressive image compression algorithms to achieve improved rate-distortion performance? 

The key points are:

- Existing deep image codecs cannot support progressive compression well, as they rely on autoregressive context models that assume encoder and decoder latent representations are synchronized. 

- The authors propose novel context models - context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) - that exploit available information to respectively reduce bitrate and distortion in a progressive setting.

- CRR refines trit probability estimates before entropy coding to reduce bitrate. It uses already coded trit planes, entropy parameters, and expected latent values as context. 

- CDR refines partial latent representations after entropy decoding to reduce distortion. It uses entropy parameters as context.

- A decoder retraining scheme further adapts the decoder to the refined latent representations from CDR.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for progressive image compression, significantly outperforming prior progressive codecs.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that specially designed context models can enable deep progressive image compression to achieve improved rate-distortion tradeoffs compared to context-free progressive codecs. The proposed CRR and CDR modules validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new deep learning-based method for progressive image compression called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC). The key contributions are:

- It develops two novel context models called context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) that improve compression performance by exploiting dependencies between elements in the latent representation. 

- CRR reduces bitrate by refining the probability distribution of latent elements before entropy coding, using already encoded trit-planes as context. 

- CDR reduces distortion by refining the decoded latent representation after entropy decoding, using the mean and standard deviation as context.

- It proposes a decoder retraining scheme to further improve rate-distortion performance. The decoder is adapted to the refined latent representations from CDR.

- Experiments show CTC significantly outperforms prior progressive compression methods like nested quantization and baseline trit-plane coding. For example, it achieves -14.84% lower BD-rate on Kodak compared to baseline trit-plane coding.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of context models CRR and CDR that exploit dependencies in the latent space to improve compression, along with decoder retraining. This allows CTC to achieve state-of-the-art performance for deep progressive image compression.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for progressive image compression called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC) that exploits context models before and after entropy coding to reduce bitrates and distortions significantly.

In slightly more detail:

- The paper builds on prior work on trit-plane coding for deep progressive image compression. 

- It introduces two new context modules - context-based rate reduction (CRR) before entropy coding to reduce bitrates, and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) after entropy coding to reduce distortions.

- CRR and CDR exploit already decoded information as contexts to refine the compression process, unlike prior autoregressive context models that cannot be used for progressive coding.

- A decoder retraining scheme is also proposed to further boost rate-distortion performance.

- Experiments show CTC provides significant bitrate savings compared to prior art in progressive image compression, while increasing complexity only marginally.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of context models that work with progressive image compression to improve rate-distortion performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in deep learning-based image compression:

- This paper introduces novel context models called CRR (context-based rate reduction) and CDR (context-based distortion reduction) for progressive image compression. Most prior deep learning image codecs focused on fixed-rate compression and did not support progressive coding well. The proposed context models allow the use of partially reconstructed latent representations to reduce rate and distortion in a progressive manner. This is a unique contribution not seen in other works.

- The paper builds on top of the trit-plane coding framework introduced in the DPICT paper from CVPR 2022. It shows how context models can be integrated effectively into the trit-plane coding pipeline to boost performance. Other learning-based progressive codecs like nested quantization and recurrent networks did not demonstrate such levels of compression efficiency.

- For fixed-rate image compression, this paper presents competitive rate-distortion results on par with state-of-the-art methods like Cheng 2020, He 2021, etc. So the proposed CTC algorithm with context models matches top fixed-rate codecs while additionally providing progressive coding capability.

- The proposed decoder retraining scheme to adapt to refined latent tensors is simple but effective. Many prior works did not explore decoder retraining for progressive reconstruction.

- The complexity of the context models CRR and CDR is analyzed. They provide significant gains without heavily increasing encoding/decoding times compared to prior context models like Minnen 2018.

Overall, the paper makes several notable contributions in the field of deep learning-based image compression. The novel context models and decoder retraining strategy enable previous trit-plane coding to match/exceed state-of-the-art fixed-rate codecs while also efficiently supporting progressive decoding. The work represents an advance in progressive compression using deep neural networks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

1. End-to-end training of the full system: The authors note that currently the main network, context modules, and decoder are trained sequentially due to the non-differentiable slicing and reconstruction operations. Developing differentiable approximations for these modules could allow end-to-end training and potentially further improve performance. 

2. Extending the context models: The proposed context-based rate and distortion reduction modules could potentially be extended, for example by exploring more sophisticated network architectures or additional context information. This could lead to further gains.

3. Progressive compression for other types of data: The principles behind the proposed method could potentially be applied to progressive compression of other data types beyond images, such as video, audio, 3D graphics, etc. 

4. Hardware acceleration: The authors note that their method has low computational complexity, but specialized hardware accelerators could help enable real-time progressive compression and decompression.

5. Rate control: The ability to accurately control the output bitrate is important for practical compression systems. Exploring rate control mechanisms tailored for the proposed progressive compression algorithm could be useful.

In summary, the main future directions mentioned are: 1) end-to-end training, 2) extensions to the context models, 3) application to other data types, 4) hardware acceleration, and 5) rate control techniques. The authors' Progressive compression framework seems promising, and enhancing it in these directions could make the approach even more effective and applicable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new deep learning based algorithm for progressive image compression called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC). It builds on prior work in trit-plane coding, which enables scalable compression by representing latent image features as ternary values that can be decoded progressively from most to least significant bits. The key innovations in CTC are the addition of two context models, context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR), which exploit spatial correlations to predict trit probabilities and refine decoded latents. Specifically, CRR uses already decoded trits and hyperprior parameters to refine trit probability estimates before entropy coding, reducing bitrate. CDR refines the decoded latent after entropy decoding to reduce distortion. Experiments show CTC significantly outperforms prior progressive codecs, achieving over 14% bitrate savings on benchmark datasets. The improved RD performance comes with only a small increase in complexity due to the efficient convolutional architecture of the context models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new deep learning based method for progressive image compression called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC). CTC builds on prior work in trit-plane coding, which enables fine granular scalability by representing latent image features as trits (ternary digits) that can be decoded progressively from most to least significant. The key innovations in CTC are two context models called context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR). CRR uses already decoded information as context to more accurately estimate the probabilities of trits and thus encode the trit-planes more compactly. CDR uses context after decoding trit-planes to refine the partial latent representation and reduce distortion in the reconstructed image. Experiments demonstrate that CTC significantly outperforms prior progressive codecs. For example, on the Kodak lossless dataset, CTC achieves 14.84% lower BD-rate compared to the state-of-the-art trit-plane coding method. The gains mainly come from the proposed context models CRR and CDR, which provide efficient ways to exploit dependencies in the latent space to reduce rate and distortion respectively.

In summary, this paper improves progressive image compression using novel context models. CRR leverages context before entropy coding to reduce rate. CDR leverages context after partial decoding to reduce distortion. Together these innovations provide substantial gains over prior progressive codecs and enable high quality reconstruction across a wide range of bitrates from a single compressed representation. The proposed CTC demonstrates the advantage of deep learning based compression methods that learn to efficiently exploit statistical dependencies, in this case through context, for the challenging progressive coding problem.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a context-based trit-plane coding (CTC) algorithm for progressive image compression. The key ideas are:

1. It develops two context models called context-based rate reduction (CRR) and context-based distortion reduction (CDR) modules. CRR is used before entropy coding to refine the probability estimates of trit symbols and reduce bitrate. CDR is used after entropy decoding to refine the partially reconstructed latent tensor and improve image quality. 

2. CRR exploits the more significant trits, hyperprior parameters, and expected trit values as contexts to predict each trit plane's probabilities more accurately. CDR uses the hyperprior parameters as context to regress the quantization error in the partial latent tensor.

3. It retrains the decoder to adapt it to the refined latent tensors by CDR and improve rate-distortion performance.

4. Experiments show CTC significantly outperforms prior arts in progressive image compression. The context models improve performance while increasing complexity marginally.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of context models in progressive image compression, which previous works lacked. CRR reduces bitrate and CDR reduces distortion by exploiting context effectively.
