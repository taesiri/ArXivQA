# [SPML: A DSL for Defending Language Models Against Prompt Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11755)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly used to power chatbots via system prompts. However, once deployed, these chatbots are vulnerable to attacks from malicious users attempting to make them perform unintended and potentially unethical tasks.  
- Prior work has focused narrowly on extracting passwords or system prompts. Practical methods to secure application-specific chatbots in real world remain unexplored.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces the System Prompt Meta Language (SPML), a domain-specific language for writing system prompts and monitoring user inputs. 
- SPML allows creating well-structured chatbot definitions with programming constructs instead of ambiguous natural language.
- At runtime, SPML converts prompts and user inputs into an intermediate representation to compare and detect attacks. Any unsafe inputs are blocked before reaching the LLM.

Key Contributions:
- SPML meta language for writing and securing chatbot system prompts
- A dataset with 1871 system prompts and 20K labeled user inputs for evaluation
- Empirical analysis showing SPML outperforms LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, LaMDA in identifying adversarial user inputs
- Case studies demonstrating how SPML can monitor inputs and prevent attacks on chatbots  

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in securing LLM-based chatbots against prompt injection attacks using a specialized prompt language SPML and an evaluation benchmark. The results showcase SPML's effectiveness over existing general purpose LLMs in identifying and blocking adversarial inputs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces SPML, a prompt security language for detecting attacker inputs to language model chatbots, and presents a novel benchmark with system prompts across diverse domains and corresponding attack prompts for evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of SPML (System Prompt Meta Language), a domain-specific language for writing and monitoring system prompts for LLM-based chatbots. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) SPML allows creating well-written and maintainable chatbot definitions by providing a programming language interface instead of plain natural language. This overcomes challenges like ambiguity and complexity in crafting detailed prompts.

2) SPML can monitor incoming user inputs and detect potential prompt injection attacks before reaching the LLM backbone. It does this by comparing the user input against the system prompt written in SPML, ensuring the user stays within the chatbot's defined scope.

3) The paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset comprising 1871 system prompts and over 20k labeled user inputs (safe and malicious) to evaluate SPML's attack detection abilities.

4) Experiments demonstrate SPML's proficiency in understanding attacker prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA. The results also highlight SPML's ability to handle multi-layered attacks.

In summary, the paper proposes a specialized language SPML for writing and securing chatbot prompts, along with a dataset to facilitate prompt injection attack research. The results validate SPML's efficacy as a monitoring system for safeguarding LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a domain-specific language called SPML for writing system prompts. What are some key benefits of using a DSL compared to writing prompts directly in natural language? How does it help with prompt injection monitoring?

2. The intermediate representation (IR) plays an important role in SPML. What specific purpose does the IR serve? Why generate an IR instead of directly comparing the system prompt and user input? 

3. SPML uses a type system to catch inconsistencies and ambiguities during prompt development. Can you explain some of the key types supported and how the type checker works using a language model?

4. When monitoring for prompt injection attacks, SPML first generates an "IR skeleton". What is this skeleton, how is it generated, and what role does it play in detecting attacks? 

5. The user input is used to "fill" the IR skeleton in SPML's pipeline. Explain this filling process and how it enables detecting if the user input aims to modify properties of the original prompt.

6. Once the IR skeleton is filled with user input, it undergoes a safety analysis. Walk through this analysis process and how it determines if a prompt injection attack was attempted.

7. The benchmark dataset introduced covers diverse chatbot use cases with labeled prompts. Discuss the methodology and techniques used for generating quality system prompts and corresponding safe, unsafe, and malicious user inputs. 

8. Analyze the results comparing SPML with state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Why does SPML outperform them in detecting attacks in certain cases? What explanations are provided?

9. This paper argues existing LLMs are not explicitly designed for handling attacks. Do you agree with this assessment based on the empirical analysis? What evidence supports or contradicts this claim? 

10. While effective, SPML is not foolproof in catching all malicious inputs. Discuss its limitations and additional protections that would need to be put in place for more robust security.
