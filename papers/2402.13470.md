# [How Important is Domain Specificity in Language Models and Instruction   Finetuning for Biomedical Relation Extraction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cutting edge NLP techniques like generative language models (LMs) and instruction finetuning are being adapted from general domain to biomedical domain in hopes of improving performance on tasks like biomedical relation extraction (RE). 
- But training biomedical-specific LMs requires substantial effort and cost. So it's important to evaluate if they provide benefits over general domain models. 

Questions:
- Do LMs trained on biomedical text outperform general domain LMs for biomedical RE? 
- Do biomedical instruction finetuned models outperform base models and general instruction finetuned models?
- Do the answers differ in few-shot vs fully finetuned settings?

Methods:
- Compare multiple biomedical LMs (BioGPT, SciFive) to equivalent general domain LMs (GPT-2, T5) on 4 biomedical RE datasets, in full finetuning and few-shot contexts.
- Also compare instruction finetuned models (In-BoxBART, Flan-T5) to their base versions.
- Use natural language templates to formulate RE for generative finetuning and evaluation.

Results:
- Surprisingly, general domain LMs usually outperformed biomedical LMs in both full finetuning and few-shot contexts.  
- Small-scale biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance similarly to large-scale general domain instruction finetuning.

Conclusions:
- Training biomedical LMs from scratch may not be that beneficial over using general domain LMs.  
- But biomedical instruction finetuning is promising to improve biomedical RE with general domain LMs.
- More research needed on biomedical instruction finetuning and evaluating other biomedical tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

In experiments on biomedical relation extraction tasks, general-domain language models typically outperformed biomedical-domain models, however biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance to a similar degree as general instruction finetuning despite using orders of magnitude less instruction data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an investigation into the value of domain-specific language models and instruction finetuning for the biomedical relation extraction task. Specifically, the paper tests two main questions:

1) Do generative language models pretrained on biomedical text (PubMed abstracts) outperform models pretrained on general domain text? 

2) How do biomedical instruction finetuned models compare to models finetuned on general domain instructions or just pretrained without finetuning?

The paper tests these questions across four biomedical relation extraction datasets using a variety of open biomedical and general domain language models. The main findings are:

- General domain models typically outperformed biomedical domain models, contrary to expectations. This held in both full finetuning and few-shot settings.

- Biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance to a similar degree as general instruction finetuning, despite having orders of magnitude fewer instructions. 

The paper concludes that it may be more effective to focus research efforts on larger-scale biomedical instruction finetuning of general language models rather than building domain-specific biomedical models. The findings suggest domain specificity is less important than scale of finetuning data for the biomedical relation extraction task.

The paper investigates the value of domain-specific biomedical language models and instruction finetuning for the key biomedical natural language processing task of relation extraction. It compares the performance of biomedical and general domain models, as well as base and instruction finetuned models, on biomedical RE datasets. The key research questions focus on whether biomedical LMs outperform general domain LMs, and whether instruction finetuning helps, especially in the few-shot learning setting. Overall, the paper provides an assessment of the need for domain specificity in language models for biomedical relation extraction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares biomedical domain language models to general domain language models for relation extraction. What are some potential reasons why the general domain models performed better in most cases?

2. The paper found that decoder-only models like BioGPT performed much worse than encoder-decoder models for relation extraction. Why might this be the case? What are some disadvantages of using a decoder-only model for this task?

3. The paper proposes further research into biomedical instruction finetuning of general domain language models. What are some potential challenges in creating a large-scale biomedical instruction dataset? How could those challenges be addressed? 

4. The biomedical instruction finetuned model In-BoxBART showed strong few-shot performance despite having far less instruction data than the general domain models. Why might this be the case? What factors allow small-scale biomedical instruction finetuning to be effective?

5. The paper argues biomedical domain language models may learn inferior linguistic representations due to the narrower distribution of text. Do you agree? Why or why not? What evidence supports or contradicts this claim?

6. For the CDR dataset, the biomedical instruction finetuned In-BoxBART was trained on a related named entity recognition task. To what extent could this explain its strong CDR performance? How would you control for this potential confound?  

7. The paper speculates on why biomedical language models underperformed for relation extraction. What experiments could be done to further test each hypothesized reason (quantity of pretraining data, inferior linguistic representations)?

8. How well do you expect the paper's conclusions on domain specificity to generalize to other biomedical NLP tasks besides relation extraction? What factors determine whether domain-specific or general models will perform best?

9. The paper argues decoder-only models may be less suited for complex language generation tasks like relation extraction. Do you agree? In what scenarios might decoder-only models outperform encoder-decoder models in generation?

10. What other model architectures besides encoder-decoder and decoder-only should be explored for biomedical text generation? Would multitask models combining encoding and generation be beneficial? Why or why not?
