# [How Important is Domain Specificity in Language Models and Instruction   Finetuning for Biomedical Relation Extraction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cutting edge NLP techniques like generative language models (LMs) and instruction finetuning are being adapted from general domain to biomedical domain in hopes of improving performance on tasks like biomedical relation extraction (RE). 
- But training biomedical-specific LMs requires substantial effort and cost. So it's important to evaluate if they provide benefits over general domain models. 

Questions:
- Do LMs trained on biomedical text outperform general domain LMs for biomedical RE? 
- Do biomedical instruction finetuned models outperform base models and general instruction finetuned models?
- Do the answers differ in few-shot vs fully finetuned settings?

Methods:
- Compare multiple biomedical LMs (BioGPT, SciFive) to equivalent general domain LMs (GPT-2, T5) on 4 biomedical RE datasets, in full finetuning and few-shot contexts.
- Also compare instruction finetuned models (In-BoxBART, Flan-T5) to their base versions.
- Use natural language templates to formulate RE for generative finetuning and evaluation.

Results:
- Surprisingly, general domain LMs usually outperformed biomedical LMs in both full finetuning and few-shot contexts.  
- Small-scale biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance similarly to large-scale general domain instruction finetuning.

Conclusions:
- Training biomedical LMs from scratch may not be that beneficial over using general domain LMs.  
- But biomedical instruction finetuning is promising to improve biomedical RE with general domain LMs.
- More research needed on biomedical instruction finetuning and evaluating other biomedical tasks.
