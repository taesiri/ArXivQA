# [Zero-Shot Video Question Answering with Procedural Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Procedural Video Querying (ProViQ) for answering questions about videos using procedural reasoning. The key idea is to have a large language model generate short Python programs that break down the question into a sequence of steps, each calling a different visual module to solve. 

The problem being addressed is video question answering, especially in the zero-shot setting where there is no training data available from the target distribution. Existing methods typically pretrain on large unlabeled video datasets then finetune, but still generalize poorly. More recent works use web-scale supervision from captions or transcripts, but cannot perform explicit step-by-step reasoning.

The proposed solution, ProViQ, provides the language model with an API of visual modules at prompting time, such as functions for object detection, image QA, video retrieval, tracking etc. Given an input question and video, it generates a program that calls these modules in a logical order to decompose and solve the question, mimicking human reasoning. The modular architecture allows easy incorporation of new capabilities and model interpretations. 

The main contributions are:
(1) The ProViQ method to procedurally reason about and answer video questions through generated programs.
(2) Achieving SOTA results on multiple video QA benchmarks, improving accuracy by over 25% in some cases, without any training.
(3) Demonstrating additional capabilities like grounded tracking and query-based video editing enabled by the modular framework.

In conclusion, ProViQ sets a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot video QA through programmatic reasoning. The accuracy improvements and flexible framework highlight the strengths of this modular procedural approach to video understanding.
