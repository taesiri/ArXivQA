# [Zero-Shot Video Question Answering with Procedural Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Procedural Video Querying (ProViQ) for answering questions about videos using procedural reasoning. The key idea is to have a large language model generate short Python programs that break down the question into a sequence of steps, each calling a different visual module to solve. 

The problem being addressed is video question answering, especially in the zero-shot setting where there is no training data available from the target distribution. Existing methods typically pretrain on large unlabeled video datasets then finetune, but still generalize poorly. More recent works use web-scale supervision from captions or transcripts, but cannot perform explicit step-by-step reasoning.

The proposed solution, ProViQ, provides the language model with an API of visual modules at prompting time, such as functions for object detection, image QA, video retrieval, tracking etc. Given an input question and video, it generates a program that calls these modules in a logical order to decompose and solve the question, mimicking human reasoning. The modular architecture allows easy incorporation of new capabilities and model interpretations. 

The main contributions are:
(1) The ProViQ method to procedurally reason about and answer video questions through generated programs.
(2) Achieving SOTA results on multiple video QA benchmarks, improving accuracy by over 25% in some cases, without any training.
(3) Demonstrating additional capabilities like grounded tracking and query-based video editing enabled by the modular framework.

In conclusion, ProViQ sets a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot video QA through programmatic reasoning. The accuracy improvements and flexible framework highlight the strengths of this modular procedural approach to video understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ProViQ, a method that uses large language models to generate procedural Python programs composed of visual modules to answer zero-shot video questions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks without any training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting ProViQ, a method to procedurally reason about and answer zero-shot video queries through generated Python programs.

2. Showing ProViQ's flexibility for tasks beyond question answering, such as query-based multi-object tracking or video editing. 

3. Achieving large accuracy improvements on a wide range of video QA benchmarks, up to 25% on both open-ended and multiple-choice benchmarks, without any additional training. ProViQ is even competitive with supervised methods on some datasets.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing ProViQ, a modular and interpretable method for zero-shot video question answering and other video tasks, which obtains state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of benchmarks.

The paper proposes ProViQ, a method to procedurally reason about and answer zero-shot video queries through generated Python programs. It uses a large language model to generate programs that decompose questions into sequences of visual subtasks/modules like object detection, video retrieval, tracking etc. The modular framework enables capabilities beyond QA like tracking and video editing. Experiments show large improvements on diverse VQA datasets by flexibly composing these visual modules, without needing extra training. So procedural reasoning, modularity, code generation and zero-shot learning are core ideas.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a large language model to generate Python programs that can procedurally reason about videos. What are some of the key challenges in getting the language model to generate valid and useful programs compared to simpler approaches like end-to-end deep learning models?

2. The paper highlights interpretability as one of the benefits of the procedural reasoning approach. In what ways is the method more interpretable than end-to-end models? Can you provide some examples of how errors could be attributed to specific parts of the generated program?

3. One of the video modules provided in the API is a long video summarization module. What are some of the key ideas behind how this module works? What are some limitations of this approach for generalizing to diverse types of video content?

4. The method seems to achieve especially strong performance improvements on the EgoSchema benchmark for long video understanding. What aspects of the approach make it well suited for this task compared to end-to-end models?

5. Could the procedural reasoning approach used in this paper be applied to other vision tasks beyond video question answering? What are some examples of other applications where such an approach could be beneficial?

6. The error analysis indicates that failures are often attributed to incorrect program generation rather than failures of the visual modules. What could be done to improve the reliability of the program generation component?

7. How suitable do you think this method would be for interactive video question answering, where a user asks followup questions about the same video? What modifications might be needed to support such conversational QA abilities?

8. The method uses several pre-trained visual modules focused on different capabilities like object detection and video captioning. What are the tradeoffs in relying on these fixed modules versus having end-to-end trainable components?

9. The results show significant improvements on multiple video QA benchmarks. But what types of video content or questions do you think would still pose challenges for this method?

10. The paper demonstrates additional capabilities like grounded tracking and video editing using the same procedural reasoning approach. What underlying commonalities make the method applicable to such diverse video manipulation tasks?
