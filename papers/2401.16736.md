# [Engineering A Large Language Model From Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional recurrent neural networks struggle to model long-range dependencies in sequential data and have difficulties with parallelization. This limits their effectiveness for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called "Atinuke" which is based on the Transformer architecture. Atinuke aims to optimize model dimensions and training strategies to achieve state-of-the-art NLP performance without prohibitive computational costs.

Key Innovations in Atinuke:
- Employs self-attention mechanisms to effectively process sequential data by drawing meaningful connections between input and output. This alleviates issues with long-range dependencies.
- Careful tuning of key hyperparameters like number of heads in multi-head attention, hidden layer dimensions, depth of the network, and dropout regularization. This maximizes model capacity whilst maintaining computational efficiency.
- Positional encodings are used to inject information about token order in the sequences, allowing the model to interpret sequence order. 
- Mathematical operations like softmax, embeddings and sinusoidal functions enable nuanced handling of textual, acoustic and visual signals.

Results:
- Atinuke achieves state-of-the-art results on NLP tasks like SQuAD, GLUE, Coref, SNLI and SRL. For example, it improves SQuAD performance over previous SOTA by 0.7% relatively.
- The tuned model dimensions contribute to more effective learning of language nuances.
- Output shape confirms ability to handle varied sequence lengths.

Conclusion:
- Atinuke sets new standards for machine comprehension by enhancing attention mechanisms and optimizing model efficiency. This balance of computational load and model depth makes Atinuke well-suited for both academic and commercial NLP applications.
