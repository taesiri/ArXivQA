# [Compositional Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08292)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Providing a categorical framework for reasoning about compositionality in deep learning architectures. The paper translates concepts like neural network architectures, datasets, parameter-function maps, etc into the language of category theory. 

2. Using this categorical framework to show that optimization can be done in the functor space between two fixed categories, rather than just in the function space between two sets. This allows for structured learning of concepts and relationships using gradient descent.

3. Outlining a connection between this categorical deep learning formulation and categorical databases/data migration. There are similarities in how they specify categorical schemas, functor categories of instances, and notions of data integrity/path equivalences. 

4. Using the category theory perspective to conceive a novel neural network architecture for learning to insert/delete objects in images using unpaired data. The "product task" setup imposes high-level path equivalence relations that provide a useful training signal.

5. Testing this neural network architecture on 3 datasets - circles, CelebA faces, and StyleGAN latent vectors. The experiments demonstrate promising results for the approach, especially on the first two real image datasets.

So in summary, the main hypotheses appear to be:

- Category theory provides a useful framework for compositionality in deep learning.

- Optimization can be done in functor spaces guided by categorical notions. 

- Path equivalences are a useful inductive bias for tasks like object insertion/deletion.

The experiments then provide evidence to support the viability of these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the main contribution:

The paper lays out the beginnings of a formal compositional framework for reasoning about modern neural network architectures using category theory. The key contributions are:

- Generalizing the construction of "Para" from prior work to allow compositional reasoning about parametrized neural network components. 

- Formalizing neural network architectures, datasets, embeddings, etc. categorically, showing that optimization can be done in the functor space between categories rather than just function spaces.

- Outlining a correspondence between this categorical deep learning formulation and categorical databases.

- Using the framework to conceive a novel neural network architecture for learning to insert and delete objects in images with unpaired data. Promising experimental results are demonstrated on three datasets.

In summary, the paper provides a principled categorical perspective on neural network components and training. This allows complex neural network systems to be reasoned about compositionally. The framework is applied to develop a new architecture and task for semantic image manipulation using unpaired data. Overall, it aims to bridge category theory and deep learning in a practically useful way.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of compositional deep learning:

- The use of category theory to formulate deep learning architectures and training procedures is novel. Most prior work in this area does not use category theory and is focused more on empirical results. This paper provides a new perspective and theoretical framework.

- Translating concepts like neural network architectures, datasets, parameter-function maps, etc into categorical language is an interesting approach not taken by other papers. This allows viewing optimization in the functor space between categories rather than function spaces.

- The comparison to categorical databases highlights an intriguing connection that I'm not aware has been made before. Using category theory to bridge deep learning and databases is a unique direction.

- Defining a schema via a graph and equivalence relations to capture network structure seems more flexible than approaches in other papers that focus on specific architectures like CNNs. This is more general.

- Optimization using adversarial and path equivalence losses generalizes concepts from GANs and CycleGAN in a novel theoretical setting.

- The product task for learning to insert/delete objects is an interesting application that demonstrates the utility of the categorical framework. I'm not familiar with other papers approaching this task in the same way.

Overall, the categorical perspective and formalism appear to be distinctive compared to related work. Making connections between deep learning, databases, and category theory is a contribution unique to this paper. The abstractions also enable flexibility in modeling architectures and defining tasks. If the theoretical ideas could be combined with strong empirical results, this line of research could potentially provide important new tools for deep learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper proposes using category theory to formalize and reason about neural network architectures and deep learning systems. Here are some of the future research directions suggested:

- Incorporating probability distributions and stochastic processes more fully into the categorical framework. The current formulation focuses primarily on deterministic neural networks.

- Expanding the framework to other areas of deep learning besides generative adversarial networks and computer vision, such as recurrent neural networks, meta-learning, etc.

- Further research into categorical formulations of concepts like the adversarial loss function used in GANs. The authors note that adversarial training has not yet been properly framed categorically.

- Exploring additional categorical schemas beyond the simple examples given, and studying what types of schemas admit tractable/useful network instances.

- Applying the categorical perspective to impose more structured inductive biases and regularization beyond just path equivalence relations.

- Using the category theoretic viewpoint as inspiration to conceive new neural network architectures, training paradigms, etc. 

- Leveraging the link to categorical databases to bring in concepts and tools from database theory that could benefit deep learning.

So in summary, the authors propose many avenues for further developing categorical foundations for deep learning, broadening the scope of concepts covered, deriving new architectures and training techniques, and building connections to other fields like databases. Overall the paper presents this as just an initial step towards formally understanding deep learning through category theory.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a formal compositional framework for reasoning about modern neural network architectures using category theory. In the first part of the paper, the author translates key concepts from deep learning like neural network architectures, datasets, and parameter spaces into the language of category theory. For example, neural network architectures are represented as functors between categories and datasets are represented as subfunctors. The optimization process is then framed as gradient descent in a functor space between fixed categories, providing a way to incorporate compositionality and coherence conditions. 

The second part of the paper explores applications of this categorical framework. The author first shows how existing neural network architectures like GANs and CycleGAN can be represented categorically. Then, a novel architecture is proposed for the task of object insertion and deletion in images using unpaired data. The proposed architecture is based on composing two networks with opposing objectives and enforcing cycle consistency constraints categorically. Preliminary experiments demonstrate promising results on removing/inserting glasses from face images. Overall, the categorical perspective provides formal, compositional tools for disentangling and extending neural network architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for compositional deep learning using category theory. The key idea is to represent neural network architectures, datasets, and optimization objectives categorically. Neural networks are modeled as functors between categories, datasets are subfunctors, and optimization involves finding a functor that satisfies certain path equivalences. By abstracting these concepts, the authors show how techniques like adversarial training and cycle consistency can be generalized. A major contribution is the development of the "para" construction to capture parametric polymorphism of neural networks. Overall, this categorical perspective provides a formal, compositional way to reason about complex deep learning systems. The method is demonstrated on tasks like object removal/insertion in images using unpaired data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main points of the paper are:

- It provides a formal, categorical framework for reasoning about modern deep learning architectures and optimization processes. The goal is to translate key concepts in deep learning like neural networks, datasets, and parameter spaces into the language of category theory. 

- It shows how optimization can be done in the "functor space" between categories, rather than just between sets. This allows for a notion of structured, compositional learning.

- It draws a connection between this categorical deep learning formulation and categorical databases. The schemas for specifying network connectivity are similar to database schemas. Cycle consistency conditions are like data integrity constraints.

- It uses this framework to conceive a novel neural network architecture for learning to insert and delete objects in images, using unpaired data. The "product task" gives a categorical perspective on this problem.

- Experiments are done testing this architecture on image datasets. Promising results are obtained, showing the potential of enforcing high-level path equivalence relations to increase inductive bias and enable structured learning.
