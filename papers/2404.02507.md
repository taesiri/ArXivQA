# [Lifelong Event Detection with Embedding Space Separation and Compaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing lifelong event detection methods suffer from two key limitations - (1) simply combining new data and old memory samples for training can still result in substantial forgetting of past knowledge due to potential overlap between feature distributions, and (2) models tend to overfit on the few memory samples rather than effectively retaining learned patterns. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method called Embedding Space Separation and COmpaction (ESCO) to address the above challenges. The key ideas are:

(1) Alleviate forgetting by forcing the feature distribution of new event types away from previously learned embedding space using a margin-based loss. This minimizes the similarity between new samples and prototypes of old events.  

(2) Mitigate overfitting through a memory calibration mechanism that encourages memory samples to stay close to their corresponding prototype. This improves intra-class compactness of learned distributions.

(3) Facilitate forward knowledge transfer by initializing parameters for the new task using those of the previously learned task.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes ESCO, a new method to overcome forgetting and overfitting in lifelong event detection through novel constraints in the embedding space.

- Introduces a margin-based loss for embedding space separation between old and new tasks. 

- Leverages a memory calibration technique to enhance intra-class compactness of learned distributions.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on two event detection benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods.

- Provides extensive analysis on the effectiveness of different components of ESCO.
