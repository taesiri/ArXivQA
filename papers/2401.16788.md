# [Can Large Language Models be Trusted for Evaluation? Scalable   Meta-Evaluation of LLMs as Evaluators via Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging as their capabilities rapidly evolve across diverse tasks. Using other LLMs as evaluators raises questions around reliability.  
- Traditional meta-evaluation to validate evaluators relies on limited benchmarks or costly human annotations, lacking scalability.

Method:
- Proposes ScaleEval, an agent-debate assisted meta-evaluation framework. Leverages capabilities of multiple LLM agents to conduct multi-round discussions and assist human oversight when no consensus reached.
- Enables evaluation of LLMs as evaluators in flexible, user-defined scenarios without need for new benchmark creation.

Experiments:
- Meta-meta evaluation shows ScaleEval has high correlation with human expert annotations, validating its reliability.
- Assesses capabilities and limitations of different LLMs as evaluators across diverse scenarios and criteria.
- Studies impact of variations in evaluation criteria prompts on robustness of LLM evaluators.

Contributions:
- Reliable and scalable framework for meta-evaluation of LLMs as evaluators without reliance on benchmarks.
- Analysis of strengths/weaknesses of different LLMs as evaluators based on criteria and scenario. 
- Demonstration that modifications to criteria prompts significantly affect reliability of LLM evaluators.
- Open-sourced framework to enable further research into LLM evaluation.

The key innovation is enabling scalable meta-evaluation of LLMs as evaluators in flexible user-defined contexts via multi-agent debate and minimal human oversight. This provides a way to validate reliability of LLM evaluators without requiring creation of costly new benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ScaleEval, a scalable meta-evaluation framework for assessing the reliability and robustness of using large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. 

Specifically, ScaleEval introduces an agent-debate assisted meta-evaluation approach that leverages multiple LLM agents to conduct multi-round discussions and evaluations. This helps reduce the human effort required for meta-evaluation compared to traditional approaches that rely solely on human annotations.

The paper demonstrates the reliability of ScaleEval's meta-evaluation approach through meta-meta evaluation, showing it correlates well with human expert judgments. It also conducts comprehensive experiments using ScaleEval to shed light on the capabilities and limitations of various LLMs when used as evaluators across different scenarios and criteria.

Additionally, the paper examines how variations in the formatting of evaluation criteria prompts impacts the robustness of LLMs as evaluators. By open-sourcing the framework, the authors aim to enable the community to efficiently conduct meta-evaluation of LLMs as evaluators for their own specific tasks and scenarios.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Meta-evaluation 
- Scalability
- Agent debate
- Reliability 
- Robustness
- Scenarios (e.g. brainstorming, coding, dialog, etc.)
- Criteria (e.g. helpfulness, interpretability, reasoning, creativity)
- Prompt engineering
- Example-level agreement rate
- System-level agreement rate

The paper proposes a framework called "ScaleEval" which utilizes multi-agent debate between LLMs to conduct meta-evaluation of LLMs as evaluators. The key goals are to enable scalable and reliable meta-evaluation across diverse tasks and scenarios, especially new user-defined ones. The framework aims to assess qualities like the reliability and limitations of LLMs when used as evaluators under different real-world criteria and scenarios. Some key terms revolve around the methodology like agent debate, the agreement rates, and the scenarios and criteria examined. Prompt engineering variations are also analyzed to reveal impacts on LLM evaluator performance. Overall, the core focus areas seem to be scalability, reliability, robustness, and analyzing the capabilities of LLMs as evaluators across diverse scenarios which have associated key terminologies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using agent debate between multiple LLM agents as part of the meta-evaluation framework. What are some key considerations in determining the number of agents to use, and what impact could this have on the reliability of the evaluations produced? 

2. When the LLM agents fail to reach a consensus after multiple rounds of debate, the framework calls for a human evaluator to intervene. What standards could be established to determine when it is appropriate for the human to intervene versus allowing more debate rounds between the agents?

3. The paper evaluates the framework on a limited set of scenarios (8) and criteria (4). What steps would need to be taken to scale up meta-evaluation to a much broader and rapidly evolving set of real-world tasks and evaluation criteria?

4. Could adversarial attacks (e.g. manipulating the prompts or seed texts) reduce the reliability of evaluations produced by this framework? How could the framework be made more robust to such attacks?

5. The paper studies single LLM evaluators. How could the multi-agent debate aspect be incorporated directly into the individual LLM evaluator models themselves for more reliable single model evaluation?

6. How sensitive is the performance of LLM evaluators in this framework to the specific prompt phrasing for the criteria being evaluated? What best practices around prompt engineering could make the system more robust?  

7. What techniques could make the multi-agent debate framework less reliant on human oversight over time (e.g. training agents specifically for the meta-evaluation task)? What risks might exist in fully automating meta-evaluation?

8. How could the multi-agent debate framework be extended to produce improved justifications and transparency around the rationale behind evaluation decisions, rather than just a label?

9. Could multi-agent debate reveal "blindspots" in LLM evaluators around certain types of responses or criteria where humans and models systematically disagree? If so, how could this inform iterative improvements?  

10. The paper focuses on open-ended text generation tasks, but could agent-debate based meta-evaluation be effective for more complex artifact generation tasks (e.g. images, music, code)? What challenges might emerge?
