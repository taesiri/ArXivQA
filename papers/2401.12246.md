# [Orion-14B: Open-source Multilingual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper introduces Orion-14B, a family of open-source multilingual language models (LLMs) with 14 billion parameters. Recently, large proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown impressive capabilities, but their model details are not publicly available. In contrast, open-source models like LLaMA provide transparency but have focused primarily on English. Hence, there is a need for open-source multilingual LLMs to advance research across languages.  

Proposed Solution 
The authors train a diverse LLM family called Orion-14B on 2.5 trillion multilingual tokens spanning English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and others. A base foundation model forms the core, with additional fine-tuned models tailored for conversations, long context handling, model compression and specialized applications. Notably, they schedule training data in increasing complexity and linguistic diversity to boost efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate Orion-14B's state-of-the-art performance on language understanding, reasoning and examination tasks across multiple languages.

Key Contributions
- Release Orion-14B model family under open source for advancing research 
- Show strong results across English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean benchmarks
- Illustrate a data scheduling approach to strategically order training data
- Highlight issues around evaluation dataset contamination and overfitting
- Provide base, chat and specialized models tailored for diverse real-world needs

Overall, the paper makes leading multilingual LLMs openly available to democratize research. It also sets strong baselines and offers insights into efficient training methodology as well as integrity in evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Orion-14B is a family of open-source multilingual language models with 14 billion parameters, pretrained on 2.5 trillion tokens and demonstrating strong performance across a diverse range of tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of Orion-14B, a diverse family of multilingual large language models with 14 billion parameters. Key highlights include:

- Development of a pretrained foundation model (Orion-14B) trained on a diverse corpus of 2.5 trillion tokens spanning multiple languages like English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks.

- Fine-tuning of the foundation model to create specialized chat models for conversational applications. These are evaluated using standard test sets, subjective benchmarks, and human assessments, showing strong capabilities. 

- Additional extension works to develop variants like a long-context model, a quantized model, and application-specific models for retrieval augmentation, plugin functions etc.

- Open-sourcing of the entire Orion-14B model suite to promote further research and practical applications in the field of large language models.

In summary, the paper's main contribution is the introduction and thorough evaluation of the Orion-14B family of models to serve as competitive multilingual LLMs that can enable future progress.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a data scheduling strategy during training. Can you elaborate on the specifics of how you structured and organized the training data across different stages? What were the key principles or methodology behind this scheduling?

2. You compare the compression ratios of your tokenizer to other models. What factors affect the compression ratio? How did you optimize your tokenizer to achieve a high compression ratio while maintaining adequate vocabulary coverage?

3. When using FlashAttention2 and APEX for optimization, what specific parameters or configurations did you use? Were there any tricks or tips that gave better optimization results? 

4. The validation loss plot during training shows drops aligning with data distribution shifts. Does this indicate that the model had to re-adapt at those points? Or was it expected as part of continuously improving?

5. For the overfitting analysis, how exactly did you construct the unseen Internet text dataset for computing loss? What steps did you take to ensure it was truly unseen and not contaminated?

6. Orion-14B demonstrates great performance on Japanese and Korean benchmarks, despite relatively little training data in those languages. To what do you attribute this effective transfer learning? Did you take any special steps to enable it?

7. What do you think accounts for the score decline on some benchmarks when evaluating the chat vs base model? Is it a flaw in the chat model or an issue with how those benchmarks are designed?

8. The human evaluation arena method sounds very interesting. Can you explain more about how you designed the annotation instructions and criteria for the human raters?

9. For the long context and quantized models, what specialized techniques or architectures did you employ compared to the base Orion-14B? What performance tradeoffs exist?

10. You mention using supervised fine-tuning but also explore RLHF and DPO in the future. What advantages do you expect from those methods? What challenges need to be overcome to implement them effectively?
