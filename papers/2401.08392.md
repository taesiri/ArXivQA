# [DoraemonGPT: Toward Understanding Dynamic Scenes with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision agents driven by large language models (LLMs) mainly focus on solving tasks for static images, limiting their ability to understand the dynamic nature of the real world. 
- Videos better capture the spatial-temporal aspects of real-world scenarios. Developing LLM-driven agents for dynamic video tasks involves challenges like spatial-temporal reasoning, larger planning spaces, and limited knowledge.

Proposed Solution - DoraemonGPT:
- Converts input video into a symbolic memory storing task-relevant spatial-temporal attributes. Supports instance-centric and time-centric memories.
- Sub-task tools query memories for different reasoning, e.g. "When...", "Why...", using SQL. External knowledge tools provide domain expertise.  
- Novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner explores planning space to find multiple solutions by backpropagating reward. Summarizes solutions into an improved final answer.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptually elegant LLM-driven system to handle dynamic video tasks via task-related symbolic memory and specialized reasoning tools.
- MCTS planner that can efficiently explore large planning spaces and summarize multiple solutions to questions for better final answers.
- Extensible system design through plug-and-play knowledge tools and utility tools.
- Extensive evaluation showing superiority over recent works on a standard benchmark and promising results on complex real-world video questions.

In summary, the paper introduces DoraemonGPT, an intuitive yet versatile LLM-driven agent to solve challenging dynamic video tasks through structured video representation, specialized reasoning tools and an MCTS planner. Key innovations enable spatial-temporal understanding, efficient planning space exploration and knowledge incorporation.
