# [VJT: A Video Transformer on Joint Tasks of Deblurring, Low-light   Enhancement and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video restoration aims to recover high-quality videos from low-quality observations. This contains video denoising, deblurring and low-light enhancement. 
- These degradations often happen simultaneously in real-world videos taken in extreme conditions, posing significant challenges if one wants to remove them together.  
- Existing methods handle these issues separately and lose valuable joint information in sequential processing. There is a lack of suitable datasets and leading methods for the joint task.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes VJT, an end-to-end multi-tier video transformer for joint video deblurring, low-light enhancement and denoising.
- Designs a multi-tier decoder where each tier targets ground truth videos with different degradation levels to progressively learn features. 
- Introduces a tier-to-tier feature fusion scheme to transfer features between tiers and accelerate training.
- Employs an adaptive weighting scheme to balance different loss functions for faster convergence.
- Generates a new Multi-scene Lowlight-Blur-Noise dataset with 195 realistic indoor and outdoor scenes for the joint task.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneers in proposing an end-to-end transformer approach VJT for joint video deblurring, low-light enhancement and denoising.
- Designs multi-tier architecture and feature fusion to enable progressive joint task learning.
- Utilizes adaptive loss weighting for faster convergence during training.  
- Creates a new dataset containing 195 realistic scenes for the joint degradation task.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative multi-tier video transformer and dataset to address the joint video restoration task. Both architectural designs and loss tuning lead to superior performance over existing methods.

 This paper proposes a multi-tier video transformer with feature fusion and adaptive loss weighting for the joint task of video deblurring, low-light enhancement, and denoising, along with a new multi-scene low-light blur noise dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a multi-tier video transformer (VJT) framework for the joint tasks of video deblurring, low-light enhancement, and denoising. The multi-tier structure and feature fusion allow progressively learning features for the joint task.

2. Using an adaptive weight loss scheme to balance different loss functions and accelerate training.

3. Creating a new Multi-scene Low-light Blur Noise (MLBN) dataset with a proposed data generation pipeline to simulate realistic degraded videos.

4. Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed VJT framework and MLBN dataset on the joint restoration task.

In summary, the key innovations are in designing a transformer tailored for the video joint restoration task, an effective training strategy, and a dataset to facilitate research in this direction. The experiments validate the effectiveness of these contributions.
