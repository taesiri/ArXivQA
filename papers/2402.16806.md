# [Multi-Human Mesh Recovery with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most human mesh recovery (HMR) methods take a region-based approach - cropping out each person and processing them individually. This works well for single people but has limitations when there are multiple people in an image:
  - Computation scales with number of people, needing to process each one separately
  - Loses global context and relative positioning between people
- Whole-image-based methods avoid this by processing the full image simultaneously, but early attempts underperform recent region-based methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new whole-image transformer-based model for multi-person HMR with three key designs:
  1) Multi-scale features retain both contextual and detailed joint information
  2) Deformable attention focuses on pertinent regions, ignoring irrelevant backgrounds
  3) Novel relative joint loss supervises relative positions between people

Contributions:  
- Advocates for under-explored whole-image methods to leverage global context and jointly model multiple people
- Introduces streamlined transformer model specially designed for whole-image HMR 
- Achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing both region-based and whole-image methods on multi-person benchmarks, especially in relative joint positioning metric

In summary, the paper presents a new technique to address limitations of prevailing region-based HMR approaches for multi-person images. By processing the full image simultaneously and using tailored designs like deformable attention and relative joint supervision, their whole-image transformer method better models interactions and relative positioning between multiple people.
