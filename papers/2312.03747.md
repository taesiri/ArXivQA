# [Classifying patient voice in social media data using neural networks: A   comparison of AI models on different data sources and therapeutic domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need to better understand patient experiences with drugs and care in order to improve personalized medicine and treatment outcomes. However, capturing patient experiences accurately is challenging using traditional methods.
- The paper hypothesizes that patient language differs across therapeutic domains (cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology) and data sources (Reddit, SocialGist). Thus patient voice data cannot all be treated and collected in the same way.

Proposed Solution: 
- Collect patient posts from Reddit and SocialGist across 4 therapeutic domains.
- Manually annotate posts as patient voice or not relevant. 
- Perform linguistic analysis to understand similarities and differences in patient language.
- Use TF-IDF and cosine similarity analysis to statistically quantify text similarities.
- Train CNN and Transformer classifiers on domain/source specific datasets as well as combined datasets.
- Compare performance across classifiers to determine optimal methodology.

Key Findings:
- Linguistic analysis revealed distinct language used by patients depending on domain and source.  
- TF-IDF analysis showed vocabulary similarities within domain across sources, except for immunology.
- The transformer classifier trained on the combined "all data" dataset performed best overall, with highest F1 scores.
- The results confirm the hypothesis that understanding differences in patient language enables more accurate classification.

Main Contributions:
- Novel linguistic and statistical text analysis tailored to patient voice data across domains/sources
- Determining optimal methodology for identifying patient voice through thorough classifier comparisons
- Demonstrating importance of analyzing patient language commonalities for improved classification performance
