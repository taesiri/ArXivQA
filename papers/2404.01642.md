# [ADVREPAIR:Provable Repair of Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations to inputs can cause incorrect predictions. This poses safety risks for DNNs deployed in critical domains like healthcare and autonomous vehicles.  
- Existing neuron-level repair methods using limited data lack efficacy in fixing adversaries due to the complexity of attack mechanisms. Adversarial training requires a large number of samples and lacks provability.
- There is a need for provable and efficient methods to repair adversarial attacks using limited data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AdvRepair, a novel approach for provable repair of adversarial attacks using limited data.
- It constructs patch modules integrated with the original network that provide specialized and provable repairs within robustness neighborhoods. 
- An external indicator assigns patch modules to inputs using both property-based rules and heuristics, enabling generalization.
- AdvRepair trains patch modules using DeepPoly verification to derive a loss function that reaches zero when local robustness is provably repaired.

Main Contributions:
- First approach for provable repair of adversarial attacks using limited data, significantly advancing state-of-the-art.
- Constructs patch modules tailored to repair local robustness properties, ensuring specialization.
- External indicator enables generalization of repair to global dataset. 
- Uses DeepPoly's loss function to ensure patches provably repair assigned regions.
- Demonstrates superior efficiency, scalability and repair success over existing methods on multiple datasets and models.
- Exhibits excellent generalization capability to handle global inputs, robustly enhancing network's resilience.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in achieving both provably-robust and generalized repair of adversarial attacks with limited data through a specialized patch-based method.
