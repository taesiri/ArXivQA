# [RENOVI: A Benchmark Towards Remediating Norm Violations in   Socio-Cultural Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the issue of norm violations in socio-cultural conversations, which occur when individuals fail to conform to culturally accepted behaviors. Such violations can lead to conflicts, so there is a need for interactive AI systems to have the ability to remediate them by demonstrating social awareness and cultural sensitivity.

Proposed Solution 
The authors construct a novel benchmark called "ReNoVi" with 9,258 Chinese dialogues to equip language models with remediation capabilities. The dialogues consist of 512 human-authored ones and 8,746 synthetic conversations generated by ChatGPT. Four main tasks are defined: 
1) Detecting negative norm violations
2) Estimating impact of violations  
3) Generating remediation measures guided by Interaction Adaptation Theory 
4) Justifying remediation measures by explaining relevant norm knowledge

By training on ReNoVi, models can learn to not just flag inappropriate behaviors but also take proper steps to resolve issues and avoid potential conflicts. Both human-authored and synthetic data help mitigate scarcity while assessing alignment between humans and LLMs on social norms.

Main Contributions
- First large-scale Chinese corpus for remediating norm violations in conversations 
- Formulation of a series of operationalized tasks based on relevant sociological theories 
- Analysis of differences between human-created and synthetic dialogues 
- Experiments demonstrating utility of combining both types of data for enhanced performance

The work provides an important benchmark to enhance model capabilities in conducting smooth socio-cultural conversations. It opens promising directions for future cross-cultural and multilingual expansions.
