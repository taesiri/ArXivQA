# [Surpassing GPT-4 Medical Coding with a Two-Stage Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13735)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces LLM-codex, a two-stage approach for predicting medical ICD codes and providing sentence-level evidence to explain the predictions. LLM-codex first uses a large language model (LLM) to generate ICD code predictions with high recall but lower precision. It then employs an LSTM-based Verifier model in the second stage to verify the LLM's predictions, learning from both the LLM's high recall and human experts' high precision. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that LLM-codex achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy for rare ICD codes and with limited training data. Notably, without requiring training on human-annotated evidence, LLM-codex also substantially improves evidence identification accuracy compared to prior work. The method addresses three key challenges concurrently: 1) accuracy with limited training data; 2) accuracy on rare codes; and 3) explainability through sentence-level evidence. By effectively balancing precision and recall, LLM-codex demonstrates capabilities unmatched by previous methods on the medical coding task. The authors highlight the potential of the approach for classification tasks beyond healthcare that demand model explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes LLM-codex, a two-stage model that uses a large language model to predict ICD codes and sentence-level evidence from clinical notes, followed by a verification stage to improve precision, achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical coding accuracy and evidence extraction without requiring human-annotated evidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage model called LLM-codex for medical coding of clinical notes. Specifically:

1) LLM-codex uses a large language model (LLM) in the first stage to extract ICD codes and sentence-level evidence from clinical notes. This helps achieve high recall but lower precision due to over-prediction. 

2) In the second stage, LLM-codex employs an LSTM-based "Verifier" model to verify the ICD codes and evidence extracted by the LLM. The Verifier model is trained using a custom loss function that leverages the LLM's high recall and human experts' high precision.

3) Experiments show that LLM-codex achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical coding accuracy, especially for rare codes and with limited training data. Additionally, it can provide sentence-level evidence to explain predictions without needing explicit evidence annotations.

In summary, the main contribution is a two-stage LLM-codex model that concurrently addresses major challenges in automated medical coding - accuracy, performance on rare codes, limited annotations, and explainability.

The paper introduces LLM-codex, a two-stage approach for medical coding that uses a large language model in the first stage and a Verifier model in the second stage. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in predicting ICD codes, even with limited training data and for rare codes, while also providing sentence-level evidence to explain the predictions. Key elements include using the LLM to extract high recall code-evidence pairs, training the Verifier model on both the LLM's silver labels and human gold labels, and designing a custom loss function to integrate their signals. The approach achieves strong results across accuracy, rare code prediction, and explainability compared to previous methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage approach called LLM-codex. Can you explain in detail the motivation and intuition behind using a two-stage approach instead of a single model? What are the advantages?

2. Stage 1 of LLM-codex uses an LLM to extract ICD codes and evidence sentences. What modifications were made to the prompt engineering and output parsing to enable the LLM to effectively perform this task? 

3. The paper argues that segmenting long EHRs into smaller chunks improves the LLM's performance. What is the explanation for this? How was the optimal number of segments determined?

4. Stage 2 of LLM-codex introduces a Verifier model. Explain the architecture, input representations, and loss function of this model. Why is the Verifier model necessary? 

5. The Verifier model loss function incorporates both gold and silver labels. Detail the difference between these labels, how they are obtained, and their purposes in the loss formulation.  

6. Analyze the results of the ablation study in Table 5. What do the findings indicate about the contribution of the two LLM-codex stages to overall performance?

7. One limitation mentioned is LLM-codex's constraint of outputting only one evidence sentence per predicted code. Propose two methods to modify LLM-codex to output multiple evidence sentences and analyze their potential impact.  

8. The error analysis highlights excessive prediction of V-codes by the LLM. What are possible reasons for this overprediction? How can it be addressed?

9. Compare the pros and cons of LLM-codex against other baselines like MSMN and EffectiveCAN. In what scenarios would you prefer one over the other? 

10. The paper claims LLM-codex can generalize to other document classification tasks. Detail which components would need to be adapted and what new challenges may emerge when extending it to other domains or tasks.
