# [PTT: Point-Trajectory Transformer for Efficient Temporal 3D Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08371)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Point-Trajectory Transformer (PTT) for efficient temporal 3D object detection from LiDAR data. The key insight is to only use the current frame's point cloud along with historical proposal trajectories spanning multiple frames as input. This avoids storing per-frame point clouds, reducing memory overhead, and allows handling longer sequences. The PTT module effectively encodes features from the single-frame point cloud and multi-frame trajectories using long short-term memory and future prediction. It integrates current point features with sequential trajectory context via a point-trajectory aggregator. Extensive experiments on Waymo show state-of-the-art performance, using 64 frames with lower memory cost and faster runtime versus prior arts. The ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the proposed components. In summary, PTT advances efficient online temporal 3D detection by establishing connections between points and trajectories across frames without storing costly per-frame points.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Point-Trajectory Transformer that efficiently performs temporal 3D object detection by exploiting long-term multi-frame proposal trajectories and interactions between single-frame point clouds and trajectories while minimizing memory overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a temporal 3D object detection framework that efficiently considers only the point cloud in the current frame, along with longer historical proposal trajectories. This reduces memory overhead compared to prior works that store multi-frame point clouds.

2. Introducing a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory and future encoding to efficiently extract features from single-frame point clouds and multi-frame trajectories, eliminating the need to store multi-frame point clouds.

3. Comprehensive experiments and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method, allowing longer temporal information to be leveraged with lower cost while still achieving favorable results against other approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient temporal 3D detection model, called Point-Trajectory Transformer (PTT), that can process longer sequences of LiDAR frames using just current frame points and historical proposal trajectories. This is more memory-efficient than prior arts while achieving better performance.
