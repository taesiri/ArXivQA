# [PTT: Point-Trajectory Transformer for Efficient Temporal 3D Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08371)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Point-Trajectory Transformer (PTT) for efficient temporal 3D object detection from LiDAR data. The key insight is to only use the current frame's point cloud along with historical proposal trajectories spanning multiple frames as input. This avoids storing per-frame point clouds, reducing memory overhead, and allows handling longer sequences. The PTT module effectively encodes features from the single-frame point cloud and multi-frame trajectories using long short-term memory and future prediction. It integrates current point features with sequential trajectory context via a point-trajectory aggregator. Extensive experiments on Waymo show state-of-the-art performance, using 64 frames with lower memory cost and faster runtime versus prior arts. The ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the proposed components. In summary, PTT advances efficient online temporal 3D detection by establishing connections between points and trajectories across frames without storing costly per-frame points.
