# [Activating Frequency and ViT for 3D Point Cloud Quality Assessment   without Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
As 3D point clouds (PCs) require large storage and transmission bandwidth, compression is often needed which can degrade visual quality. Thus, methods for no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) are needed to evaluate quality without access to the original uncompressed PC. Existing NR-PCQA methods have limitations in performance and efficiency. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new NR-PCQA method using a hybrid deep learning model combining deformable convolutions and vision transformers (ViT). The key ideas are:

1) Extract 3 input attributes from PC patches: RGB color, coordinates (x,y,z), and novel frequency magnitude information using FFT. Frequency captures spatial deformation patterns from compression. 

2) Input attributes are fed into a lightweight Deformable ConvNet (DCN) + ViT model to map features to quality score. DCN handles non-uniform PC distribution. ViT models global contexts.

3) Model is trained to predict mean opinion scores (MOS) using a dataset with compressed PCs and human quality ratings. SmoothL1 loss is used.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first use of ViT for NR-PCQA to better model global contexts 
- Novel use of frequency magnitude as an input attribute indicator of quality
- Achieves state-of-the-art NR performance on PointXR dataset
- Computationally efficient model with fast runtime suitable for real-time use
- Ablations demonstrate value of proposed frequency attribute

The method provides an accurate and efficient NR-PCQA solution by effectively combining geometry, color, frequency cues and advanced deep learning.
