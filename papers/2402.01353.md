# [Efficient compilation of expressive problem space specifications to   neural network solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an "embedding gap" between high-level specifications written by domain experts in the interpretable problem space, and the low-level queries that neural network solvers can process in the uninterpretable embedding space. 
- Existing domain specific languages (DSLs) for writing neural network specifications have limited expressiveness. They cannot express properties with multiple network applications, conditional statements, arbitrary quantification, or specifications in the original problem space.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a DSL and compilation algorithm that allows highly expressive specifications referring to multiple networks, conditional statements, quantification over problem space variables that are linearly transformed before being input to networks.
- The algorithm compiles specifications down to a query language similar to VNNLib, supporting conjunctions, disjunctions and linear constraints over multiple network input/output variables.
- To enable problem space specifications, new vector and index types are added. Quantified vector variables can be kept as vectors as long as they are only used in vector equality constraints, otherwise they are expanded to their elements.
- The compilation algorithm uses normalization, "unblocking" to handle conditionals and network applications, and procedures to eliminate logical operators. It splits queries when necessary to maintain consistent variable assignments.

Main Contributions:
- Algorithm that compiles an extremely expressive high-level DSL for neural network specifications down to low-level solver queries, overcoming issues like nested network applications, hidden conditionals and inconsistent variable assignments.
- Quantified problem space variables are supported and can be kept as vectors as long as possible, avoiding exponential blowups.
- The algorithm is proven correct for a range of challenging examples and shown to scale optimally even for large numbers of variables.
- This helps bridge the "embedding gap" by allowing domain experts to write highly expressive logical specifications that refer to the original problem space, not just the embedding space.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an algorithm for efficiently compiling high-level, interpretable problem space specifications written in an expressive domain specific language into low-level, uninterpretable queries that can be solved by neural network verification tools.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting an algorithm for compiling high-level problem-space specifications down to low-level embedding space queries that can be handled by neural network solvers. The key aspects of this contribution include:

- Allowing specifications to refer to arbitrary numbers of networks, network applications, quantifiers, conditional statements, and higher-order functions. This makes the specification language much more expressive than prior DSLs for neural network verification.

- Supporting quantified variables that can be linearly transformed before being used as neural network inputs. This allows specifications to be written in terms of interpretable values in the problem space rather than uninterpretable embedding space values.

- Describing techniques to efficiently compile challenging specification patterns involving nested network applications, hidden boolean structure, under/over-constrained user variables, and quantified vector variables blocking evaluation.

- Providing a compilation algorithm that provably scales optimally for common specification types even when the number of neural network inputs/outputs is very large.

So in summary, the key contribution is enabling domain experts to write highly expressive logical specifications about neural networks in an interpretable problem space, and efficiently compiling those down into low-level solver queries. This helps bridge the "embedding gap" that has existed in prior neural network verification tools.

The paper discusses developing a domain specific language and efficient compilation algorithm to translate high-level specifications written in terms of an interpretable problem space into low-level constraints and queries that can be handled by neural network solvers. Key goals are to support more expressive specifications with things like quantifiers and conditional statements compared to prior DSLs, while still compiling efficiently even for large networks. The notion of the "embedding gap" between problem spaces and embedding spaces is also central.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper states that specifications can be written to refer to arbitrary numbers of networks and network applications. What are some examples of specifications that would require referring to multiple networks? How does allowing for multiple network references increase the expressivity of the language?

2) One of the contributions stated is the ability to write specifications in terms of the problem space rather than just the embedding space. Can you elaborate on why this is important from an interpretability and usability perspective? Provide some examples illustrating the difference. 

3) The compilation algorithm makes crucial use of the notion of "blocking" on variables and expressions during normalization. Explain in more detail what blocking means and how identifying blocking subexpressions helps drive the overall compilation process.

4) Eliminating existential quantifiers requires solving for the introduced variable in terms of the embedding space inputs. Discuss the complications that can arise in consistently solving for these variables, especially in the presence of disjunctions. 

5) The algorithm employs a number of non-trivial techniques to avoid exponential explosions, such as only converting queries to disjunctive normal form when necessarily. Analyze one of these techniques in more depth and discuss the worst-case scenarios it helps avoid.

6) Discuss the subtleties around the choice to keep vector variables versus expand them out into their scalar element variables during normalization. What efficiency issues does this address and how does it impact other parts of the algorithm?

7) One limitation mentioned is that specifications with non-linear relationships between problem space and embedding space cannot be compiled. Can you conceive of an approach that would allow handling at least some forms of non-linear relationships? What complications would it introduce?

8) The paper states the algorithm is implemented in Haskell. What aspects of Haskell were particularly helpful or enabled cleaner implementations of concepts like blocking and unblocking expressions?

9) While soundness holds over the real numbers, issues arise when targeting floating point solvers. Propose some techniques that could help make the approach more robust to floating point errors and instability. 

10) Beyond expanding expressivity, discuss some other ways the DSL and compilation algorithm could be extended, for example to compile to abstract interpretation domains or provide better user explanations when specifications don't conform to solver capabilities.
