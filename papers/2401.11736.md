# [Attention on Personalized Clinical Decision Support System: Federated   Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Health management and disease prevention is a critical challenge for building smart city infrastructure. Using AI and neural networks to assist in medical diagnosis shows promise, but requires large amounts of clinical data that is often heterogeneous, vulnerable, and privacy-sensitive. 
- Existing medical diagnosis models need to be retrained from scratch when new symptoms or diseases are added, limiting their ability to expand and evolve.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a clinical decision support system using a sequence-to-sequence deep recurrent neural network with attention mechanism, trained in a federated learning framework across distributed edge devices.

- Edge AI allows local processing on devices to reduce communication costs and avoid transmitting private clinical data. 

- Federated learning allows collaborative training of a shared global model on decentralized data, without compromising sensitive information.

- Sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism allows easy adaptation to new symptoms and diseases without full retraining.

Main Contributions:

- System architecture for an edge-based personalized clinical decision support system using AI.

- Apply attention mechanism in sequence-to-sequence networks for each local model to focus on relevant symptoms. 

- Use federated learning to train models collaboratively on non-IID symptom-disease datasets distributed across devices.

- Shared global model aggregates gradients to capture collective knowledge without needing private data.

- Evolvable system can adapt to new symptoms and diseases without full retraining.

- Improves prediction accuracy over centralized approaches and preserves patient privacy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a federated learning-based clinical decision support system with an attention mechanism embedded in sequence-to-sequence networks to provide accurate and evolvable disease predictions while preserving patient privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. Designing the system architecture of an edge-based personalized clinical decision support system to jointly work with AI technology.

2. Applying the attention mechanism in the sequence-to-sequence network architecture of the medical diagnosis model for each edge device. 

3. Exploiting the federated learning framework to train the personalized models collaboratively in a distributed manner on non-IID symptom-disease datasets.

4. Adopting a centralized global model to capture the shared knowledge of all personalized models by aggregating their gradients, regardless of their private information. 

5. Designing the models with evolvable characteristics to adapt to new kinds of symptoms and diseases without retraining from scratch.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an evolvable clinical decision support system under a federated learning paradigm that can provide accurate and personalized disease predictions while preserving patient privacy. The attention mechanism and distributed training approach also make the system adaptable to new data.
