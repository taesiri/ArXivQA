# [User-Aware Prefix-Tuning is a Good Learner for Personalized Image   Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional image captioning methods generate standardized captions that fail to incorporate users' personalized characteristics and preferences. Although some existing work has attempted to address this through user context modeling, they require training the entire caption model from scratch for new datasets, which is computationally expensive.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called User-Aware Prefix-Tuning (UAPT) for personalized image captioning. The key ideas are:

1) Utilize a frozen CLIP model to extract visual features and a learnable mapping network to align the visual semantics with language space. 

2) Capture users' writing style preferences using TF-IDF on their posts and fuse with aligned visual features through a small trainable fusion transformer. This generates prefix embeddings for each user-image pair.

3) Employ frozen GPT-2 model and feed the prefix embeddings to generate personalized captions through prefix tuning. This adapts GPT-2 to user's style without full model fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to adapt large language model for personalized image captioning through prefix tuning, avoiding expensive full model re-training.

2) Effectively incorporate user context by fusing user writing style embedding with image semantics to capture personalized language. 

3) Outperforms prior works on two benchmark datasets significantly across metrics like BLEU, METEOR etc. Some metrics improved over 2 times.

4) Qualitative results show capability to generate captions tailored to users' vocabulary choices and writing patterns.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient and effective approach for personalized image captioning using prefix tuning with user context modeling. The main advantage is avoiding full model re-training for new users or datasets.
