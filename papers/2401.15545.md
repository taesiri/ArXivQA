## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Benchmarking large code generation models (LCGMs) requires creating diverse programming problems with prompt, solution, and test cases. 
- Existing methods have limitations:
    - Manual methods require high human effort, lack scalability, risk data integrity.
    - Perturbation methods generate semantically homogeneous problems with typos easily fixed by IDEs.
- Challenges: 
    - Automating semantically diverse canonical solution generation
    - Ensuring long-term data integrity
    - Generating natural and realistic programming problems

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "Programming Problem Merging" (PPM) by combining two problems to create new ones with distinct semantics. Derive new canonical solution from original two.
- Inject randomness into PPM to guarantee no repetition and long-term integrity. Define large random search space.
- Propose "Lambda Programming Problem" - concise natural language description with code implementation. Ensures grammar correctness. Conducts return value type analysis to verify new solutions.

Contributions:
- Present concept of Programming Problem Merging to automatically create semantically diverse problems for benchmarking LCGMs
- Incorporate randomness into process, enabling long-term data integrity
- Introduce Lambda Programming Problem to generate coherent and natural problems
- Empirically demonstrate PPM generates more challenging, diverse and natural problems than baselines when evaluated on LCGMs

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations of existing techniques for benchmarking LCGMs by merging programming problems to create semantic diversity and leveraging lambda tasks with randomness for integrity and naturalness. Experiments confirm the approach surpasses baselines in generating problems that reveal issues in LCGMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel approach called Programming Problem Merging (PPM) for automatically generating diverse and natural programming problems by merging existing problems, with the goal of effectively benchmarking large code generation models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents the concept of Programming Problem Merging (PPM), a novel methodology to create programming problems with diverse semantics that are valuable for benchmarking large code generation models. 

2. It offers two practical implementations based on the core principles of PPM that leverage lambda programming tasks: type-aware value transformation (PPM-T) and pure value transformation (PPM-V). These generate new semantic diverse programming problems.

3. The empirical evaluation shows PPM's exceptional ability to generate programming problems with remarkable semantic diversity. This helps uncover limitations of existing large code generation models, setting it apart from other methods that mainly produce problems with homogeneous semantics.

4. PPM excels at generating natural and realistic programming problems that maintain long-term data integrity, while also providing stable benchmarking results.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and evaluation of the Programming Problem Merging (PPM) methodology for automatically creating semantically diverse and natural programming problems to effectively benchmark large code generation models.
