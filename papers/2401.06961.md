# [CHAMP: A Competition-level Dataset for Fine-Grained Analyses of LLMs'   Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown some ability in mathematical reasoning when solving simple math problems. However, their performance on more challenging, competition-level problems has been unclear. In addition, while providing intermediate reasoning steps (chain-of-thought prompting) and access to external tools like calculators can help, whether LLMs can make use of other helpful side information like problem-specific hints has not been explored.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new benchmark dataset called CHAMP (Concept and Hint-Annotated Math Problems) to enable analysis of LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities. CHAMP consists of 270 high school competition-level math problems spanning 5 categories (number theory, polynomials, sequences, inequalities, combinatorics). 

In addition to the problem statement and full solution, each problem is annotated with relevant concepts (general math facts/theorems) and hints (problem-specific tricks). The authors design 17 prompts to test how concepts and hints impact reasoning of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo and PaLM 2 Medium.

The authors further manually annotate model-generated solutions to identify the first wrong reasoning step, if any. This allows benchmarking how well models can verify solutions.

Main Contributions:

- CHAMP dataset with competition problems annotated with concepts and hints 

- Analysis of how concepts and hints impact reasoning abilities of latest LLMs

- Manual annotation of model solutions for first wrong step  

- Benchmarking model solution verification capability

- Findings showing models often get right answers via wrong reasoning, and struggle at verifying solutions

- CHAMP enables finer-grained testing of LLMs' mathematical reasoning than possible before

The key innovation is the concept and hint annotation of problems to analyze reasoning, along with the first wrong step annotation of model solutions to benchmark verification ability, enabling insights not possible with other math datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new math dataset for evaluating large language models' ability to solve challenging competition-level problems, make use of helpful concepts and hints, generate fully correct reasoning chains, and verify solutions, finding that current models still have deficiencies in these areas.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing CHAMP, a new benchmark dataset of 270 high-school level math competition problems. Each problem is annotated with relevant concepts (general math facts) and hints (problem-specific tricks).

2. Enabling new ways to analyze reasoning abilities of large language models using this dataset, through experiments that provide concepts/hints in different ways, give misleading concepts, or connect problems via shared concepts.

3. Annotating 540 solutions from various models on a subset of problems to identify the first wrong step. This allows benchmarking how well models can verify solutions in addition to generating them.

4. Identifying through experiments that while some models can benefit from concepts and hints, overall performance on competition math is still limited. The first wrong step annotations also show models often accidentally get the right answer through incorrect reasoning.

In summary, the paper introduces a new benchmark to analyze mathematical reasoning, highlighting current limitations of large language models in this area as well as potential directions for improving them. The dataset and annotations enable finer-grained evaluation than just final answer accuracy.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper:

- Challenging math problems: The paper introduces CHAMP, a dataset of 270 high-school competition-level math problems, which are designed to be challenging and require creative problem-solving techniques.

- Concepts and hints: In addition to problem statements and solutions, CHAMP annotates each problem with relevant mathematical concepts and problem-specific hints. This allows analyzing how models use additional helpful information.

- Reasoning evaluation: The paper evaluates reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and PaLM 2 on solving these problems and using the concept/hint annotations.

- Solution correctness: The paper annotates model-generated solutions by labeling the first wrong reasoning step, allowing evaluation beyond just final answer correctness.

- Solution verification: Using the first wrong step annotations, the paper tests how well models can verify a given solution instead of generating it.

- Prompting methods: Different prompting techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc. are tested with the models.

- Concept provision: Different ways of providing concepts to models (directly, through retrieval, examples, etc.) are evaluated.  

In summary, key terms cover math reasoning evaluation, solution correctness analysis, concept utilization, and verification abilities of LLMs using a newly introduced challenging dataset CHAMP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called CHAMP for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. What are some key advantages of CHAMP compared to existing math datasets? How does it enable new types of analyses?

2. The paper evaluates performance of models on generating correct final answers versus full solutions. What are some reasons why models might get the final answer correct despite having mistakes in the reasoning steps? 

3. The annotations of first wrong steps in model solutions enable testing the solution verification abilities of models. Why is this an important capability, and how well do current models perform at this task?

4. The paper tests providing concepts and hints in various ways, such as directly, by concept name, through example problems, etc. Analyze the differences in performance across concept provision methods - what factors might explain when certain methods are more or less effective?

5. When provided with irrelevant or misleading concepts, model performance varies - GPT-3.5 and 4 are robust but GPT-4 Turbo struggles more. What hypotheses might explain these differences? How could the models' behaviors be further tested?  

6. The paper relies on supervision from the authors for labeling concepts, hints, solutions, and first wrong steps. Discuss the limitations of manual annotation. What are some ideas for expanding the scale of annotation in a reliable way?

7. Analyze the prompts used for eliciting solutions, answer summaries, concept explanations, and for solution verification. What are someprompt design choices that could potentially improve model performance? 

8. The best model accuracy is 58-67% on CHAMP. Discuss what advancements are still needed for models to reliably solve these competition math problems. What current weaknesses need to be addressed?

9. Besides evaluating mathematical reasoning, what other potential model capabilities could CHAMP be used for analysing, with its fine-grained annotations? 

10. The authors focus the analysis on certain model sizes from GPT, PaLM and LLaMA. How would the results potentially differ for other model families, sizes and architectures? What specific hypotheses can be tested by evaluating other models?
