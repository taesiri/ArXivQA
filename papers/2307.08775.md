# [GEAR: Augmenting Language Models with Generalizable and Efficient Tool   Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08775)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an efficient and generalizable method for augmenting language models with external tools that allows for scalability to large tool libraries and novel tasks/tools?

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this research question appear to be:

- Proposing GEAR, a query-tool grounding algorithm that enables efficient tool grounding without relying on task-specific demonstrations. This allows scaling to large tool libraries and novel tasks. 

- Using small LMs for tool grounding rather than large LMs to improve efficiency. The grounding is based on semantic and pattern-based scores.

- Evaluating GEAR on a variety of datasets/tasks and tool libraries, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and generalizability compared to prior methods.

- Showing GEAR can improve performance of large LMs like GPT-J and GPT-3 by enabling better tool use.

So in summary, the main research goal is developing a scalable and generalizable approach to augment LMs with tools, which GEAR aims to achieve through efficient grounding using small LMs and semantic/pattern-based scoring. The paper demonstrates and evaluates this approach across different tasks, tools, and LMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GEAR, an efficient and generalizable tool selection method to augment language models. Key highlights:

- GEAR uses small language models (SLMs) for tool grounding/selection, and large language models (LLMs) only for final tool execution. This reduces computational cost compared to relying solely on LLMs. 

- Tool grounding in GEAR is based on semantic similarity of the query to tool descriptions, and pattern similarity of preliminary SLM guesses to tool outputs. This allows generalization to new tasks and tools.

- Experiments show GEAR enables better tool grounding and downstream performance compared to few-shot prompting and prior methods like ART. It also generalizes well to novel tasks, tools, and SLMs.

- Analysis indicates both semantic and pattern scores are important for accurate tool grounding. Using SLMs is shown to be sufficient for this compared to LLMs.

- A GEAR-augmented chatbot is implemented and evaluated positively by users, demonstrating practical viability.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient, generalizable approach to tool grounding and selection in augmented LMs, with empirical analysis demonstrating its benefits. The approach relies more on small vs large LMs.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GEAR, an efficient and generalizable method for augmenting language models with external tools by using small LMs for tool selection and large LMs for execution, achieving strong performance across diverse tasks while reducing computational cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several novel contributions compared to prior work on augmented language models:

- It proposes GEAR, a new method for efficient and generalizable tool selection in augmented language models. GEAR relies on small language models rather than large ones for the tool grounding stage, reducing computational costs. 

- It introduces a tool grounding algorithm based on semantic and pattern similarity scores. This allows comparing tool descriptions to queries as well as tool outputs to expected answers from multiple angles. Prior work like ART relies solely on cosine similarity of embeddings or prompting large LMs, which this work shows can be limited.

- The paper demonstrates GEAR's ability to generalize to new tasks and tools without any fine-tuning or extra demonstrations. Methods like Toolformer can only use tools seen during pre-training. Other in-context learning methods require task-specific demonstrations. 

- Through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, the authors show GEAR enables better tool grounding than prior art, leading to accuracy gains on downstream tasks when used to augment large LMs like GPT-3.

- The work provides the first comprehensive analysis and comparison of different tool grounding strategies, evaluating their accuracy and computational costs. This sheds light on their individual limitations.

In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in tool selection for augmented LMs by proposing a novel grounding algorithm that is more efficient, scalable, and generalizable than prior art. The extensive experiments and analysis provide new insights into designing accurate and affordable tool-augmented language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Combining generalizable and efficient tool grounding (as done by GEAR) with multi-hop reasoning and automatic tool pipeline construction approaches such as ART, Chameleon, and CREATOR. The authors suggest this could further boost the capabilities of large language models.

- Further exploring how mock responses can be used to generalize physical world tools beyond just language tools. The authors tested this with the sleep and movement controller tools, but suggest more exploration is needed especially for embodied language models and robotics.

- Testing GEAR's approach on much larger tool libraries to fully assess its scalability. The authors demonstrate strong generalization capability to go from 4 to 10 tools, but suggest further scale exploration. 

- Applying GEAR in more complex dialog settings and over longer conversations to fully gauge its benefits. The chatbot experiment provides initial promising results, but more extensive testing would be useful.

- Extending GEAR to support conditional tool execution based on user feedback, rather than one-shot execution. This could further improve tool usage accuracy.

- Exploring alternative similarity metrics beyond cosine similarity and pattern similarity to see if further improvements in grounding accuracy can be achieved.

In summary, the key future work is around combining GEAR with reasoning and planning methods, testing on more complex tools and tasks, integrating it into dialog agents, and exploring enhancements to the tool grounding approach itself. The authors provide evidence that GEAR is highly generalizable, but suggest more research is needed to realize its full potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents GEAR, a method for efficiently and generalizably augmenting language models with tools. GEAR relies on small language models (SLMs) rather than large language models (LLMs) to ground a query to the most suitable tool from a tool library. This grounding is based on semantic similarity between the query and tool descriptions as well as pattern similarity between a preliminary SLM guess and tool outputs. After selecting the best tool, an LLM is used just once to generate the API call and execute the tool to get the final output. Experiments across a variety of NLP datasets and tools demonstrate GEAR's efficiency, with 4x lower compute needs than prior work, and strong generalization to new tasks and large tool libraries. Overall, GEAR provides an effective and scalable approach to incorporate tools into LLMs while minimizing expensive LLM calls. Key benefits are the ability to add new tools without fine-tuning and leveraging small models for efficient grounding.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces GEAR, an algorithm for efficiently and accurately selecting appropriate tools from a tool library to augment a language model. GEAR aims to improve upon prior work like CoT, Zero-shot CoT, Toolformer, and others which have limitations in generalization, computational efficiency, or tool extensibility. 

GEAR uses a small language model to score the semantic similarity and pattern similarity between a given query and each tool in the library. This allows efficient scoring of many tools while retaining good accuracy. The highest scoring tool is then executed by the large language model to produce the final response. Experiments across diverse datasets and tools demonstrate GEAR's ability to generalize to new tasks and tools while improving accuracy and reducing computational cost compared to prior methods. A key advantage is avoiding reliance on task-specific demonstrations while still exceeding the performance of other methods that utilize such supervision.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents AGRe (Augment language models with Generalizable and Efficient tool Resolution), a method for efficiently grounding queries to appropriate tools from a tool library without requiring task-specific demonstrations. AGRe calculates a semantic similarity score between the query and tool descriptions using a small language model, as well as a pattern similarity score between a preliminary answer and tool responses. These scores enable query-to-query and answer-to-answer comparisons for comprehensive evaluation. The weighted average of the scores is used to select the most suitable tool. The selected tool is then executed via an API call generated by a large language model to obtain the final response. Compared to prior work, AGRe reduces computational cost and reliance on large models for tool grounding, while improving generalizability to new tasks and tools. The method is shown to enhance performance of GPT-J and GPT-3 across various datasets when augmented using AGRe.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the challenge of teaching language models to effectively utilize external tools and knowledge sources. Specifically, it focuses on improving the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the process by which language models select appropriate tools to apply for a given task or query. 

Some key problems and questions it seems to be tackling:

- Existing methods for teaching language models to use tools rely heavily on task-specific demonstrations, limiting generalizability to new tasks/tools and increasing computational cost.

- There is a lack of understanding around the tradeoffs and limits of different query-tool grounding algorithms like prompting LLMs vs using cosine similarity of embeddings.

- How can the tool selection process be made more efficient by offloading more work to smaller LMs rather than relying solely on large LLMs?

- How can the tool grounding process be made more generalizable to novel tasks and large tool libraries without requiring retraining or finetuning?

- How can both semantic relationship and output pattern relationship between the query and tools be captured to improve grounding accuracy?

- What is the empirical tool grounding performance with different grounding algorithms and LM sizes on a comprehensive set of datasets?

In summary, the key focus seems to be developing a query-tool grounding algorithm that is efficient, scalable, and generalizable without relying extensively on task-specific demonstrations. The paper aims to do rigorous empirical evaluation to demonstrate these capabilities.
