# GEAR: Augmenting Language Models with Generalizable and Efficient Tool   Resolution

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we develop an efficient and generalizable method for augmenting language models with external tools that allows for scalability to large tool libraries and novel tasks/tools?The key ideas and contributions in addressing this research question appear to be:- Proposing GEAR, a query-tool grounding algorithm that enables efficient tool grounding without relying on task-specific demonstrations. This allows scaling to large tool libraries and novel tasks. - Using small LMs for tool grounding rather than large LMs to improve efficiency. The grounding is based on semantic and pattern-based scores.- Evaluating GEAR on a variety of datasets/tasks and tool libraries, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and generalizability compared to prior methods.- Showing GEAR can improve performance of large LMs like GPT-J and GPT-3 by enabling better tool use.So in summary, the main research goal is developing a scalable and generalizable approach to augment LMs with tools, which GEAR aims to achieve through efficient grounding using small LMs and semantic/pattern-based scoring. The paper demonstrates and evaluates this approach across different tasks, tools, and LMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing GEAR, an efficient and generalizable tool selection method to augment language models. Key highlights:- GEAR uses small language models (SLMs) for tool grounding/selection, and large language models (LLMs) only for final tool execution. This reduces computational cost compared to relying solely on LLMs. - Tool grounding in GEAR is based on semantic similarity of the query to tool descriptions, and pattern similarity of preliminary SLM guesses to tool outputs. This allows generalization to new tasks and tools.- Experiments show GEAR enables better tool grounding and downstream performance compared to few-shot prompting and prior methods like ART. It also generalizes well to novel tasks, tools, and SLMs.- Analysis indicates both semantic and pattern scores are important for accurate tool grounding. Using SLMs is shown to be sufficient for this compared to LLMs.- A GEAR-augmented chatbot is implemented and evaluated positively by users, demonstrating practical viability.In summary, the key contribution is an efficient, generalizable approach to tool grounding and selection in augmented LMs, with empirical analysis demonstrating its benefits. The approach relies more on small vs large LMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes GEAR, an efficient and generalizable method for augmenting language models with external tools by using small LMs for tool selection and large LMs for execution, achieving strong performance across diverse tasks while reducing computational cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several novel contributions compared to prior work on augmented language models:- It proposes GEAR, a new method for efficient and generalizable tool selection in augmented language models. GEAR relies on small language models rather than large ones for the tool grounding stage, reducing computational costs. - It introduces a tool grounding algorithm based on semantic and pattern similarity scores. This allows comparing tool descriptions to queries as well as tool outputs to expected answers from multiple angles. Prior work like ART relies solely on cosine similarity of embeddings or prompting large LMs, which this work shows can be limited.- The paper demonstrates GEAR's ability to generalize to new tasks and tools without any fine-tuning or extra demonstrations. Methods like Toolformer can only use tools seen during pre-training. Other in-context learning methods require task-specific demonstrations. - Through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, the authors show GEAR enables better tool grounding than prior art, leading to accuracy gains on downstream tasks when used to augment large LMs like GPT-3.- The work provides the first comprehensive analysis and comparison of different tool grounding strategies, evaluating their accuracy and computational costs. This sheds light on their individual limitations.In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in tool selection for augmented LMs by proposing a novel grounding algorithm that is more efficient, scalable, and generalizable than prior art. The extensive experiments and analysis provide new insights into designing accurate and affordable tool-augmented language models.
