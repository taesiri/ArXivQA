# GEAR: Augmenting Language Models with Generalizable and Efficient Tool   Resolution

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we develop an efficient and generalizable method for augmenting language models with external tools that allows for scalability to large tool libraries and novel tasks/tools?The key ideas and contributions in addressing this research question appear to be:- Proposing GEAR, a query-tool grounding algorithm that enables efficient tool grounding without relying on task-specific demonstrations. This allows scaling to large tool libraries and novel tasks. - Using small LMs for tool grounding rather than large LMs to improve efficiency. The grounding is based on semantic and pattern-based scores.- Evaluating GEAR on a variety of datasets/tasks and tool libraries, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and generalizability compared to prior methods.- Showing GEAR can improve performance of large LMs like GPT-J and GPT-3 by enabling better tool use.So in summary, the main research goal is developing a scalable and generalizable approach to augment LMs with tools, which GEAR aims to achieve through efficient grounding using small LMs and semantic/pattern-based scoring. The paper demonstrates and evaluates this approach across different tasks, tools, and LMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing GEAR, an efficient and generalizable tool selection method to augment language models. Key highlights:- GEAR uses small language models (SLMs) for tool grounding/selection, and large language models (LLMs) only for final tool execution. This reduces computational cost compared to relying solely on LLMs. - Tool grounding in GEAR is based on semantic similarity of the query to tool descriptions, and pattern similarity of preliminary SLM guesses to tool outputs. This allows generalization to new tasks and tools.- Experiments show GEAR enables better tool grounding and downstream performance compared to few-shot prompting and prior methods like ART. It also generalizes well to novel tasks, tools, and SLMs.- Analysis indicates both semantic and pattern scores are important for accurate tool grounding. Using SLMs is shown to be sufficient for this compared to LLMs.- A GEAR-augmented chatbot is implemented and evaluated positively by users, demonstrating practical viability.In summary, the key contribution is an efficient, generalizable approach to tool grounding and selection in augmented LMs, with empirical analysis demonstrating its benefits. The approach relies more on small vs large LMs.
