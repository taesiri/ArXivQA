# [Estimating the Effect of Crosstalk Error on Circuit Fidelity Using Noisy   Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06952)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Crosstalk error is a major source of noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, which can corrupt quantum states and cause incorrect program execution. Characterizing and understanding crosstalk error across different quantum devices is important for mitigating its effects. 

- Prior crosstalk characterization studies often focus on mitigation techniques rather than comprehensively analyzing the intricate dynamics and impact of crosstalk errors across different devices. They also use outdated data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors leverage randomized benchmarking (RB) and simultaneous randomized benchmarking (SRB) protocols to quantify crosstalk errors by measuring the average gate fidelity. 

- They characterize crosstalk error models, daily variation, and comparisons between an IBM Lima 5-qubit and IBM Nairobi 7-qubit device in terms of machine specs, number of qubits, topology etc.

- They evaluate the impact of inserting the highest crosstalk error pairs from IBM Nairobi on the output fidelity of quantum benchmarks, and demonstrate fidelity improvements by inserting instruction barriers.

Key Contributions:
- Validate presence of crosstalk errors on two IBM quantum devices experimentally using RB and SRB protocols.

- Model and evaluate dynamics of crosstalk error rates by comparing variations across machine, specs, topology differences over an experimental week. 

- Demonstrate impact on output fidelity by inserting crosstalk errors, with fidelity improvements up to 3.06x using instruction barriers.

- Provide comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of intricacies of crosstalk errors across different quantum devices using straightforward estimation protocols.

In summary, the paper thoroughly characterizes and evaluates the impact of crosstalk errors across different quantum devices to further the understanding of this major source of NISQ noise for mitigation opportunities.
