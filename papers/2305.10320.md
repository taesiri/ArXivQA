# [CostFormer:Cost Transformer for Cost Aggregation in Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10320)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve the cost aggregation step in learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods using Transformers. 

The key hypothesis is that applying Transformers to cost aggregation can help explore global correspondences and refine ambiguous matching points effectively, overcoming limitations of CNNs like limited receptive fields.

Specifically, the paper proposes CostFormer, a novel Transformer-based cost aggregation network, with two main components:

1) Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) to aggregate long-range features on the cost volume via self-attention along depth and spatial dimensions.

2) Residual Regression Transformer (RRT) to enhance spatial attention before depth regression.

The overall hypothesis is that plugging CostFormer into existing MVS networks can improve their cost volumes and 3D reconstruction performance. Experiments on standard MVS datasets validate this hypothesis, showing improved accuracy and completeness with CostFormer.

In summary, the paper explores using Transformers to improve cost aggregation in MVS, proposing an efficient CostFormer module that brings long-range contextual reasoning to this core MVS step.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes a novel Transformer-based cost aggregation network called CostFormer for multi-view stereo (MVS). The core of MVS is matching corresponding pixels across multiple views of a scene. Previous learning-based MVS methods rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cost aggregation in the cost volume, but CNNs have limited receptive fields and may fail to discriminate incorrect matches. To address this, CostFormer introduces Transformer architecture for long-range cost aggregation. The two main modules are: 1) Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) which aggregates costs along both spatial and depth dimensions in the cost volume via self-attention, enhancing completeness. 2) Residual Regression Transformer (RRT) which applies spatial attention before depth regression, enhancing accuracy. Together these provide global context and refine ambiguous matches. 

However, directly replacing CNNs with Transformers leads to high memory and computational costs. To maintain efficiency, CostFormer employs techniques like shifting windows and multi-scale patch embedding. Experiments on MVS benchmarks like DTU, Tanks & Temples, and ETH3D show CostFormer improves performance over state-of-the-art methods. It can be plugged into existing MVS networks with a modest increase in memory and latency. Overall, CostFormer demonstrates Transformer's benefits for cost aggregation while keeping a balanced trade-off between efficiency and performance. The proposed RDACT and RRT modules are generalizable components to improve learning-based MVS pipelines.

Therefore, the main question addressed is: How to effectively incorporate Transformers into cost aggregation in MVS while maintaining efficiency?

The key contributions are:

1) Proposing CostFormer, an efficient Transformer-based network for cost aggregation in MVS.

2) Introducing Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) to aggregate costs along depth and spatial dimensions.
