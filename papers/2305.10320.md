# [CostFormer:Cost Transformer for Cost Aggregation in Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10320)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve the cost aggregation step in learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods using Transformers. 

The key hypothesis is that applying Transformers to cost aggregation can help explore global correspondences and refine ambiguous matching points effectively, overcoming limitations of CNNs like limited receptive fields.

Specifically, the paper proposes CostFormer, a novel Transformer-based cost aggregation network, with two main components:

1) Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) to aggregate long-range features on the cost volume via self-attention along depth and spatial dimensions.

2) Residual Regression Transformer (RRT) to enhance spatial attention before depth regression.

The overall hypothesis is that plugging CostFormer into existing MVS networks can improve their cost volumes and 3D reconstruction performance. Experiments on standard MVS datasets validate this hypothesis, showing improved accuracy and completeness with CostFormer.

In summary, the paper explores using Transformers to improve cost aggregation in MVS, proposing an efficient CostFormer module that brings long-range contextual reasoning to this core MVS step.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CostFormer, a novel cost aggregation transformer to improve multi-view stereo reconstruction. Specifically:

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes a novel Transformer-based cost aggregation network called CostFormer for multi-view stereo (MVS). The core of MVS is matching corresponding pixels across multiple views of a scene. Previous learning-based MVS methods rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cost aggregation in the cost volume, but CNNs have limited receptive fields and may fail to discriminate incorrect matches. To address this, CostFormer introduces Transformer architecture for long-range cost aggregation. The two main modules are: 1) Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) which aggregates costs along both spatial and depth dimensions in the cost volume via self-attention, enhancing completeness. 2) Residual Regression Transformer (RRT) which applies spatial attention before depth regression, enhancing accuracy. Together these provide global context and refine ambiguous matches. 

However, directly replacing CNNs with Transformers leads to high memory and computational costs. To maintain efficiency, CostFormer employs techniques like shifting windows and multi-scale patch embedding. Experiments on MVS benchmarks like DTU, Tanks & Temples, and ETH3D show CostFormer improves performance over state-of-the-art methods. It can be plugged into existing MVS networks with a modest increase in memory and latency. Overall, CostFormer demonstrates Transformer's benefits for cost aggregation while keeping a balanced trade-off between efficiency and performance. The proposed RDACT and RRT modules are generalizable components to improve learning-based MVS pipelines.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes CostFormer, a novel cost aggregation Transformer to improve learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods. The key ideas are:

1. It introduces Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) on the cost volume to explore long-range dependencies along both depth and spatial dimensions via self-attention mechanisms. This improves completeness. 

2. It further applies Residual Regression Transformer (RRT) after cost aggregation and before depth regression to enhance spatial attention. This improves accuracy while maintaining completeness.

3. The proposed modules are efficient, iterative, and plug-and-play, making them easy to integrate into existing MVS networks like MVSNet and PatchMatchNet. 

4. Experiments on standard MVS datasets like DTU, Tanks & Temples, ETH3D, and BlendedMVS demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art learning-based MVS methods. The method also shows good efficiency.

In summary, CostFormer leverages Transformers to effectively aggregate costs in the cost volume of MVS networks, leading to performance gains while being plug-and-play and efficient. The core novelty lies in the design of RDACT and RRT tailored for cost aggregation in MVS.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of cost aggregation in multi-view stereo (MVS). The core of MVS is matching pixels between reference and source views to estimate depth. Cost aggregation plays a key role in this matching process by regularizing the initial per-pixel matching costs. However, prior methods rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cost aggregation, which have limited receptive fields and may fail to discriminate incorrect matches. 

To address this, the paper proposes involving Transformers in cost aggregation due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, directly replacing CNNs with Transformers leads to high memory and computational costs. 

Therefore, the main question addressed is: How to effectively incorporate Transformers into cost aggregation in MVS while maintaining efficiency?

The key contributions are:

1) Proposing CostFormer, an efficient Transformer-based network for cost aggregation in MVS.

2) Introducing Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer (RDACT) to aggregate costs along depth and spatial dimensions.

3) Introducing Residual Regression Transformer (RRT) to enhance spatial attention before depth regression.

4) Demonstrating CostFormer's benefits when applied to existing MVS networks on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the paper explores using Transformers to improve cost aggregation in MVS in an efficient manner.
