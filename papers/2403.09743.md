# [The Human Factor in Detecting Errors of Large Language Models: A   Systematic Literature Review and Future Research Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper performs a systematic literature review on the research question "Which human factors influence the ability of humans to detect errors made by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT?". As LLMs are being rapidly adopted, including in high-stakes domains like healthcare, their susceptibility to hallucinations poses risks if users cannot spot inaccurate responses. 

The paper follows established guidelines for rigorous literature reviews, searching the Scopus database for relevant papers on LLM errors and human factors in detection. 28 papers across domains like medicine, chemistry and education were analyzed using a concept matrix covering LLM use cases, error types, detection methods and human factors.

Key findings show LLM errors are actively researched, with hallucinations more studied than omissions. Quality testing relies on small numbers of senior human experts, with minimal focus on their attributes influencing detection apart from domain expertise. Personality traits are not considered. This reveals a research gap around human factors in LLM error spotting.

The paper recommends clarifying which use cases are most vulnerable to undetected errors, enhancing technical and human-in-the-loop detection methods, and studying how user attributes and traits affect error identification. This can inform training and best practices for safe, effective LLM adoption, especially where accuracy is critical.

Overall, the paper systematically investigates the current state of knowledge on what enables users to spot LLM inaccuracies. By highlighting research gaps around human factors, it lays the groundwork for further exploration into optimizing human-LLM collaboration and minimizing risks.
