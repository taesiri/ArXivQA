# [Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13637)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: what are the key ingredients for building an engaging, humanlike open-domain chatbot? The authors explore different model architectures, training objectives, datasets, and decoding strategies to identify factors that contribute to improved performance on this challenging task.

The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:

1) Blending skills from different dialogue datasets (personality, empathy, knowledge) into a single model leads to better conversational ability compared to training on a single skill. 

2) Careful choice of decoding algorithm is critical - models with the same perplexity can give very different results depending on the generation strategy used. In particular, controlling the minimum response length is important to balance between dull/unengaging and incoherent responses.

3) Scaling up model size (number of parameters) and training data gives improvements, but other ingredients like skill blending and decoding choices are also very important.

Through extensive experiments, the authors provide recipes to build chatbots that outperform prior work like Meena in human evaluations of engagingness and humanness. The paper thus highlights model architecture, training objectives, datasets, and decoding as key ingredients in building open-domain chatbots.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing recipes for building open-domain chatbots that perform well on engagingness and humanness in human evaluations. The key takeaways are:

1) Blending skills: Large improvements can be made by fine-tuning models on datasets that emphasize particular conversational skills like personality, knowledge, and empathy. The authors show that using the Blended Skill Talk (BST) dataset gives significant gains compared to just using Reddit for pre-training.

2) Generation strategies: The choice of decoding algorithm is critical. The authors find that controlling the minimum length of responses with beam search gives much better results than unconstrained beam search. This prevents dull and unengaging short responses.

The paper shows that large Transformer models fine-tuned on BST with optimized decoding outperform existing chatbots like Meena on engagingness and humanness metrics in human evaluations. The best models are made publicly available.

The authors also analyze limitations and failure cases of their models, showing there are still issues around repetition, factual correctness, and deeper understanding that need to be addressed in future work. But overall the paper provides good recipes for building chatbots that are more engaging and humanlike.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes recipes for building engaging and humanlike open-domain chatbots through large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning on blended conversational skills data, and using careful decoding strategies like minimum beam length; they release 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter models outperforming Meena on human metrics, while analyzing remaining limitations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key aspects of how this paper compares to other related work in building open-domain chatbots:

- It emphasizes the importance of training data and skills beyond just scaling up model size, showing that smaller 90M parameter models trained on the right data can match or exceed the performance of larger 2.7B models trained on less ideal data. This highlights skill-focused training like BST as very important.

- It systematically explores different decoding methods like beam search, showing the importance of controlling response length through minimum beam length. This gives better results than previous work that claimed beam search is inferior to sampling methods.

- It shows retrieve-and-refine models don't clearly beat the best generative models, unlike some prior work. But it does show promise when generative models don't control response length.

- It uses the ACUTE-Eval protocol to directly compare to other models like Meena in a standardized way, whereas prior work often used more custom evaluations. The public model release also enables easier comparison.

- The analysis highlights limitations not exposed by current evaluations, like lack of deep knowledge and repetition over multiple conversations. It tries techniques like unlikelihood training and knowledge retrieval to address them, but more work is needed.

In summary, this paper advances the state of the art in open-domain chatbots by its focus on skills, decoding choices, and reproducible evaluation, while also outlining limitations and future work needed in this area. The public model release also enables the community to build on these recipes.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Continuing to work on fixing remaining issues with current models, such as contradictions, repetitions, and knowledge hallucination. The authors tried some methods like unlikelihood training and knowledge retrieval to address these, but more work is needed.

- Testing models in longer conversations, which would likely expose more weaknesses compared to the short conversations used in the current evaluations. This requires developing good ways to collect and evaluate long conversations. 

- Providing more detailed persona and topic context to help with consistency and introducing talking points over long conversations. The current personas used are very simple.

- Further work on safety and integrity of chatbots, avoiding toxic or biased language. The authors have done some preliminary work on this but more is needed.

- Better understanding the interplay between model perplexity, choice of training data, and decoding algorithms. The authors found model size alone does not determine performance - other factors like fine-tuning objectives and decoding choices are very important.

- Developing better evaluation methods to deeply probe conversational skills like knowledge, contradiction avoidance, and empathy. The current evaluation setups have limitations.

- Exploring long-term memory architectures to allow bots to reference long conversational context and history. Current Transformer architectures are limited in context size.

- Grounding language with world knowledge and embodiment/sensory experience to move towards deeper understanding beyond surface conversational abilities.

In summary, the main directions are improving robustness and consistency, safety, deeper reasoning abilities, better evaluation, and grounding in experience. The authors see current models as still far from truly solving open-domain conversation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper "Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot" presents recipes for building high-performing open-domain chatbots using large neural models. The main findings are:

1. Blending skills by fine-tuning models on datasets for engagingness (ConvAI2), empathy (Empathetic Dialogues), and knowledge (Wizard of Wikipedia) gives large gains over just pre-training on Reddit. Small models with skill blending can match larger vanilla models. Fine-tuning also makes models safer. 

2. Decoding algorithms are critical. Controlling response length, e.g. minimum beam length, is key to making responses less dull/repetitive versus too rambly. Beam search carefully tuned this way can beat sampling methods, unlike some prior work.

3. Larger models (2.7B - 9.4B parameters) with above techniques outperform prior work like Meena in human evaluations of engagingness and humanness. But there are still failure cases around repetition, knowledge hallucination, and deeper understanding. The paper proposes ideas to evaluate and improve on these. Code and models are released to enable further research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper presents recipes for building open-domain chatbots that perform well on engagingness and humanness according to human evaluations. The authors show that large improvements can be achieved by fine-tuning models on data that focuses on desirable conversational skills like personality, empathy, and knowledge. They use the Blended Skill Talk dataset to train models to blend these skills. The authors also show the importance of the decoding algorithm, finding that controlling the minimum length of bot responses is crucial - too short and they seem dull, too long and they waffle. Carefully tuned beam search gave the best results.

Paragraph 2: The authors build and evaluate variants of these recipes using 90M, 2.7B, and 9.4B parameter models. Human evaluations show their best models outperform existing approaches like Meena in multi-turn dialogue for engagingness and humanness. However, the authors discuss limitations - the models still sometimes contradict themselves, repeat phrases, and lack factual knowledge. They tried methods like unlikelihood training and knowledge retrieval to alleviate these issues but results were inconclusive. The authors release their models and code publicly for further research. Overall this work takes a step forwards for open-domain chatbots but many challenges remain.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot":

The paper explores ingredients for building an effective open-domain chatbot using large Transformer-based neural network models. The main method involves pre-training the models on a large Reddit discussion corpus, then fine-tuning them on multi-task dialogue datasets like ConvAI2, Wizard of Wikipedia, and Empathetic Dialogues which focus on critical conversational skills like personality, knowledge, and empathy. The models are trained with standard likelihood loss, but the paper also explores unlikelihood training to reduce repetitive responses. For decoding, beam search with careful tuning of hyperparameters like minimum length is found to outperform sampling methods, in order to balance between dull and spicy responses. The paper shows that properly combining these ingredients - model scale, choice of pre-training and fine-tuning data, training objectives, and decoding algorithms - leads to improved performance on engagingness and humanness metrics compared to prior work when evaluated by humans through conversations.
