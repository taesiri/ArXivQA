# [UTBoost: A Tree-boosting based System for Uplift Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02573)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two novel tree-boosting methods for uplift modeling, which aims to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome for each individual. The first method, TDDP, focuses on maximizing the heterogeneity of treatment effects between groups. The second method, CausalGBM, extends gradient boosting machines to simultaneously fit potential outcomes and treatment effects by optimizing a loss function. Experiments on large real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed methods compared to existing baselines. Specifically, CausalGBM shows strong robustness across varying data characteristics. The authors also develop an open-source package called UTBoost implementing the algorithms, which achieves state-of-the-art efficiency for training uplift trees. Key innovations include approximating the multi-objective optimization problem for computational efficiency and incorporating techniques like histogram-based splitting. Overall, this paper makes notable contributions in extending boosting approaches to uplift modeling and providing an effective and scalable implementation.
