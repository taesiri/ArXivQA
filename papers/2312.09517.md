# [A wearable Gait Assessment Method for Lumbar Disc Herniation Based on   Adaptive Kalman Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09517)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) impairs gait kinematics, but current gait assessment focuses solely on single-source acceleration data, overlooking sensor data diversity and differences in motor function deterioration between healthy and affected limbs. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an LDH gait feature model relying on multi-source adaptive Kalman data fusion of acceleration and angular velocity to estimate attitude angle and segment gait phase. 
- Use 2 IMUs on calves of LDH patients and healthy subjects to analyze 12 gait characteristics across 3 modes: spatiotemporal, kinematic, expansibility index.
- Apply statistical and classification methods to analyze feature model and confirm biological differences between LDH affected side and healthy.

Key Contributions:
- Adaptive Kalman algorithm fusing acceleration and angular velocity to obtain accurate gait phase segmentation and motion attitude for stable state evaluation.
- Analysis of multi-source and multi-type gait features including novel expansibility and kinematic parameters unexplored in previous LDH gait studies.  
- Classification accuracy of 95.5% in distinguishing LDH vs healthy gait patterns using new gait feature sets, enhancing LDH gait abnormality recognition.
- New effective gait feature sets and assessment framework to assist clinical evaluation of LDH patients.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel multi-modal sensor fusion approach for gait analysis in LDH patients. By combining acceleration and gyroscope data, it provides a more comprehensive set of gait features that better characterize LDH gait impairments. The high classification accuracy demonstrates its effectiveness for assisting LDH diagnosis.
