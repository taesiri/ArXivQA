# [Large Language Model Cascades with Mixture of Thoughts Representations
  for Cost-efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03094)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we build a cost-efficient large language model pipeline that leverages both a weaker and a stronger LLM? 

The key hypothesis is that by representing the reasoning process in multiple ways (CoT and PoT) and comparing the consistency of the results, they can build a cascade model that selectively invokes the stronger LLM only when needed to improve accuracy in a cost-efficient manner.

Specifically, the main hypothesis appears to be:

By representing the reasoning process in complementary ways (CoT and PoT) and comparing the consistency of results, we can build decision rules to selectively invoke the stronger LLM only when needed, thereby improving accuracy in a cost-efficient manner compared to using only the weaker or only the stronger LLM.

So in summary, the central research question is how to build a cost-efficient LLM pipeline using both a weaker and stronger LLM, and the key hypothesis is that comparing multiple reasoning representations can help build consistency-based decision rules to selectively invoke the stronger LLM for improved accuracy per cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an approach to combine a weaker but cheaper large language model (LLM) with a stronger but more expensive LLM in a cost-efficient way for reasoning tasks. Specifically:

- They propose a framework called "LLM cascade" that chains a weaker LLM with a stronger LLM. The key component is a "decision maker" module that decides whether or not to invoke the stronger LLM for a more accurate answer to a given question.

- To build an effective decision maker, they leverage multiple thought representations of the same reasoning task, namely proof-oriented thought (PoT) and chain-of-thought (CoT). The key insight is that if the LLMs generate inconsistent answers from different thought representations, it likely indicates the need to invoke the stronger LLM. 

- They design and evaluate various approaches to quantify the answer consistency, including voting-based methods and verification-based methods. The best approach uses PoT and CoT together (MoT), outperforming using either alone.

- Their experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning datasets show that the proposed LLM cascade framework with MoT-based decision maker achieves over 90% of the accuracy of using only the stronger LLM, but with only around 40% of the cost.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective and low-cost LLM cascade framework for reasoning, enabled by leveraging consistency across multiple thought representations to identify the need for the stronger LLM. The results demonstrate significantly improved cost-efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using multiple diverse reasoning strategies with large language models to improve mathematical reasoning while reducing compute costs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper presents a new method for building cost-efficient large language models by cascading a weaker and a stronger model. Most prior work has focused on improving the capabilities of a single large model, so the cascade approach is novel.

- The idea of using multiple diverse prompts and measuring answer consistency is creative. Other papers have explored prompt engineering, but leveraging diversity in prompts specifically to gauge model certainty is a new contribution.

- The experiments cover a range of reasoning tasks and convincingly demonstrate the capabilities and cost savings of the proposed methods over strong baselines. The comparisons to external verifiers are also insightful.

- The analysis and ablation studies provide useful insights into why and how the proposed techniques work. The consistency metric analysis relating performance to reasoning steps is particularly interesting.

- The limitations discussed are reasonable - applicability beyond mathematical reasoning tasks, latency issues, etc. The suggestions for future work seem promising, like incorporating semantic similarity metrics for text generation tasks.

Overall, I think this paper makes excellent contributions to an important emerging area. The core ideas and techniques appear novel, and the empirical methodology and results are thorough and compelling. The cost-performance tradeoffs achieved are impressive. This moves the state-of-the-art forward in developing efficient and scalable large language models. The limitations and future work also indicate good self-awareness of open challenges.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Applying their approach to other types of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as general textual generation tasks. They suggest integrating other metrics like semantic similarity to evaluate consistency in these types of tasks.

- Improving the latency and making earlier decisions for easy or hard questions to avoid always needing the stronger LLM. They suggest establishing a framework for making faster decisions. 

- Exploring how to best represent intermediate reasoning steps for tasks where they cannot be directly expressed as code. They suggest introducing diverse answers by leveraging programming interfaces or tools.

- Incorporating learning algorithms to do weighted voting for combining CoT and PoT answers, since their reliability varies across tasks.

- Further enhancing the pipeline with progressive hints, though they found this was not consistently helpful.

- Choosing the optimal weaker LLM for a given reasoning task, since a LLM that is too weak struggles to consistently solve even simple questions.

- Developing methods to automatically determine the complexity of reasoning questions to help set voting thresholds and determine when the stronger LLM is needed.

In summary, the main directions are improving the approach for new tasks, optimizing the cascade process, representing reasoning steps, weighting voting, enhancing hints, choosing the weaker LLM, and automatically determining question difficulty.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve the cost-efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for multi-step reasoning tasks. The key idea is to cascade a weaker but cheaper LLM with a more powerful but expensive LLM. A decision module determines whether to invoke the stronger LLM based on the consistency of multiple answers generated for a given question. Specifically, the approach prompts the weaker LLM to produce answers using two different representations of reasoning - conversational (CoT) and programming (PoT). If the answers disagree, it triggers the stronger LLM. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets show this approach matches the accuracy of solely using the stronger LLM but with only 40% of the cost. The consistency between CoT and PoT answers acts as an effective indicator of when the stronger LLM is needed.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. The key idea is to chain a weaker but cheaper LLM with a stronger but more expensive LLM using an LLM cascade framework. The core component is a decision maker module that determines whether to invoke the stronger LLM for each question based on the consistency of answers generated by the weaker LLM. Specifically, the authors prompt the weaker LLM to generate answers using two different approaches - chain of thought (CoT) and program-based thought (PoT). If the answers disagree, it likely indicates the weaker LLM is struggling so the question is sent to the stronger LLM. Experiments on 6 reasoning datasets show this approach matches the accuracy of only using the strong LLM while reducing cost by 60% on average.

Paragraph 2: The authors test several methods for answer consistency within the LLM cascade, including directly comparing answers, majority voting, and verifying across different question phrasings/task examples. Combining CoT and PoT representations, dubbed MoT, is found to be most effective. Analysis shows PoT better complements CoT by providing distinct reasoning patterns. Additional experiments explore using GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 as the weaker LLM, leveraging the weak answers as hints for the strong LLM, and replacing the consistency check with an external classifier. However, directly using answer consistency within the cascade framework performs best overall, demonstrating a novel synergy between diverse reasoning and cascaded inference.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach to leverage different strengths of multiple large language models (LLMs) in a cascade framework to improve reasoning performance in a cost-efficient manner. 

The key idea is to first use a weaker but cheaper LLM to generate multiple candidate answers via different reasoning processes (contrastive explanations and code generation). A decision module then measures the consistency between answers generated from different reasoning approaches. If the answers are inconsistent, the question is deemed difficult and transferred to an expensive but more capable LLM for re-solving. Through extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, the authors demonstrate that, compared to using only a single LLM, the proposed cascade approach achieves comparable accuracy but with significantly reduced cost by selectively routing only challenging instances to the stronger LLM. The multi-faceted reasoning also provides more opportunities for detecting inconsistencies. The central hypothesis is that questions which are easy for the weaker LLM will likely have consistent answers across reasoning approaches, while hard questions lead to divergent responses. Empirically validating this, the proposed consistency-based cascade framework is shown to approach the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs but at over 50% reduced cost on mathematical reasoning tasks.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is how to efficiently leverage large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, they are interested in a cost-effective approach that can achieve strong performance by combining a cheaper but weaker LLM with a more expensive but powerful LLM. 

The key questions they are aiming to answer include:

- How can we build a system that uses LLMs more efficiently by avoiding relying solely on very large, expensive models like GPT-3?

- Can we combine a weaker, less costly LLM with a stronger, more expensive LLM in a way that improves cost-efficiency while maintaining strong accuracy?

- What is an effective strategy for deciding when the weaker LLM is insufficient and the stronger LLM needs to be invoked?

- How can prompting the LLMs in different ways, such as with context-oriented thoughts (CoT) versus program-oriented thoughts (PoT), improve the overall performance and cost-efficiency of the system?

In summary, the paper is tackling the problem of how to design a cost-efficient pipeline for large language models to perform complex reasoning while maintaining high accuracy.
