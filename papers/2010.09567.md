# [Solving relaxations of MAP-MRF problems: Combinatorial in-face   Frank-Wolfe directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09567)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes an efficient implementation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving LP relaxations of MAP-MRF inference problems. The key idea is to incorporate "in-face Frank-Wolfe directions" which allows the algorithm to run on smaller "contracted" subproblems. 

2. It defines an abstract data structure for a combinatorial subproblem that enables in-face FW directions. The data structure supports operations like contracting the subproblem by fixing some variables, transforming cached atoms when the subproblem changes, etc.

3. It specializes this abstract data structure for tree-structured MAP-MRF inference subproblems. This allows efficiently implementing operations like contracting the subproblem, adjusting the current solution, and solving optimal transportation problems.

4. It experimentally evaluates the proposed methods on benchmark MAP-MRF inference problems. Results suggest that Frank-Wolfe algorithm with in-face directions is the current state-of-the-art for solving LP relaxations for certain problem classes like protein-folding.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that incorporating in-face Frank-Wolfe directions can significantly speed up solving LP relaxations of MAP-MRF problems for some applications. The paper proposes techniques to enable efficient in-face directions and demonstrates their benefits experimentally.
