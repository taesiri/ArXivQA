# [Answerability in Retrieval-Augmented Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems can retrieve text excerpts that vary in relevance when answering a question. Many ODQA datasets lack examples for identifying irrelevant excerpts. 
- Previous approaches rely on simplistically pairing questions with random text, but models trained this way may not generalize to irrelevant excerpts with high semantic overlap.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate if models trained on random text can recognize semantically related but practically irrelevant excerpts and abstain from answering.
- Explore if models are more likely to hallucinate or incorrectly extract an answer due to confirmation bias when faced with such excerpts. 
- Use ChatGPT to efficiently generate synthetic excerpts that are related or unrelated to questions.
- Train models on unanswerable questions from SQuAD 2.0 to recognize such excerpts.

Main Contributions:
- Show that models trained on random text perform poorly (98% to 1% accuracy) on semantically related but irrelevant excerpts.
- Find that models exhibit confirmation bias and tend to extract factual answers more than other entities when no answer is possible.
- Demonstrate that fine-tuning on SQuAD 2.0 unanswerable questions enables models to achieve near perfect accuracy on recognizing various types of irrelevant excerpts.
- Highlight the importance of abstaining from answering for trustworthy QA systems.

In summary, the paper studies model behavior on irrelevant texts in ODQA using efficient data generation, and shows SQuAD 2.0 fine-tuning is an effective approach to improve performance. Recognizing unanswerable questions is critical for robust ODQA systems.
