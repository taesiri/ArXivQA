# [VIM: Probing Multimodal Large Language Models for Visual Embedded   Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17647)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Visual Embedded Instruction (VISE), a new framework to evaluate the visual instruction following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The key idea is to embed instructions directly into images rather than provide them as separate text. The authors adapt VISE to existing VQA, MME, MM-Vet, and RefCOCO benchmarks across three in-context learning settings - Zero Shot, One Shot, and Pair Shot - composing a VISE benchmark suite. Probing results across open-source MLLMs like LLaVA, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT-v2, and proprietary GPT-4V showcase a significant performance gap, implying subpar proficiency of open-source models in visual instruction comprehension. Further analysis reveals struggles in robust instruction recognition and following. By identifying limitations of current MLLMs in following embedded visual instructions, the work provides useful guidance to advance the field towards more capable multimodal language models with stronger perceptual and reasoning skills grounded in visual contexts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Visual Embedded Instruction (VISE), a new framework to evaluate the visual instruction following capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by embedding instructions into images rather than providing them as separate text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new framework called Visual Embedded Instruction (VISE) to probe the visual instruction following capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). 

2. It adapts VISE to various existing benchmarks like VQA, MME, MM-Vet, and RefCOCO and composes a new benchmark called VISE bench with three evaluation settings - Zero Shot, One Shot, and Pair Shot.

3. It evaluates several state-of-the-art MLLMs like LLaVA, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT-v2, and GPT-4V on the VISE bench and finds that open-source MLLMs lag significantly behind GPT-4V, showing there is room for improvement in visual instruction following.

4. It provides an in-depth analysis of the performance disparity through robustness analysis, instruction recognition, and qualitative observations. The analyses imply limitations of current MLLMs in handling visual embedded instructions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of VISE - a new challenging framework to probe and advance MLLMs' capability on visual instruction following.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Visual Embedded Instruction (VISE) - The main framework proposed to evaluate the visual instruction following capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) - The types of models that VISE aims to probe and evaluate, which have both textual and visual understanding capabilities.

- Instruction following - A key capability of MLLMs that VISE focuses on assessing through visual embedded instructions.  

- In-context learning - VISE adapts VISE through three settings (zero shot, one shot, pair shot) that provide different amounts of in-context examples to guide the models.

- GPT-4V - A proprietary large multimodal model from OpenAI that is compared to open-source MLLMs. It shows much stronger performance on VISE.

- LLaVA, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT-v2 - Some of the open-source MLLM models probed by VISE, which show significant gaps compared to GPT-4V.

- VQA, MME, MM-Vet, RefCOCO - Diverse multimodal datasets that are adapted into VISE formats to build the VISE benchmark.

The key focus is assessing and probing visual instruction following in MLLMs, with the goal of driving progress in this capability. The gaps shown highlight room for improvement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Visual Embedded Instruction (VISE) differ from the standard evaluation paradigms for multimodal large language models (MLLMs)? What unique capabilities does it aim to probe in MLLMs?

2. Why is visual interpretative skill important for an MLMM to succeed under the VISE framework? What specific challenges does visual instruction embedding pose compared to textual instructions?  

3. The paper explores different design choices like instruction location and image resolution when adapting VISE to existing benchmarks. What impact could these choices have on model performance? How were these optimized in the paper?

4. The paper proposes three in-context learning settings - Zero Shot, One Shot and Pair Shot. Explain each of these and discuss why assessing MLLMs across this spectrum is valuable. 

5. While analyzing the results, the paper observes a discrepancy between exact match and partial match evaluations for the One Shot setting. Discuss the tradeoffs between these evaluation criteria and which one you think is more appropriate.

6. The instruction recognition experiment reveals that while GPT-4V excels at this, other MLLMs struggle. Why is the ability to accurately recognize embedded instructions so crucial to success on the VISE bench?

7. The paper unlocks GPT-4V's grounding capability through careful prompting and use of in-context examples. Analyze these approaches - can similar techniques be used to elicit other capabilities in large language models? 

8. Though VISE offers a novel evaluation paradigm, the paper analyzes performance on existing benchmarks like VQA and MM-Vet. What are the advantages and limitations of this methodology?

9. The results showcase a significant gap between GPT-4V and other open-source MLLMs today. What implications does this have on future multimodal research? Where should efforts be focused?

10. The paper states VISE can theoretically be applied to any existing benchmark including pure NLP tasks. Propose two such tasks from the NLP domain that you think would be interesting testbeds for Visual Embedded Instruction and explain your choice.
