# [I Can't Believe It's Not Better: In-air Movement For Alzheimer   Handwriting Synthetic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis suffers from data scarcity issues, limiting the use of data-hungry deep learning models. 
- Synthetic data generation has been used to alleviate this, but more guided generation using domain knowledge is needed.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper explores using AD patients' specific in-air handwriting movements to guide synthetic sample generation.  
- They hypothesize these movements contain discriminative patterns that could generate useful synthetic training data.

Methods:
- A generator RNN is trained to create synthetic handwriting sequences with only in-air movements.
- A discriminator CNN ensemble is used to classify real/synthetic samples.
- Experiments on two handwriting tasks: simple "mamma" writing and complex "bottiglia" reverse writing.

Results:
- For simple task, in-air movement synthesis performs worse than just on-paper movements.  
- For complex task, in-air movement synthesis performs similarly to on-paper after more samples generated.
- Performance gap depends on task complexity and number of synthetic samples.

Conclusions:
- In-air movements do impact model performance, but quality/quantity depends on task and subject's abilities.
- A subject/task-centered approach to synthesis may improve results.
- Highlights the need to explore domain knowledge for improving medical data generation.

Main Contributions:
- First exploration of in-air movement synthesis for Alzheimer's diagnosis.
- Analysis of the impact of task complexity on synthetic sample quality.
- Demonstrates domain knowledge is important for guided data generation in medical applications.
