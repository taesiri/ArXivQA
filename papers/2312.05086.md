# [I Can't Believe It's Not Better: In-air Movement For Alzheimer   Handwriting Synthetic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05086)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using in-air hand movements, recorded when the pen is not touching the writing surface, to generate synthetic handwriting samples for training machine learning models to detect Alzheimer's disease. Since real handwriting data for neurodegenerative diseases is scarce, synthetic data generation is an appealing approach. The authors hypothesized that the increased in-air time exhibited in Alzheimer's patients contains discriminative patterns useful for classification. An existing generative adversarial network architecture was utilized, with one RNN to generate synthetic samples and one CNN discriminator to select realistic samples. Experiments were conducted on two handwriting tasks from a public Alzheimerâ€™s dataset, one simpler and one more cognitively demanding. Performance was measured for models trained with: 1) only in-air movements, 2) only on-surface movements, and 3) both in-air and on-surface movements. Results showed synthetic data from only in-air movements degraded performance compared to no synthetic data, while supplementing real data with synthetic from both in-air and on-surface movements could improve accuracy. Effects were more pronounced for the more complex task. The extreme variability of in-air movements makes modeling difficult, especially for impaired individuals. Overall, the experiments demonstrate in-air movements impact classification, dependent factors are task properties and synthetic sample quality/quantity. More research into generation methods suited for this type of unpredictable data is needed.
