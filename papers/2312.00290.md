# [Learning to forecast diagnostic parameters using pre-trained weather   embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00290)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a two-stage approach to efficiently predict diagnostic weather parameters using only a dense representation of prognostic weather variables. First, an autoencoder is trained to embed high-dimensional prognostic variables into a compressed latent space. This trained encoder is then frozen and used to produce latent representations to train smaller "downstream" models for specific diagnostic parameters like cloud cover and soil temperature. Compared to training bespoke models of equal complexity for each diagnostic variable, this method leads to comparable accuracy while dramatically reducing training and inference costs. For example, downstream models are roughly half the size of bespoke models. The autoencoder only needs to run once to get latent representations for any number of downstream tasks instead of running separate complex models. By avoiding expensive retraining and enabling inexpensive new models, this scalable approach facilitates integrating additional diagnostic weather parameters into operational forecasts.
