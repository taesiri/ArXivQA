# [A Hierarchical Nearest Neighbour Approach to Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09332)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the contextual bandit problem in metric spaces under a fully adversarial setting. The goal is to design an algorithm that achieves low regret against any policy or adversary. A previous algorithm called Nearest Neighbour Bandits (NNB) achieved good regret when contexts are clustered, but performed poorly when many contexts lie near the decision boundary. This is the key limitation the current paper aims to address.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new algorithm called Hierarchical Nearest Neighbour Approach (HNN). HNN is based on the Contextual Best of Neighbours (CBNN) meta-algorithm from the NNB paper. The key idea in HNN is to construct an online hierarchical partitioning of the observed contexts into different "levels". On each trial, it runs nearest neighbour search on contexts at each level of the hierarchy. The algorithm then cleverly combines the nearest neighbours from different levels to pick the action. 

This hierarchical structure allows HNN to eliminate the limitation of NNB on contexts near decision boundaries. Specifically, HNN can exclude any set of "margin" contexts near boundaries when computing the regret. This leads to greatly improved performance over NNB when many contexts lie in margins.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the novel HNN algorithm for contextual bandits that constructs a hierarchical partitioning of contexts in an online fashion

- Provides regret analysis showing that HNN can exclude any set of margin contexts when bounding regret. This helps overcome limitations of prior NNB algorithm.

- Inherits extreme computational efficiency of NNB, with polylogarithmic runtime due to the CBNN meta-algorithm.

- Demonstrates concrete examples where HNN improves significantly over NNB when there are many contexts near decision boundary.

In summary, the key contribution is the HNN algorithm that cleverly utilizes hierarchy and exclusion of margin contexts to advance the state-of-the-art in efficient contextual bandits under adversarial settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new algorithm called HNN for the adversarial contextual bandit problem in metric spaces that improves on prior work by allowing the exclusion of any set of "margin" contexts near the decision boundary when computing the regret, leading to better performance when there are many close contexts across the boundary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an algorithm called HNN (Hierarchical Nearest Neighbour) for the adversarial contextual bandit problem in metric spaces. The key ideas are:

- HNN builds on the Nearest Neighbour with Bandit Feedback (NN) algorithm from prior work, but handles cases where NN performs poorly when there are many contexts near the decision boundary. 

- HNN constructs a hierarchy of "levels" online by associating each trial/context with a depth. It does approximate nearest neighbour search within each level.

- The algorithm chooses which level to use for selecting the action on each round based on the distances to nearest neighbours in each level. This allows it to avoid issues that NN runs into near decision boundaries.

- HNN achieves an improved regret bound compared to NN that does not degrade in cases with many close contexts near the decision boundary. The bound allows flexibility in choosing a "margin" set of contexts to exclude.

- Computationally, HNN retains the efficiency of NN, with polylogarithmic running time per trial under reasonable conditions on the metric space.

So in summary, HNN advances the state of the art for adversarial contextual bandits in metric spaces by improving performance on decision boundaries while maintaining computational efficiency. The hierarchy construction and flexible margin in the analysis are the key technical innovations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Contextual bandits - The paper considers the contextual bandit problem where on each round the learner receives a context and must choose an action, receiving only the loss/reward for the chosen action.

- Adversarial setting - The paper focuses on the fully adversarial contextual bandits problem where no stochastic assumptions are made.

- Metric spaces - The contexts are assumed to lie in an unknown metric space with a distance oracle. Regret is measured against the best policy mapping contexts to actions.

- Nearest neighbors - A key component of the approach is using nearest neighbor searches to identify similar past contexts to generalize from.

- Hierarchical partitioning - The algorithm constructs an online hierarchical partitioning of trials into different levels based on similarity. Approximate nearest neighbors are computed on each level.

- Regret bound - A novel regret bound is proved that allows excluding any set of "margin" contexts near the decision boundary when evaluating the regret term.

- Computational efficiency - The algorithm inherits efficient polylogarithmic running time from the underlying \textsc{CBNN} algorithm when data has bounded doubling dimension.

So in summary, key terms include contextual bandits, adversarial setting, metric spaces, nearest neighbors, hierarchical partitioning, regret bound, computational efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new algorithm called HNN that builds on the CBNN algorithm. What is the key intuition behind HNN and how does it aim to improve over CBNN, especially in cases where there are many contexts near the decision boundary?

2. HNN utilizes the concept of hierarchical nearest neighbors. Explain this concept in detail and how it is used within the algorithm to choose the parent trial Pt for each trial t. 

3. The analysis of HNN involves defining several key sets such as Ct, Ctb, Ctn etc. Explain the significance of each of these sets and how they are used in bounding the regret.

4. A core component of the analysis is showing that |Ctn| is small compared to T. Walk through the key steps used to prove Lemma 6 which shows that |Ctn| ≤ Ψ. 

5. How does the choice of margin M affect the loss bound for HNN? Explain the tradeoffs involved in selecting the margin and why finding the optimal margin is important.

6. HNN has a per-trial time complexity that is polylogarithmic in T. Walk through the key reasons why the computational complexity has this desirable property.

7. The regret analysis of HNN involves defining a hierarchical policy π. Explain how this policy is constructed and why it is important in relating the expected loss of HNN to the comparator losses ξt.

8. In Section 3, the analysis considers what happens when HNN is used in a Euclidean metric space. Summarize the main results here and how they provide further insight into the performance of HNN.

9. Suggest one significant limitation of HNN based on the algorithm description or analysis. How can this limitation be potentially addressed by modifying HNN?

10. The paper cites "Nearest Neighbour with Bandit Feedback" as inspiration. Compare and contrast the key ideas behind HNN with those presented in this paper. What are the main similarities and differences?
