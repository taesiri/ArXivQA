# [Search for or Navigate to? Dual Adaptive Thinking for Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00553)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can an agent flexibly utilize different modes of thinking (search thinking and navigation thinking) during different stages of object navigation in order to improve efficiency and success? The key hypothesis is that using dual adaptive thinking, where the agent switches between search thinking and navigation thinking depending on the stage, will allow the agent to more efficiently locate the target initially using search thinking based on object associations, and then more efficiently navigate to the target location using navigation thinking and memory of the target position.In summary, the central research question is how to design an agent navigation system that can flexibly employ different modes of thinking during object navigation to improve success rate and efficiency. The key hypothesis is that a dual thinking approach will outperform methods relying on only a single mode of thinking.
