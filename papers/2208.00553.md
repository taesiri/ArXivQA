# [Search for or Navigate to? Dual Adaptive Thinking for Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00553)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can an agent flexibly utilize different modes of thinking (search thinking and navigation thinking) during different stages of object navigation in order to improve efficiency and success? 

The key hypothesis is that using dual adaptive thinking, where the agent switches between search thinking and navigation thinking depending on the stage, will allow the agent to more efficiently locate the target initially using search thinking based on object associations, and then more efficiently navigate to the target location using navigation thinking and memory of the target position.

In summary, the central research question is how to design an agent navigation system that can flexibly employ different modes of thinking during object navigation to improve success rate and efficiency. The key hypothesis is that a dual thinking approach will outperform methods relying on only a single mode of thinking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a dual adaptive thinking (DAT) method for object navigation. The key points are:

- The paper proposes the concept of using two different thinking modes - search thinking and navigation thinking - that collaborate adaptively during navigation. Search thinking helps quickly find the target object using object associations. Navigation thinking helps efficiently navigate to the target location after seeing it by encoding the relative target position. 

- The paper designs specific modules for implementing search thinking (using object associations) and navigation thinking (using a target-oriented memory graph and target-aware feature aggregator). 

- Experiments show the proposed DAT method not only optimizes navigation efficiency after seeing the target ("navigate to" phase) but also substantially outperforms existing object navigation methods in overall performance metrics like success rate and SPL.

- The concept of adaptive and collaborative dual thinking provides a new perspective on designing more capable and human-like navigation agents. The idea of using multiple adaptive thinking modes could potentially be extended to other embodied AI tasks as well.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the dual thinking approach for object navigation and demonstrating its benefits over single thinking baselines as well as state-of-the-art methods. The dual thinking concept itself is a generalizable idea that could be useful for other embodied AI tasks too.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a dual adaptive thinking method for object navigation that integrates search thinking to quickly find the target object and navigation thinking to efficiently reach the target location after detecting it, outperforming prior methods that focus only on the search phase.
