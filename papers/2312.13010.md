# [AgentCoder: Multi-Agent-based Code Generation with Iterative Testing and   Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent code generation models still face challenges in balancing high-quality code generation with effective test case design. Single-agent models struggle to excel at both tasks, while having the code and tests generated together leads to bias and lack of diversity in testing.

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper proposes Multi-Agent Assistant Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel multi-agent framework for code generation. It contains three specialized agents:
1) Programmer Agent: Focuses on generating code snippets based on requirements and feedback from the Test Executor Agent. Uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to methodically break down coding tasks.
2) Test Designer Agent: Independently designs diverse, comprehensive test cases for the code produced by the Programmer Agent. Considers basic, edge, and large test cases.  
3) Test Executor Agent: Executes test cases from Test Designer against code from Programmer. Provides feedback containing any errors to the Programmer Agent for further refinement.

Main Contributions:
- AgentCoder framework that achieves superior performance over existing models through collaborative agents with specialized roles.
- Extensive experiments over 9 code generation models and 12 enhancement methods. AgentCoder boosts SOTA performance across metrics. 
- Modular and adaptable design that allows updating individual agents as technologies advance. Provides resilience and longevity.
- Addresses limitations of single-agent models through dedicated test generation, avoiding bias. Fosters feedback loop for progressive enhancement.

In summary, this paper introduces AgentCoder, a pioneering multi-agent code generation framework that transcends constraints of existing methods through purpose-built collaboration between programmer, testing, and execution focused agents.
