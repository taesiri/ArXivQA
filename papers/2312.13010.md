# [AgentCoder: Multi-Agent-based Code Generation with Iterative Testing and   Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent code generation models still face challenges in balancing high-quality code generation with effective test case design. Single-agent models struggle to excel at both tasks, while having the code and tests generated together leads to bias and lack of diversity in testing.

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper proposes Multi-Agent Assistant Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel multi-agent framework for code generation. It contains three specialized agents:
1) Programmer Agent: Focuses on generating code snippets based on requirements and feedback from the Test Executor Agent. Uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to methodically break down coding tasks.
2) Test Designer Agent: Independently designs diverse, comprehensive test cases for the code produced by the Programmer Agent. Considers basic, edge, and large test cases.  
3) Test Executor Agent: Executes test cases from Test Designer against code from Programmer. Provides feedback containing any errors to the Programmer Agent for further refinement.

Main Contributions:
- AgentCoder framework that achieves superior performance over existing models through collaborative agents with specialized roles.
- Extensive experiments over 9 code generation models and 12 enhancement methods. AgentCoder boosts SOTA performance across metrics. 
- Modular and adaptable design that allows updating individual agents as technologies advance. Provides resilience and longevity.
- Addresses limitations of single-agent models through dedicated test generation, avoiding bias. Fosters feedback loop for progressive enhancement.

In summary, this paper introduces AgentCoder, a pioneering multi-agent code generation framework that transcends constraints of existing methods through purpose-built collaboration between programmer, testing, and execution focused agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Multi-Agent Assistant Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel multi-agent framework for code generation comprising specialized agents for programming, test design, and test execution that collaboratively generate and refine code through iterative testing and optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel multi-agent framework called AgentCoder for code generation, which contains three agents - the programmer agent, the test designer agent, and the test executor agent. 

2. Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate that AgentCoder outperforms state-of-the-art code generation models and prompt engineering techniques. For example, AgentCoder achieves 77.4% and 89.1% pass@1 on the HumanEval-ET and MBPP-ET datasets using GPT-3.5, compared to 69.5% and 63.0% for the best baseline methods.

3. Showcasing AgentCoder's superior performance arises from the collaborative synergy between its specialized agents. The division of labor overcomes constraints in single-agent models and establishes an effective feedback loop for progressive code enhancement.  

4. Demonstrating the modular design of AgentCoder provides adaptability and scalability, allowing integration with more advanced models in the future. This positions AgentCoder as a resilient solution in the evolving landscape of automated code generation.

In summary, the key innovation is the multi-agent framework of AgentCoder and its demonstration of improved code generation effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art approaches.
