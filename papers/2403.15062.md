# [Construction of a Japanese Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing need for benchmarks to evaluate large language models (LLMs), especially in specific domains and non-English languages. 
- Currently there are no benchmarks or LLMs focused on both Japanese and finance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a new benchmark comprising 5 tasks specific to Japanese finance: sentiment analysis in financial reports (chabsa), securities analysis questions (cma_basics), auditing exam questions (cpa_audit), financial planner exam questions (fp2), and securities broker exam questions (security_sales_1).

- They measure performance of various existing Japanese LLMs on this benchmark, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Stability AI, Rinna, and others.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of first benchmark focused on Japanese finance, spanning tasks with varying difficulties. Enables differentiated evaluation of LLMs.

- Benchmark measurements showing state-of-the-art performance by OpenAI's GPT-4, and reasonably good performance by some other models like Qwen and Nekomata. 

- Analysis showing benchmark can differentiate model capabilities across performance spectrum. Easy tasks like chabsa differentiate lower tiers while difficult tasks like cpa_audit differentiate higher tiers.

- Publicly released benchmark and model evaluation results to enable further research.

In summary, the paper creates a much-needed Japanese finance benchmark for LLMs, measures performance of various models, and shows the benchmark can effectively differentiate model capabilities across multiple tiers. The public data should facilitate further research in this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new benchmark comprising multiple tasks for evaluating large language models on the Japanese financial domain, tests various models on it, and shows the benchmark can differentiate model performance across all levels by combining tasks of varying difficulty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the construction of a new benchmark comprising multiple tasks specific to the Japanese and financial domains to evaluate the performance of current large language models (LLMs). The paper confirmed that the benchmark could differentiate benchmark scores among models across all performance ranges by combining tasks with different difficulties. The benchmark includes sentiment analysis, knowledge questions, exam questions, and practice exam tasks in Japanese finance. The paper also benchmarked various existing Japanese LLMs on these tasks, finding that the GPT-4 series exhibited overwhelming performance. Overall, the key contribution is the new Japanese finance benchmark that can effectively evaluate LLMs' capabilities in this domain.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Benchmark
- Finance
- Japanese
- GPT-4
- Model evaluation
- Domain-specific tasks
- Japanese financial domain
- Multiple benchmark tasks (chabsa, cma_basics, cpa_audit, fp2, security_sales_1)

The paper focuses on constructing a new benchmark to evaluate large language models on tasks specific to the Japanese financial domain. It measures the performance of various LLMs like GPT-4 on this benchmark across multiple tasks that test things like sentiment analysis, fundamental knowledge, auditing, financial planning exams, and securities sales exams in Japanese finance. So the key terms revolve around LLMs, specialized benchmarks, model evaluation, Japanese finance domain, and the specific tasks included.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper constructs a new benchmark for evaluating large language models on Japanese financial tasks. What were the key considerations and rationale behind selecting the specific 5 benchmark tasks included (chabsa, cma_basics, cpa_audit, fp2, security_sales_1)?

2. The prompts and number of shots used for each model seem to have a significant impact on performance. Can you elaborate more on the prompt tuning process? What guidelines were used to select the best prompts and number of shots? 

3. Table 1 shows the benchmark results across models. What analysis can be done using these results to better understand model strengths/weaknesses and generalization ability? Are certain models better at some tasks than others?

4. The paper argues the benchmark is effective at differentiating model performance across multiple tiers. What specific evidence from the analysis supports this? How do the task difficulties vary and contribute to differentiation?  

5. For practical applications in finance, certain tasks like cpa_audit seem much harder for current models. What steps could be taken to improve performance on such tasks? Would retrieval augmented approaches help?

6. The benchmark currently focuses only on Japanese financial tasks. What considerations would be important if aiming to expand it to cover additional languages or other domains outside finance?

7. The paper references the model Nekomata-14b as performing better on financial tasks than expected. What might explain this? Does it imply pre-training data could matter more than size for specialized tasks?

8. Are there any key limitations of the current benchmark or evaluation approach taken in the paper? What could be improved in future iterations?

9. What insights does the benchmark provide about current model capabilities and limitations in the finance domain? What practical implications does this have for deployment? 

10. The paper focuses on evaluation, but how could the curated datasets be used to actually advance model research? Could the data be used to pre-train new financial-specific models?
