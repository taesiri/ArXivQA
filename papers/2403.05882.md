# [DiffRed: Dimensionality Reduction guided by stable rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05882)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of dimensionality reduction - transforming high dimensional data to lower dimensions while preserving key properties like pairwise distances. It considers two metrics - M1 distortion which measures preservation of variance/energy, and Stress which measures preservation of short and long pairwise distances. The paper aims to develop efficient dimensionality reduction techniques that minimizes both M1 and Stress distortion.

Proposed Solution - DiffRed Algorithm:
The key idea is that for datasets with high "stable rank", random projections are more effective at reducing distortion than PCA directions. Stable rank measures the spread of a dataset - if stable rank is low, the data is concentrated along a few directions. 

The DiffRed algorithm first projects the data along the top PCA directions to explain a fraction p of the variance. Then the residual part is projected using Random Gaussian vectors to minimize M1 distortion. By combining PCA and random maps, and projecting them along orthogonal subspaces, tight bounds are proven on distortion:

M1 ≤ O(√(1-p)/k2) 
Stress ≤ O(√(1-p)/k2))

where k2 is the number of random vectors. This gives a way to tradeoff PCA vs random projections.

Main Contributions:

1. New DiffRed algorithm with a novel way to combine PCA and random maps based on stable rank.

2. Tighter bounds on M1 and Stress distortion incorporating stable rank and other data properties. First work to do so.

3. Extensive experiments showing DiffRed significantly outperforms PCA, random maps etc. on real datasets. Can map a 6 million dimensional dataset to 10D with 54% lower Stress than PCA.

Overall, the paper presents a new perspective to leverage stable rank for guiding dimensionality reduction, and provides useful tradeoffs between PCA and random projections.
