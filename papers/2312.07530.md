# [Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection via Multi-Level Visual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07530)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel weakly-supervised 3D object detection approach, named VG-W3D, that leverages rich 2D image annotations to guide the learning process without requiring any 3D labels. Specifically, it incorporates visual guidance from three perspectives: (1) At the feature level, it aligns image and LiDAR features to focus attention on foreground objects. (2) At the output level, it enforces overlap between projected 3D boxes and 2D detections to ensure accurate localization. (3) At the training level, it generates high-quality 3D pseudo-labels over multiple iterations, using 2D predictions to reduce false positives. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for weakly-supervised 3D detection, showcasing comparable results with supervised methods. Key advantages are the ability to leverage off-the-shelf 2D detectors and the potential for greater scalability. Overall, this multi-level integration of visual cues provides an effective approach for 3D detection that minimizes annotation costs.
