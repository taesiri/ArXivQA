# [Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image   Classification: A Bag-Level Classifier is a Good Instance-Level Teacher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Whole slide images (WSIs) are large gigapixel images used for cancer diagnosis. Their high resolution makes it challenging to directly apply classifiers on them due to GPU memory limitations.
- A common solution is a two-stage multiple instance learning (MIL) approach: 1) Extract patch features using a frozen pretrained embedder, 2) Aggregate features and train a slide-level classifier.
- However, using a frozen patch feature extractor introduces domain shift between natural images and medical images. And the separate training introduces inconsistencies between feature extraction and classification.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose "iteratively coupled MIL" (ICMIL) which iterates between training the classifier with fixed features and finetuning the embedder with guidance from the classifier.
- This iteratively couples the two stages, mitigating domain shift and semantic gap issues in MIL pipelines.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes idea that "a bag-level classifier can be a good instance-level teacher" for guiding embedder finetuning.  
- Develops ICMIL method with two phases iterated:
   1) Classifier Phase: Train classifier with fixed embedder
   2) Embedder Phase: Finetune embedder using classifier outputs as "pseudo-labels" 
- Further uses a teacher-student framework and confidence-based weighting of instances to enhance embedder finetuning.
- Evaluates ICMIL on multiple MIL backbones and datasets, showing consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation is an iterative framework to couple feature extraction and classification stages in MIL frameworks for weak slide-level supervision of WSIs. This mitigates inconsistencies and leads to improved classification accuracy.
