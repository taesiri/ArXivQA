# [Action Inference by Maximising Evidence: Zero-Shot Imitation from   Observation with World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02019)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Action Inference by Maximising Evidence (AIME), a new algorithm for imitation learning from observations. AIME consists of two phases. In the first phase, the agent learns a variational "world model" on its own embodiment data by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). This captures the causal structure relating actions, latent states, and observations. In the second phase, the agent is given expert observation-only demonstrations of a new task. AIME treats policy learning as probabilistic inference, finding an action sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the demonstration under the pretrained world model. Experiments on DeepMind Control tasks showcase that AIME outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot imitation, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and generalization. AIME replicates humans' ability to imitate others by leveraging an understanding of one's own embodiment, without needing online environment interactions or further world model finetuning after observing the demonstration. The results highlight the transferability of learned world models to new tasks.
