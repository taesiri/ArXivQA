# [Adaptive Feature Selection for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment   using Contrastive Mitigating Semantic Noise Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06158)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach called Quality-Aware Feature Matching Image Quality Metric (QFM-IQM) to address the challenge of distinguishing between images with similar semantic content but different quality levels in no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA). The core innovation is a quality consistency contrastive module that selects images with similar features but vastly different quality scores, and uses them as feature perturbations to force the model to isolate quality-relevant attributes from semantic content. Specifically, semantic noise matching first finds perturbed samples, then quality consistency contrastive constraints the consistency of quality predictions before and after perturbation, reducing sensitivity to irrelevant semantic noise. Additionally, a distillation framework provides pseudo-labels to expand the dataset and improve generalization. Experiments on 8 benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Key advantages are enhancing robustness to quality-unrelated semantic noise and focusing more precisely on subtle quality differences among images. The approach provides a new direction for supervised contrastive learning in NR-IQA by addressing the common challenge of distinguishing between distortion levels of images with similar content.
