# [End-to-end Adaptive Dynamic Subsampling and Reconstruction for Cardiac   MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10346)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Dynamic MRI is challenging due to its slow acquisition speed and motion artifacts. Accelerated dynamic MRI techniques using k-space subsampling help address this, but rely on predefined or random subsampling patterns applied uniformly across temporal phases. 
- This overlooks exploiting temporal correlations and adapting patterns to each case. No existing methods perform adaptive dynamic subsampling alongside reconstruction.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an end-to-end pipeline for adaptive dynamic MRI subsampling and reconstruction. It integrates:
   - An adaptive dynamic sampler module that generates case-specific subsampling patterns.
   - A sensitivity map prediction module using a U-Net. 
   - The state-of-the-art vSHARP dynamic MRI reconstruction network.
- The pipeline is trained end-to-end, allowing sampling and reconstruction to leverage cross-phase information.
- Two sampling schemes are proposed:
   - Phase-specific: Distinct patterns for each phase
   - Unified: Single pattern for all phases
- Evaluations compare against fixed, random, and optimized sampling schemes.

Main Contributions:
- First approach for end-to-end learned adaptive dynamic MRI subsampling and reconstruction
- Integrates an adaptive sampler with a sensitivity predictor and reconstruction network
- Considers both phase-specific and unified sampling schemes
- Achieves superior performance to existing methods, especially at high accelerations
- Demonstrates the benefits of adaptive sampling that exploits temporal correlations

The key impact is enabling accelerated dynamic MRI by adapting subsampling to each case alongside reconstruction in an end-to-end manner. This allows exploiting cross-phase information to maximize reconstruction quality. Evaluations highlight the promise of this adaptive approach over existing predefined or random schemes.
