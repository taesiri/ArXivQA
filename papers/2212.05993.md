# [RGBD2: Generative Scene Synthesis via Incremental View Inpainting using   RGBD Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05993)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. Can we develop an effective method for generative 3D scene synthesis from sparse RGBD view observations? The paper introduces a new task of learning to synthesize complete 3D scenes from sparse multi-view RGBD images. 

2. Can diffusion models be adapted to operate on rendered RGBD views for high-quality view completion? The paper proposes using an RGBD diffusion model to inpaint missing regions in novel views rendered from an intermediate scene mesh.

3. Does an incremental view inpainting approach lead to consistent multi-view scene geometry? The method involves progressively generating views along camera trajectories and fusing them to obtain a complete 3D mesh.

4. Can a model trained on RGBD scans generalize to unseen scenes and synthesize geometry and appearance in a scalable manner? The goal is to learn across multiple scenes and apply the model to new scenes with sparse inputs while ensuring scalability.

In summary, the main research focus appears to be on developing a generative scene synthesis approach using RGBD diffusion for view inpainting in an incremental fashion to reconstruct 3D geometry from sparse inputs in a consistent and scalable manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new task of generative scene synthesis from sparse RGBD views. This involves learning across multiple scenes to enable scene synthesis from just a few input RGBD images.

2. It presents a new approach called RGBD^2 that can generate novel RGBD views along a camera trajectory in a sequential manner. The scene geometry is simply the fusion of these generated views. 

3. It uses an intermediate surface mesh for rendering novel views, and an RGBD diffusion model to inpaint missing regions in these rendered views. The mesh helps ensure multi-view consistency.

4. The use of images as the representation makes the method scalable to scenes of varying sizes, and the lack of per-scene optimization at test time makes it efficient.

5. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's ability to synthesize high-quality scenes from very sparse inputs, outperforming existing approaches like NeRF and its variants.

In summary, the key novelty is the formulation of the new task and the proposed RGBD^2 approach that combines meshes, rendering, and diffusion models in an iterative view inpainting framework for consistent generative scene synthesis. The method is scalable, efficient, and produces superior results compared to previous works.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called RGBD2 that reconstructs 3D scenes from sparse RGBD inputs by incrementally generating novel views along a camera trajectory using an RGBD diffusion model and fusing them into an intermediate mesh representation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related works on 3D scene synthesis and view synthesis:

- Compared to neural radiance fields (NeRFs) like Pi-GAN, GRAF, and GAUDI, this paper deals with scene-level synthesis rather than just objects. It also uses a mesh representation rather than a radiance field, which helps ensure multi-view consistency. 

- Unlike NeRF-based methods DDP and RegNeRF that also handle sparse view synthesis, this paper doesn't rely on optimizing a NeRF. Instead, it uses an RGBD diffusion model to inpaint novel views rendered from the intermediate mesh. This is more efficient since it avoids per-scene optimization.

- Compared to NeuralRGBD which learns implicit surfaces from RGBD scans, this paper takes a view completion approach using a diffusion model. The results show it handles very sparse inputs better than NeuralRGBD.

- The proposed RGBD diffusion model is related to recent works adapting diffusion models to 3D like DiffusionPointCloud and Shape2VecSet. But this paper applies diffusion specifically for RGBD view inpainting in a novel scene synthesis pipeline.

- For scene synthesis, this paper focuses on reconstructing geometry and appearance from sparse RGBD scans. It doesn't rely on synthesized datasets or scene graphs like many configuration-based scene synthesis methods.

- The view inpainting approach relates to view synthesis works like InfiniteNature, but those use explicit view interpolation. This paper interleaves inpainting with backprojection for implicit multi-view consistency.

Overall, the paper introduces a new application of RGBD diffusion for sparse view completion in a progressive scene synthesis pipeline. The experiments validate its advantages for handling sparse inputs and efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:

1. Modeling color smoothness and variation, as demonstrated by NeRF. This could help address limitations in handling color discrepancies caused by lighting variations. 

2. Supporting advanced physical lighting effects, such as SVBRDF, as implemented in TANGO. This could lead to more realistic rendering and improved visual quality.

3. Incorporating appearance/surface extrapolation by learning an implicit field, such as NeRF or SDF. This could provide surface extrapolation capabilities currently lacking in the approach.

4. Exploring generative or optimizable camera trajectories for scene synthesis. This could help ensure global consistency for large camera trajectories. 

5. Investigating reconstruction from sparse-view RGB inputs only, using depth inpainting/estimation. This could eliminate the need for depth data.

6. Leveraging large-scale pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion. This could take advantage of their multi-modal or generative power.

In summary, the suggested future directions aim to address current limitations related to lighting/color, surface extrapolation, global consistency, input modalities, and leveraging advanced pre-trained models. The authors propose enhancing the approach through modeling, physical simulation, different representations, camera trajectory techniques, new tasks, and incorporating state-of-the-art models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called RGBD$^2$ for generative 3D scene synthesis from sparse RGBD views. The key idea is to incrementally reconstruct the scene geometry by inpainting novel RGBD views along a camera trajectory using an RGBD diffusion model. Specifically, the approach starts with a few input RGBD views which are backprojected to form an initial scene mesh. This mesh is then rendered to generate an incomplete RGBD view from a new camera pose. The RGBD diffusion model inpaints the missing regions in this rendered view. The inpainted RGBD output is backprojected and fused into the scene mesh to make it more complete. By repeating this iterative process of novel view rendering, RGBD inpainting, backprojection and fusion along many camera poses, the scene mesh gradually becomes more complete. The final fused mesh after all camera poses represents the full reconstructed scene geometry. This approach ensures consistency across views and can effectively hallucinate missing content. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate superior performance over existing methods for generative scene synthesis from sparse RGBD inputs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called RGBD2 for generative 3D scene synthesis from sparse RGBD view observations. The key idea is to incrementally reconstruct the scene geometry by inpainting novel RGBD views along a camera trajectory using an RGBD diffusion model. Specifically, the approach starts with a sparse set of input RGBD images which are fused into an initial scene mesh. This mesh is then rendered from a novel view to obtain an incomplete RGBD image. The gaps in this image are filled in by an inpainting network implemented as an RGBD diffusion model. The inpainted novel view image is backprojected to get a partial surface mesh which is fused into the intermediate scene mesh. By repeating this iterative process of novel view rendering, diffusion-based RGBD inpainting, and partial mesh fusion, the intermediate mesh is progressively completed. The final fused mesh after all novel views have been processed is the full reconstructed scene geometry. 

The benefits of this approach are that it can effectively hallucinate missing scene parts from sparse inputs while preserving visible regions, ensures multi-view 3D consistency through the intermediate mesh representation, is efficient at test time since it doesn't require per-scene optimization, and is scalable to scenes of varying sizes. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate superior performance over existing methods for generative scene synthesis from sparse RGBD inputs. The diffusion-based RGBD inpainting is a key component that enables high-quality view completion while being easy to train on complete RGBD data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach for generative scene synthesis from sparse RGBD views. The key idea is to incrementally reconstruct the scene geometry by inpainting novel RGBD views along a camera trajectory using an RGBD diffusion model. 

Specifically, the method maintains an intermediate surface mesh that is used to render novel partial RGBD views from sparse input views. The incomplete rendered views are then inpainted by an RGBD diffusion model to fill in missing regions while preserving visible areas. The completed views are back-projected to obtain partial meshes that complement the intermediate mesh. By iteratively repeating this process of novel view rendering, diffusion-based inpainting, and back-projection across camera poses, the intermediate mesh is progressively completed to obtain the final scene geometry. 

The use of an intermediate mesh representation enforced by perspective camera projection ensures multi-view consistency. The RGBD diffusion model leverages the generative power and inpainting capability of diffusion models to hallucinate missing scene content at full image resolution. Overall, the approach is able to synthesize complete and coherent scene geometry from very sparse input views.
