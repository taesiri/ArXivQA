# [RGBD2: Generative Scene Synthesis via Incremental View Inpainting using   RGBD Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05993)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. Can we develop an effective method for generative 3D scene synthesis from sparse RGBD view observations? The paper introduces a new task of learning to synthesize complete 3D scenes from sparse multi-view RGBD images. 

2. Can diffusion models be adapted to operate on rendered RGBD views for high-quality view completion? The paper proposes using an RGBD diffusion model to inpaint missing regions in novel views rendered from an intermediate scene mesh.

3. Does an incremental view inpainting approach lead to consistent multi-view scene geometry? The method involves progressively generating views along camera trajectories and fusing them to obtain a complete 3D mesh.

4. Can a model trained on RGBD scans generalize to unseen scenes and synthesize geometry and appearance in a scalable manner? The goal is to learn across multiple scenes and apply the model to new scenes with sparse inputs while ensuring scalability.

In summary, the main research focus appears to be on developing a generative scene synthesis approach using RGBD diffusion for view inpainting in an incremental fashion to reconstruct 3D geometry from sparse inputs in a consistent and scalable manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new task of generative scene synthesis from sparse RGBD views. This involves learning across multiple scenes to enable scene synthesis from just a few input RGBD images.

2. It presents a new approach called RGBD^2 that can generate novel RGBD views along a camera trajectory in a sequential manner. The scene geometry is simply the fusion of these generated views. 

3. It uses an intermediate surface mesh for rendering novel views, and an RGBD diffusion model to inpaint missing regions in these rendered views. The mesh helps ensure multi-view consistency.

4. The use of images as the representation makes the method scalable to scenes of varying sizes, and the lack of per-scene optimization at test time makes it efficient.

5. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's ability to synthesize high-quality scenes from very sparse inputs, outperforming existing approaches like NeRF and its variants.

In summary, the key novelty is the formulation of the new task and the proposed RGBD^2 approach that combines meshes, rendering, and diffusion models in an iterative view inpainting framework for consistent generative scene synthesis. The method is scalable, efficient, and produces superior results compared to previous works.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called RGBD2 that reconstructs 3D scenes from sparse RGBD inputs by incrementally generating novel views along a camera trajectory using an RGBD diffusion model and fusing them into an intermediate mesh representation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related works on 3D scene synthesis and view synthesis:

- Compared to neural radiance fields (NeRFs) like Pi-GAN, GRAF, and GAUDI, this paper deals with scene-level synthesis rather than just objects. It also uses a mesh representation rather than a radiance field, which helps ensure multi-view consistency. 

- Unlike NeRF-based methods DDP and RegNeRF that also handle sparse view synthesis, this paper doesn't rely on optimizing a NeRF. Instead, it uses an RGBD diffusion model to inpaint novel views rendered from the intermediate mesh. This is more efficient since it avoids per-scene optimization.

- Compared to NeuralRGBD which learns implicit surfaces from RGBD scans, this paper takes a view completion approach using a diffusion model. The results show it handles very sparse inputs better than NeuralRGBD.

- The proposed RGBD diffusion model is related to recent works adapting diffusion models to 3D like DiffusionPointCloud and Shape2VecSet. But this paper applies diffusion specifically for RGBD view inpainting in a novel scene synthesis pipeline.

- For scene synthesis, this paper focuses on reconstructing geometry and appearance from sparse RGBD scans. It doesn't rely on synthesized datasets or scene graphs like many configuration-based scene synthesis methods.

- The view inpainting approach relates to view synthesis works like InfiniteNature, but those use explicit view interpolation. This paper interleaves inpainting with backprojection for implicit multi-view consistency.

Overall, the paper introduces a new application of RGBD diffusion for sparse view completion in a progressive scene synthesis pipeline. The experiments validate its advantages for handling sparse inputs and efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
