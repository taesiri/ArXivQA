# [Integrating Large Language Models in Causal Discovery: A Statistical   Causal Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Statistical causal discovery (SCD) methods rely heavily on assumptions and can produce inaccurate causal graphs without domain knowledge. However, systematically acquiring and incorporating domain knowledge into SCD algorithms is challenging.

- Datasets for causal inference often have biases and limitations that further challenge pure data-driven approaches.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new methodology that integrates SCD methods with large language model (LLM) based knowledge for causal inference. 

- Use an LLM like GPT-4 to generate domain knowledge on causal relationships between variables. This knowledge is converted to "prior knowledge" constraints and input to SCD methods.

- Additionally propose "statistical causal prompting" (SCP) where SCD results are provided as context to the LLM when generating the domain knowledge. This is hypothesized to improve the quality of the LLM's domain knowledge.

Main Contributions:

1) Demonstrate a practical implementation that combines LLM-based causal inference and SCD algorithms in a mutually beneficial way.

2) Show through experiments that SCP enhances both the LLM's domain knowledge and the final accuracy of the SCD methods.

3) Demonstrate the approach works even when the SCD dataset is not part of the LLM's training data. This illustrates the potential to improve data-driven causal inference across scientific domains.

4) The approach can produce superior causal models compared to without LLM guidance, even when datasets are biased. This helps address limitations of pure data-driven causal discovery.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective integration of LLMs and SCD that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and knowledge-driven causal inference to produce higher quality and more robust causal models.
