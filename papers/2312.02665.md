# [Lights out: training RL agents robust to temporary blindness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02665)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose a novel deep reinforcement learning method to train agents that are robust to temporary lack of state observations, or "blindness". They introduce a neural network architecture that encodes state observations into latent representations and uses an LSTM to make open-loop action selections based on those embeddings over multiple timesteps. Along with this, they contribute a specialized multi-step loss function to train the network to accurately predict future rewards and values after taking actions without access to updated state inputs. Through experiments in gridworld environments with different blindness masks, they demonstrate that their method can enable agents to reliably traverse blinded areas much longer than the lengths seen during training. Key results show the agent successfully switching between closed and open-loop control to solve mazes, as well as generalizing to blindness stretches over twice as long as the open-loop sequences it was trained on. While more extensive testing is needed, the method displays promise in improving robustness to temporary lack of observations in deep RL agents. The loss function specifically stands out for its ability to ground open-loop predictions to match closed-loop performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel loss function and neural network architecture that trains a Deep Q-Network agent to be robust to temporary lack of access to state observations by learning to switch between closed-loop and open-loop control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors contribute a novel loss function based on DQN that successfully trains a recurrent neural network to learn both a closed-loop and open-loop policy that is robust to not having access to state observations during evaluation. Specifically, it can withstand blindness stretches longer than the ones it was trained on, demonstrating robustness to temporary blindness. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first application of such an open-loop loss function to the online deep reinforcement learning setting, allowing the agent to learn while exploring a novel task.

In summary, the key contributions are:

1) A new loss function for training a DQN agent that can handle both closed-loop and open-loop control
2) Applying this method to train an online RL agent robust to lack of state observations (temporary blindness)
3) Demonstrating this method allows the agent to operate during blindness periods longer than what it was trained on

Does this accurately capture the main contribution? Let me know if you have any other questions!


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Reinforcement learning
- Deep Q-networks (DQN) 
- Observation robustness
- Closed-loop control
- Open-loop control
- State embeddings
- $n$-step loss function
- Distribution shift
- Robustness to temporary blindness
- Gridworld maze environment

The paper proposes a method to train a DQN agent that can switch between closed-loop and open-loop control by using a recurrent neural network architecture and a novel $n$-step loss function. This allows the agent to be robust to situations where state observations are temporarily unavailable or missing (i.e. temporary blindness). Experiments are conducted in gridworld maze environments with different blindness masks to evaluate the approach. Key results show the agent can handle blindness stretches longer than what it was trained on, demonstrating some generalization ability. The impact of key hyperparameters and different maze challenges on performance are also analyzed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel loss function for training a DQN agent to be robust to temporary blindness. Can you explain in detail how this loss function works and how it enables the agent to perform open-loop control when blinded? 

2. The architecture uses an encoder and an LSTM to generate state embeddings. What is the purpose of using state embeddings instead of the actual states? How do the encoder and LSTM allow the agent to make predictions about future states?

3. The paper evaluates the performance of agents on two different mazes under various blindness conditions. What were the key findings from these experiments in terms of how well the agents could deal with being blinded? What hyperparameters and architectural choices affected performance the most?

4. The loss function includes an n-step target value loss and a reward prediction loss. What is the purpose of each of these loss terms? How do they enable the agent to accurately estimate values and rewards while blinded? 

5. The paper argues that there may be distribution shift issues when training the open-loop policy on closed-loop trajectories. How exactly could this distribution shift manifest? Why didn't it seem to be a major issue in the experiments done in this paper?

6. What were some of the key limitations of the experiments performed, in terms of statistical power and ability to draw strong conclusions? How could the experimental methodology be improved in future work? 

7. The paper briefly mentions the possibility of the open-loop controller getting stuck repeating actions while blinded. What could be the reasons for this, and how might the architecture or training approach be modified to address it?

8. How well do you think the approach presented in this paper would scale to more complex, high-dimensional environments like Atari games or robotics simulations? What changes would need to be made?

9. The paper focuses on dealing with blindness, but how do you think this approach could be extended to deal with other types of observation disturbances like sensor noise or occlusion? Would the same ideas apply?

10. Do you think that incorporating model-based elements through the state embeddings provides advantages over pure model-free methods when handling disturbances to observations? Why or why not?
