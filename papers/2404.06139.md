# [DiffHarmony: Latent Diffusion Model Meets Image Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image harmonization involves adjusting the foreground of a composite image to match the background and achieve visual consistency. This can be viewed as an image-to-image translation task where recent diffusion models have shown great promise. However, training diffusion models from scratch requires enormous compute resources. Alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained latent diffusion models is challenging due to the reconstruction error induced by the image compression autoencoder used.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes DiffHarmony, an image harmonization model adapted from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion latent diffusion model. To address the image distortion issue, two strategies are used - 1) Utilizing higher-resolution images during inference to generate clearer initial harmonizations 2) Incorporating an additional refinement stage with a UNet to further enhance image clarity.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes modifications to allow pre-trained latent diffusion models to achieve state-of-the-art results on the image harmonization task
- Analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of applying latent diffusion models to harmonization, providing insights for future work
- Demonstrates superior performance to previous methods on the iHarmony4 benchmark, especially on subsets with limited training data
- Shows the potential of the approach by training a SOTA model with higher resolution images, nearing performance of DiffHarmony

In summary, this paper demonstrates how to successfully adapt latent diffusion models for image harmonization through simple but effective strategies to address reconstruction errors. Detailed experiments provide analysis to guide future research in this direction.
