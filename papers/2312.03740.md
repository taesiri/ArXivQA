# [Prompting in Autoregressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise for various NLP tasks. However, harnessing their full potential is challenging due to their massive size, making fine-tuning infeasible. 
- Prompting has emerged as a technique to guide LLM outputs without fine-tuning, but more research is needed to develop optimal prompting methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a taxonomy of existing literature on prompting techniques for autoregressive LLMs. 
- Prompts are categorized based on level of human involvement (hand-crafted vs automated) and type (task-based, generate-auxiliary, resource/tools augmented).
- A concise survey is presented of research efforts within each taxonomy branch.

Key Contributions:
- A novel taxonomy that structures the growing body of research on prompting autoregressive LLMs.
- An analysis of hand-crafted and automated prompts based on discrete vs continuous optimization.
- A discussion of innovative prompts like chain-of-thought, self-consistency and tools-augmented prompts. 
- Identification of open problems related to sub-optimal prompts, structured data handling and prompt injection attacks.

In summary, the paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy and review of prompting techniques for LLMs to guide future research towards realizing their full potential. Key open problems are highlighted as potential areas of further investigation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a taxonomy and survey of prompting techniques for guiding the output of autoregressive large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing a taxonomy-based survey of existing literature on prompting techniques for autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- The paper proposes an area taxonomy to categorize different prompting methods based on two key dimensions: human effort in prompt creation and the type/purpose of prompts.

- It provides a comprehensive overview of existing research on prompting techniques, structured according to the proposed taxonomy. This includes a discussion of hand-crafted vs automated prompts, as well as a breakdown of prompts by their intended objectives (task-based, generate-auxiliary, resource/tools augmented). 

- The paper summarizes some of the key open problems and future research directions in the field of prompting LLMs, including addressing sub-optimal prompts, handling structured data, improving answer engineering, and preventing prompt injection attacks.

In essence, the main contribution is a structured taxonomy and literature review that organizes the growing body of research on prompting techniques for guiding the behavior and enhancing the performance of autoregressive LLMs. The discussion of open problems and future work is also a notable contribution that can inform continued research in this space.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses a taxonomy for classifying prompting methods in autoregressive language models. What are the key dimensions used in this taxonomy and what are the categories within each dimension? Explain the rationale behind this taxonomy.

2. The paper talks about "emergent abilities" of large language models that manifest due to increases in model scale. What are some examples of these abilities? How do techniques like chain of thought prompting seek to leverage these abilities?

3. Continuous prompts involve optimizing a small set of parameters rather than the full language model. What are some of the advantages and limitations of this approach? Under what conditions might continuous prompts become infeasible?

4. The paper discusses "answer engineering" as an open challenge in prompting research. What does answer engineering refer to and why is it difficult? What are some existing techniques to address this and what are their limitations?

5. Resource and tools augmented prompting integrates external components like search engines. What are some examples of research works that take this approach? What are the benefits and what aspects need further research? 

6. What is prompt injection and why does it pose risks, especially for publicly deployed models? Give examples of potential prompt injection attacks. What solutions have been proposed and what are their limitations?

7. Explain the key ideas behind techniques like chain of thought prompting and self-consistency. How do they differ and what problem do they address? What are advantages and disadvantages?

8. What is the core motivation behind exploring automated prompting techniques? What are differences in methodology between approaches that generate discrete vs continuous prompts?

9. How can reinforcement learning be utilized for optimizing prompts automatically? Explain the approach taken in a technique like RLPrompt highlighting how the prompt policy is trained.

10. The paper argues prompting struggles to handle diverse structured inputs beyond plain text. What are some types of structures that remain challenging? What techniques show promise for graph or table inputs? What advances are needed?
