# [Prompting in Autoregressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise for various NLP tasks. However, harnessing their full potential is challenging due to their massive size, making fine-tuning infeasible. 
- Prompting has emerged as a technique to guide LLM outputs without fine-tuning, but more research is needed to develop optimal prompting methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a taxonomy of existing literature on prompting techniques for autoregressive LLMs. 
- Prompts are categorized based on level of human involvement (hand-crafted vs automated) and type (task-based, generate-auxiliary, resource/tools augmented).
- A concise survey is presented of research efforts within each taxonomy branch.

Key Contributions:
- A novel taxonomy that structures the growing body of research on prompting autoregressive LLMs.
- An analysis of hand-crafted and automated prompts based on discrete vs continuous optimization.
- A discussion of innovative prompts like chain-of-thought, self-consistency and tools-augmented prompts. 
- Identification of open problems related to sub-optimal prompts, structured data handling and prompt injection attacks.

In summary, the paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy and review of prompting techniques for LLMs to guide future research towards realizing their full potential. Key open problems are highlighted as potential areas of further investigation.
