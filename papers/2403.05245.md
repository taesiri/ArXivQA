# [Noise Level Adaptive Diffusion Model for Robust Reconstruction of   Accelerated MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion model based MRI reconstruction methods work by incrementally removing noise from images while imposing data consistency with the acquired k-space measurements. 
- However, the actual MRI measurements already contain inherent noise due to hardware limitations and thermal fluctuations.
- As the artificial noise is removed during diffusion reconstruction, this MRI measurement noise becomes more pronounced and interferes with the predefined noise schedule used to train diffusion models.
- This can lead to poor performance or failure of diffusion reconstruction methods, especially in cases of low-field MRI, fMRI, DWI etc which have higher noise levels.

Proposed Solution:
- A new noise level adaptive data consistency (Nila-DC) operation is proposed. 
- This adaptively rescales the data consistency term using an attenuation function based on the estimated noise level of the measurements (sigma_y).
- The attenuation ensures robust guidance from the k-space data while preventing interference of MRI noise with the diffusion model's predefined denoising schedule.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of MRI measurement noise issue for diffusion MRI reconstruction methods.
- Formulation of how this noise interferes with the reverse diffusion process.  
- Introduction of an adaptive data consistency operation (Nila-DC) to address this issue through a noise level attenuation function.
- Validation of the proposed method on multiple public and clinical datasets with varying field strengths and imaging contrasts.
- Demonstration of superior reconstruction quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, especially under high noise levels.
- Additional demonstration of successful reconstruction on prospectively undersampled diffusion weighted MRI data.

In summary, the key innovation is an adaptive data consistency operation that makes diffusion model based MRI reconstruction robust to various real-world noise levels by preventing interference with predefined denoising schedules.
