# [LLM Calibration and Automatic Hallucination Detection via Pareto Optimal   Self-supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be developing and evaluating a framework for LLM calibration and automatic hallucination detection via Pareto optimal self-supervision. Specifically, the key ideas seem to be:1. Proposing a method called Pareto optimal self-supervision to systematically calibrate LLM responses by producing a risk score for each response, without needing additional manual labeling efforts. This is done by learning a harmonizer model that aligns the LLM output with other available supervision sources.2. Introducing a risk score called POLAR (Pareto optimal learning assessed risk) that assigns higher scores to more uncertain LLM responses to facilitate error detection and correction.3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed POLAR scores are highly correlated with the real error rates of LLMs on relation extraction tasks. Also showing improved LLM accuracy via dynamic prompting based on the POLAR scores.In summary, the main hypothesis appears to be that Pareto optimal self-supervision can effectively calibrate LLMs and detect potential hallucinations or errors automatically, as quantified by the proposed POLAR score. The experiments seem designed to validate that the POLAR score is well-calibrated and enables techniques like dynamic prompting to correct LLM errors.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be developing an approach for calibrating the confidence of large language model (LLM) responses and automatically detecting errors, without requiring additional manual labeling efforts. Specifically, the key ideas seem to be:- Leveraging available programmatic supervision sources (like simple rules, keywords, knowledge bases etc.) as a source of weak signals for calibrating LLM responses.- Fitting a harmonizer model using Pareto optimal learning to align with both the LLM responses and the other weak supervision sources. - Using the disagreement between the harmonizer and the LLM on a given response to assign a risk score, with higher disagreement indicating higher chance of LLM error.- Demonstrating that the proposed risk scores correlate well with actual LLM error rates on held-out test sets across different datasets.- Showing improved LLM accuracy via dynamic prompting strategies guided by the proposed risk scores.So in summary, the main research contribution appears to be developing a methodology for self-supervised LLM calibration and error detection using Pareto optimal learning over the LLM and weak supervision sources, without needing additional human labeling efforts.
