# [LLM Calibration and Automatic Hallucination Detection via Pareto Optimal   Self-supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be developing and evaluating a framework for LLM calibration and automatic hallucination detection via Pareto optimal self-supervision. Specifically, the key ideas seem to be:1. Proposing a method called Pareto optimal self-supervision to systematically calibrate LLM responses by producing a risk score for each response, without needing additional manual labeling efforts. This is done by learning a harmonizer model that aligns the LLM output with other available supervision sources.2. Introducing a risk score called POLAR (Pareto optimal learning assessed risk) that assigns higher scores to more uncertain LLM responses to facilitate error detection and correction.3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed POLAR scores are highly correlated with the real error rates of LLMs on relation extraction tasks. Also showing improved LLM accuracy via dynamic prompting based on the POLAR scores.In summary, the main hypothesis appears to be that Pareto optimal self-supervision can effectively calibrate LLMs and detect potential hallucinations or errors automatically, as quantified by the proposed POLAR score. The experiments seem designed to validate that the POLAR score is well-calibrated and enables techniques like dynamic prompting to correct LLM errors.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be developing an approach for calibrating the confidence of large language model (LLM) responses and automatically detecting errors, without requiring additional manual labeling efforts. Specifically, the key ideas seem to be:- Leveraging available programmatic supervision sources (like simple rules, keywords, knowledge bases etc.) as a source of weak signals for calibrating LLM responses.- Fitting a harmonizer model using Pareto optimal learning to align with both the LLM responses and the other weak supervision sources. - Using the disagreement between the harmonizer and the LLM on a given response to assign a risk score, with higher disagreement indicating higher chance of LLM error.- Demonstrating that the proposed risk scores correlate well with actual LLM error rates on held-out test sets across different datasets.- Showing improved LLM accuracy via dynamic prompting strategies guided by the proposed risk scores.So in summary, the main research contribution appears to be developing a methodology for self-supervised LLM calibration and error detection using Pareto optimal learning over the LLM and weak supervision sources, without needing additional human labeling efforts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for calibrating large language model (LLM) responses and detecting hallucination using Pareto optimal self-supervision, without requiring labeled training data. The key ideas are:1. Fit a harmonizer model to be consistent with both the LLM response and other weak supervision sources like heuristics and knowledge bases, through Pareto optimal learning.2. Use the harmonizer to assign a risk score called POLAR (Pareto Optimal Learning Assessed Risk) to each LLM response. Responses that significantly deviate from the harmonizer prediction receive higher risk scores.3. Show through experiments that the proposed POLAR score is well calibrated with the actual error rate of LLMs, allowing it to accurately detect potential hallucination and uncertainties.4. Demonstrate that POLAR-assisted dynamic prompting techniques can significantly improve LLM accuracy on high risk examples, boosting off-the-shelf GPT-3 performance past state-of-the-art weak supervision methods and GPT-4 past state-of-the-art supervised methods, without using any labeled training data.In summary, the main contribution is developing a novel self-supervised framework for calibrating LLMs and detecting hallucination via Pareto optimal learning, with promising results demonstrated. The proposed method provides a valuable capability for reliably applying LLMs to mission-critical domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here is a summary of the main contributions of the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework for calibrating and detecting errors in large language model (LLM) outputs using Pareto optimal self-supervision, without needing any manually labeled data. The key ideas are:- Fit a "harmonizer" model to be simultaneously consistent with the LLM outputs and other weak supervision sources like heuristics rules and knowledge bases. This is done via Pareto optimization.- The harmonizer model produces a "POLAR" (Pareto Optimal Learning Assessed Risk) score that estimates the probability of error for a given LLM output. - Experiments on relation extraction tasks show the POLAR score is well calibrated with actual LLM error rates. High POLAR scores accurately detect incorrect LLM outputs.- Using the POLAR score for dynamic prompting improves LLM accuracy, boosting GPT-3 and GPT-4 results past state-of-the-art methods that use full supervision.In summary, the main contribution is a self-supervised framework to calibrate LLMs and detect errors without manual labeling, by fitting a harmonizer model via Pareto optimization. The POLAR scores from this framework are shown to be well calibrated, and enable improving LLM accuracy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the main points from the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Pareto optimal self-supervision that uses unlabeled data and weak supervision sources to learn a harmonizer model for calibrating the confidence of large language model (LLM) predictions, as measured by a proposed risk score called POLAR. Experiments on relation extraction tasks show the POLAR score is highly correlated with LLM error rate and enables improved performance via prompting techniques.
