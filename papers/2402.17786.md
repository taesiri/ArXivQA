# [Stepwise Self-Consistent Mathematical Reasoning with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Using large language models (LLMs) for complex mathematical reasoning is challenging primarily due to the complexity of multi-step reasoning. 
- Two main challenges: (1) selecting critical intermediate results to advance the reasoning procedure, and (2) limited exploration of potential solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel algorithm called Stepwise Self-Consistent Chain-of-Thought (SSC-CoT).
- SSC-CoT employs a strategy of selecting intermediate steps based on the intersection of various reasoning chains. This helps choose critical steps to advance the reasoning.
- It enables the model to discover critical intermediate steps by querying a Knowledge Graph (KG) comprising relevant domain knowledge. This allows more exploration of solutions.

Key Contributions:
- Proposal of SSC-CoT algorithm that significantly improves LLMs' capabilities in identifying critical intermediate steps for mathematical problem solving.
- Procedure to establish a KG and allow LLM to efficiently retrieve information in textual form, facilitating generation of critical intermediate results.  
- Introduction of new dataset "TriMaster100" tailored for complex trigonometry problems to evaluate intermediate results in mathematical reasoning.
- Benchmarking of SSC-CoT against state-of-the-art methods on TriMaster100 and MATH datasets, where SSC-CoT significantly outperforms others in solving complex questions.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in enhancing LLMs' mathematical reasoning for complex problems by effectively identifying critical intermediate steps and expanding exploration of solutions using the SSC-CoT algorithm and knowledge retrieval from a graph.
