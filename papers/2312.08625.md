# [Graph Network Surrogate Model for Subsurface Flow Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08625)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a graph network surrogate model (GNSM) to predict pressure and saturation responses over time in subsurface flow systems with shifting well locations and controls. Separate graph networks are constructed for the pressure and saturation variables using an encoding-processing-decoding architecture applied to a computational graph representation of the reservoir model. Key features enhancing model accuracy include incorporation of a single-phase steady state pressure solution and specialized treatment of well blocks. A multistage multistep training strategy limits error accumulation over successive rollout steps. Test cases involving 300 randomly generated 10-well configurations and controls in a 2D unstructured channelized model yield median errors around 1-2% in predicted state variables and 4-7% in well rates. The optimized GNSM provides a 36x speedup for well placement optimization versus direct simulation. Comparable optimization results are achieved using the GNSM surrogate versus simulations. Extrapolation capability is demonstrated by testing on a permeability realization derived from the same training image without retraining. Overall, the study demonstrates the promise of physics-based deep learning surrogates for accelerating multiphase flow optimization problems involving shifting well locations and controls.
