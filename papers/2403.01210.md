# [SAR-AE-SFP: SAR Imagery Adversarial Example in Real Physics domain with   Target Scattering Feature Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for SAR image recognition are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 
- Existing attack methods either operate in the 2D digital image domain (not physically realizable) or fail to properly account for the SAR imaging process (termed "pseudo physics" attacks).
- There is a need for a method to generate "real physics" adversarial examples by altering the actual physical properties of targets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose SAR-AE-SFP-Attack - a method to generate adversarial examples by perturbing the scattering feature parameters (reflectivity, roughness, etc) of 3D target models.
- They use the RaySAR simulator to physically simulate the SAR imaging process under the perturbed parameters.
- They optimize the parameters using a custom finite difference method to estimate gradients and batch processing for efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- First attack method that operates by altering scattering properties of real 3D targets.
- Achieves over 30% attack improvement on CNNs and 13% on Transformers versus other methods.
- Demonstrates attack transferability across models and view angles.
- Addresses non-differentiability of simulator through proposed gradient estimation approach.
- Overall, enables generation of real-world viable physical adversarial examples against SAR image recognition.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to craft physically-realizable adversarial attacks for SAR image recognition models by optimizing scattering parameters of targets through simulation. Key results show higher attack success rates and transferability compared to prior digital-domain attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an end-to-end method called SAR-AE-SFP-Attack to generate physically realizable adversarial examples for SAR imagery by iteratively optimizing the scattering feature parameters of 3D target models using a ray-tracing based SAR simulator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an end-to-end method called SAR-AE-SFP-Attack to generate real physics adversarial examples for SAR images by perturbing the scattering feature parameters of 3D target objects. Specifically:

1) It integrates the SAR imaging mechanism into the adversarial example generation process. By adjusting the scattering feature parameters of the target object in a SAR image simulator, it changes the target echo intensity to obtain adversarial examples after imaging processing. 

2) It proposes an optimization approach using differential substitution to address the non-differentiability issue of the SAR simulator. This effectively estimates gradients and efficiently optimizes the adversarial scattering feature parameters of the target object.

3) Extensive experiments show SAR-AE-SFP-Attack achieves higher attack effectiveness and transferability across different models and viewpoints compared to other general attack methods.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an end-to-end pipeline to generate real physics adversarial examples for SAR imagery by perturbing scattering features of target objects, which demonstrates potential for physical world attacks.
