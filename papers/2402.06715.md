# [Learning-augmented Online Algorithm for Two-level Ski-rental Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the two-level ski-rental problem where a user needs to fulfill demands for multiple items over time by choosing between renting, buying individual items (single purchase) or buying a bundle of items (combo purchase). The goal is to minimize the total cost by balancing the tradeoff between expensive upfront purchase costs and potential future rental expenses, without knowing future demands. 

Proposed Solution:

1. The paper designs a robust online algorithm called RDTSR that makes rental/purchase decisions solely based on past demands. RDTSR is proven to achieve a competitive ratio of 3, outperforming prior arts. 

2. To improve upon RDTSR's average-case performance while retaining worst-case guarantees, the paper develops a learning-augmented algorithm called LADTSR by incorporating machine learning predictions into RDTSR. Specifically, LADTSR adjusts the purchase thresholds in RDTSR based on the confidence in the predictions.

Main Contributions:

- Designed a robust online algorithm RDTSR for the two-level ski-rental problem and proved its competitive ratio guarantee. RDTSR eliminates issues with prior arts when allowing multi-unit demands.

- Proposed the first learning-augmented algorithm LADTSR for this problem by integrating predictions into robust online algorithm. Rigorously proved that LADTSR achieves both consistency (performs well with accurate predictions) and robustness (retains worst-case guarantees regardless of prediction quality).

- Conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the robustness of RDTSR and validate the consistency-robustness tradeoff achieved by LADTSR. Results corroborate the practical benefits of the learning-augmentation.
