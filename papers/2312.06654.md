## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents LightSim, a novel lighting simulation system for generating realistic, controllable, and diverse camera data of urban driving scenes under varying illumination conditions. The key idea is to first build lighting-aware digital twins of real-world locations from multi-sensor data, including estimated geometry, appearance, and lighting. LightSim then performs neural rendering on these digital twins to enable flexible editing such as actor insertion/modification and viewpoint changes. To realistically adapt the scene lighting, LightSim proposes a neural deferred rendering approach that enhances the realism of physically-based rendering using a learned model. Experiments on self-driving datasets demonstrate LightSim's ability to produce high-fidelity, spatially- and temporally-consistent relighting videos. Compared to prior works, LightSim also achieves significantly improved perceptual quality and boosts downstream perception model performance when used for data augmentation. The capacity to generate photorealistic sensor simulation under diverse lighting makes LightSim an important step towards enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.
