# [Counterfactual Plans under Distributional Ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12487)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper studies the problem of generating counterfactual explanations with multiple possibilities (a counterfactual plan) under uncertainty in the prediction model's parameters. The key research questions it addresses are:

1. How can we quantify the validity or robustness of a counterfactual plan when the model's parameters are uncertain? The paper proposes lower and upper bounds on the probability that a plan will remain valid under random future model parameters.

2. How can we improve the validity of a pre-computed counterfactual plan? The paper provides two types of corrections - a Requirement correction to ensure the expected model parameters satisfy the plan, and an Improvement correction to directly increase the lower validity bound. 

3. How can we construct a counterfactual plan that balances validity, proximity to the original input, and diversity, while taking model uncertainty into account? The paper proposes the COPA optimization framework to generate such plans.

The overarching hypothesis is that explicitly accounting for uncertainty in the model's parameters when generating counterfactual plans will lead to more robust and useful plans compared to prior methods that assume fixed parameters. The bounds, corrections, and COPA framework are proposed to address this hypothesis.

In summary, the paper makes contributions in quantifying, improving, and directly constructing counterfactual plans under model parameter uncertainty, which is important for reliability as models are updated over time. The proposed techniques help provide more robust recourse suggestions to individuals affected by algorithmic decisions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of the paper "Counterfactual Plans under Distributional Ambiguity" is developing methods for generating robust counterfactual explanations that remain valid even when the model's parameters change over time. Here are the key points:

- Proposes a method to compute lower and upper bounds on the probability that a given counterfactual plan will remain valid under uncertain/ambiguous future model parameters. This allows assessing the robustness of a plan.

- Provides two methods (Requirement and Improvement corrections) to adjust an existing counterfactual plan to improve its validity measure and make it more robust to distributional shifts in the model parameters. 

- Develops a framework called COPA (COunterfactual Plan under Ambiguity) to construct a counterfactual plan that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the model parameters. It optimizes a weighted objective involving validity, proximity, and diversity of the plan.

- The validity measure used in COPA is computationally efficient and avoids solving complex semidefinite programs. The overall plan optimization can be solved via gradient descent.

- Provides experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating that the proposed methods can improve robustness of counterfactual plans to distributional shifts compared to prior work.

In summary, the main novelty is developing the ability to construct and evaluate counterfactual plans under uncertain model parameters, making the plans more robust and reliable for real applications where model updates are common. The validity bounds and plan corrections are the main technical contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to generate counterfactual explanations that are robust to distributional shifts in the model's parameters, by modeling the uncertainty using only first and second moment information. The framework provides validity bounds for a counterfactual plan, methods to correct the plan to improve validity, and an optimization approach called COPA that constructs a plan balancing validity, proximity, and diversity under parameter ambiguity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several novel contributions to the field of counterfactual explanations under model uncertainty:

1. It proposes new methods to quantify the validity of counterfactual plans by computing lower and upper bounds on the probability that a plan will remain valid under future model updates. This is an important contribution as most prior work assumes model invariance. 

2. It introduces two new approaches (Requirement and Improvement corrections) to adjust counterfactual plans to improve their validity measures. These provide concrete ways to make plans more robust to model shifts.

3. It develops a new optimization framework called COPA to construct counterfactual plans that explicitly incorporate model uncertainty. COPA balances competing objectives of validity, proximity, and diversity.

Compared to related work, this paper is unique in its focus on model uncertainty and shift. Prior work on counterfactual explanations either ignores model updates entirely [1-3] or only considers it in limited ways like fixed adversarial perturbations [4]. In contrast, this paper models uncertainty using distributional ambiguity sets and proposes tools to quantify, correct, and optimize counterfactual plans accordingly.

The proposed validity bounds are novel diagnostics that do not exist in prior work. The correctness techniques also do not appear elsewhere. The COPA framework integrates model uncertainty directly into the optimization in a principled way, unlike prior heuristic approaches.

Overall, this paper makes important theoretical and algorithmic contributions to counterfactual explanations under model shift. The proposed techniques provide practical ways to make plans more robust and reliable in real-world applications where models evolve over time.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper "Counterfactual Explanations under Model Uncertainty" suggests several potential directions for future research:

1. Extending the analysis and methods to non-linear models. The paper focuses on linear classification settings. Developing techniques for non-linear models like neural networks would be an important next step.

2. Incorporating additional types of model uncertainty beyond distributional uncertainty over the parameters. For example, the model class itself could be uncertain (e.g. linear vs. non-linear models). 

3. Considering other notions of proximity for counterfactuals besides Euclidean distance. Different proximity measures may better capture feasibility or preference in some applications.

4. Developing methods that provide certificates of robustness for counterfactual explanations, i.e. formally proving that an explanation satisfies certain validity guarantees across a precisely defined set of models.

5. Conducting user studies to better understand how different notions of explanation validity are perceived by humans and impact trust and satisfaction. 

6. Developing interactive or incremental approaches to counterfactual explanation that incorporate human feedback.

7. Scaling up counterfactual explanation methods to handle high-dimensional, complex data like images, video and text.

In summary, extending the robustness analysis to more complex ML models, integrating different forms of uncertainty, using more sophisticated proximity measures, providing robustness certificates, and conducting human-centered evaluations are highlighted as promising directions for future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for generating counterfactual explanations that are robust to distributional shift in the model parameters. The key idea is to construct a counterfactual plan, consisting of multiple counterfactual examples, that balances competing objectives of proximity, diversity, and validity under model uncertainty. 

To achieve this, the authors first develop tools to quantify the validity of a counterfactual plan by computing bounds on the probability that the plan remains feasible for future model parameters. Building on these insights, they then propose methods to correct an existing plan to improve its validity. Finally, they formulate an optimization problem called COPA that constructs a robust counterfactual plan by directly incorporating the uncertainty in model parameters. COPA minimizes a weighted combination of proximity, diversity, and validity terms. The authors demonstrate empirically that plans produced by COPA are more robust to distribution shift compared to prior methods.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) validity bounds under model uncertainty, 2) plan correction methods, and 3) the COPA formulation that constructs robust plans by design. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data highlight the advantages of the proposed techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Counterfactual Explanations under Distributional Shift":

The paper studies the problem of generating counterfactual explanations that are robust to distributional shifts in the model parameters. It proposes bounding the probability that a counterfactual plan remains valid under uncertain future model parameters using only first and second moment information about the parameter distribution. The lower and upper bounds on validity probability are obtained by solving semidefinite programs leveraging multivariate Chebyshev inequality. To increase validity, the paper provides two methods to correct an existing counterfactual plan: a Requirement correction to ensure the expected parameter lies in the favorable region, and a Mahalanobis Improvement correction to maximize distance from the expected parameter to invalidity hyperplanes. Based on the validity measure, the paper also proposes a COPA framework to construct a counterfactual plan by optimizing a weighted combination of proximity, diversity, and validity terms using a projected gradient descent algorithm.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating robust counterfactual explanations under distributional shift of the model's parameters. Specifically, it considers the setting where we have a counterfactual plan, which is a set of multiple counterfactual examples, and we want to ensure this plan remains valid even when the model is updated with new data in the future. 

The key questions addressed in the paper are:

1. How can we quantify the validity of a counterfactual plan under uncertain future model parameters? The paper proposes computing lower and upper bounds on the probability that the plan remains valid over a distributional set defined by the first and second moments of the model parameters.

2. How can we correct or adjust an existing counterfactual plan to improve its validity? The paper proposes two types of corrections - a Requirement correction to ensure a nominal mean parameter vector lies inside the favorable set, and an Improvement correction to maximize a robust validity metric. 

3. How can we construct a counterfactual plan that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty during optimization? The paper proposes the COPA framework that minimizes a weighted objective with terms for validity, proximity, and diversity of the plan.

Overall, the key novelty is in studying counterfactual plans instead of individual explanations, and developing tools to assess and improve plan validity under distributional shift of the model parameters. This allows generating robust counterfactual explanations that remain useful even when the model changes over time.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper studies the problem of generating counterfactual explanations that are robust to distributional shifts in the model parameters. Counterfactual explanations suggest how an input instance should be modified to receive a different model prediction. However, they are often generated assuming the model is static, even though model parameters may change over time as new data arrives. To address this, the authors propose a framework called COPA that generates counterfactual plans accounting for uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, they assume the distribution of the parameters is only partially specified by its first and second moments. First, they develop a tool to compute bounds on the probability a counterfactual plan remains valid under the uncertain parameters. Next, they propose methods to correct counterfactual plans to improve their validity measure. Finally, they formulate an optimization problem for COPA to construct a counterfactual plan balancing validity, proximity of the suggestions to the original input, and diversity of suggestions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate COPA can produce more robust counterfactual plans compared to prior methods. The framework provides useful tools for evaluating, correcting, and generating counterfactual explanations that are more likely to remain valid as model parameters shift.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes that the distribution of the model parameters is Gaussian. How would the bounds and corrections change if a different distributional assumption was made, such as Laplace or Student's t-distribution?

2. The paper considers linear classification models. How could the method be extended to nonlinear classifiers, such as kernel SVMs or neural networks? Would constructing local linear approximations be a viable approach?

3. The paper proposes two types of corrections - Requirement and Improvement. Are there other types of corrections that could be designed to increase the validity of counterfactual plans?

4. How sensitive is the method to the choice of the Gelbrich radius ρ? Does the performance degrade gracefully as ρ increases?

5. Could the diversity term in the COPA optimization problem be designed in a different way, rather than using a determinantal point process? How would this impact the resulting counterfactual plans?

6. The paper evaluates the method on a few real-world datasets. How would it perform on high-dimensional datasets where d is very large? Would scalability become an issue?

7. The validity bounds rely on solving semidefinite programs. For very large d, could the bounds be approximated or lower bounds derived using other techniques like randomized methods?

8. The paper assumes the first two moments of the parameter distribution are known. If there was uncertainty in the mean and covariance, how could that be accounted for in the ambiguity set?

9. The Mahalanobis correction uses the nominal mean and covariance for weighting. Could other choices of weighting matrices further improve the corrections?
