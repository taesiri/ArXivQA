# [Ranking Distillation for Open-Ended Video Question Answering with   Insufficient Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), which requires finding correct answers from a large set to video-related questions. This is a multi-label classification problem since questions can have multiple correct answers. However, existing benchmarks only provide extremely insufficient labels, typically just one answer per question, leading to limited generalization ability of models which treat all unlabeled answers as incorrect. This is termed the "insufficient labeling problem".

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate the insufficient labeling problem without needing additional manual annotations. RADI uses a teacher model trained on incomplete labels to generate rankings over potential answers. These rankings provide rich inter-label information and association between visual cues and labels to enrich the limited labeling. To avoid overfitting to the imperfect teacher, two robust distillation methods are presented:

1) Adaptive pairwise ranking distillation: Introduces uncertainty-based soft margins to adaptively relax optimization constraints on uncertain pairwise rankings.

2) Partial listwise ranking distillation: Uses a ranking-based sampling strategy for distillation on a subset of answers to reduce bias.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals and formally defines the insufficient labeling problem in OE-VQA
- Presents an effective ranking distillation framework RADI to address the problem without extra annotation
- Designs two robust distillation strategies to enhance tolerance to imperfect teachers
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of RADI over existing methods on five popular VQA datasets
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RADI on insufficient labeling problem

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in revealing and providing an effective solution to the important but previously overlooked insufficient labeling problem in the open-ended VQA task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a ranking distillation framework called RADI to address the insufficient labeling problem in open-ended video question answering by utilizing the rankings from an imperfect teacher model to provide additional label information for training the student model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Revealing the insufficient labeling problem in open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA) and presenting an effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to overcome it without requiring extra manual annotation. 

2. Designing two robust distillation strategies (pairwise ranking distillation and listwise ranking distillation) to enhance the robustness of RADI to noisy rankings from the imperfect teacher model.

3. Conducting extensive experiments on five popular OE-VQA benchmarks to demonstrate the improvement of RADI over state-of-the-art models and the effectiveness of the two distillation strategies.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the RADI framework and associated robust distillation strategies to address the insufficient labeling problem in OE-VQA without needing additional manual labeling effort.

- Sampling strategies

The paper focuses on the insufficient labeling problem in OE-VQA, where existing benchmarks only provide very limited ground truth labels (typically one answer per question). To overcome this without additional manual annotation, the authors propose a ranking distillation framework (RADI) that utilizes the rankings and distributions from an imperfect teacher model to enrich the labeling information. Further robust strategies are introduced through pairwise and listwise ranking distillation approaches.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a ranking distillation framework (RADI) to address the insufficient labeling problem in open-ended video QA. How does RADI enrich the limited label information compared to other baseline methods like label smoothing and pseudo labeling?

2. The paper presents two robust distillation strategies - pairwise ranking distillation and listwise ranking distillation. What are the key ideas behind these two strategies to enhance robustness against noisy rankings from the imperfect teacher model?

3. Adaptive pairwise ranking distillation is proposed with two steps - uncertainty estimation and margin adaptation. What is the intuition behind using Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation? How does optimal transport help in margin adaptation?

4. Two ranking-based sampling strategies are proposed for partial listwise ranking distillation - exponential sampling and Zipf sampling. What are the motivations and effects of sampling broadly from the entire ranked list?

5. How does the paper experimentally show that both pairwise and listwise ranking distillation strategies outperform state-of-the-art methods on insufficient labeling? What are the key results?

6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of pairwise versus listwise ranking distillation strategies? When is one preferred over the other? 

7. The paper shows RADI brings consistent improvements across different listwise loss functions. Analyze the effects of using different listwise losses.

8. The paper analyzes impacts of the classification loss, ranking loss and distillation coefficient α. What are the tradeoffs involved? How to determine an optimal α?

9. Analyze the time complexity of RADI. How does it achieve efficiency without extra burden during inference?

10. The paper shows RADI demonstrates stronger robustness over knowledge distillation to imperfect teacher models. Discuss the reasons behind the improved robustness.
