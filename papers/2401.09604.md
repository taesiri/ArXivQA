# [MedBlindTuner: Towards Privacy-preserving Fine-tuning on Biomedical   Images with Transformers and Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09604)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hospitals want to utilize external machine learning services to analyze medical images, but sharing sensitive patient data poses privacy risks. Regulations like HIPAA require patient consent and confidentiality protections when handling healthcare records. So there is a need for privacy-preserving machine learning techniques allowing model training on encrypted data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MedBlindTuner, a framework enabling privacy-preserving fine-tuning of transformer models on homomorphically encrypted medical images. It involves two parties - the hospital encrypts and sends image features to a cloud service provider, which trains a model on the encrypted data without seeing the raw contents.  

Key Methods:
- Uses fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) with the CKKS scheme to allow computations on encrypted data
- Employs data-efficient image transformers (DEiT) for efficient vision model training
- Hospital extracts features from images using DEiT and encrypts them before sending to cloud 
- Cloud fine-tunes model on encrypted features using encrypted matrix multiplication and Nesterov accelerated gradient

Main Contributions:
- First framework to combine FHE and DEiT for privacy-preserving medical image analysis
- Achieves comparable accuracy to non-encrypted models with minimal loss in model utility
- Enables outsourced ML on sensitive patient data while preserving privacy 
- Easy integration without needing cryptography expertise
- Evaluated on multi-class classification across 5 benchmark medical image datasets - encrypted models achieve within 1-2% accuracy of non-encrypted versions

The solution enables harnessing machine learning for healthcare applications without compromising patient data confidentiality, overcoming privacy risks in transmitting or sharing sensitive medical records.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) during encrypted fine-tuning on the cloud side. Can you explain why NAG was chosen over other optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam? What are the benefits of using NAG in this context?

2. One of the main contributions mentioned is using data-efficient image transformers (DEiT) on the hospital side for feature extraction. What modifications were made to the original ViT architecture in DEiT to improve data efficiency? How does this benefit the overall framework?

3. The CKKS fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is utilized in this framework. What are some of the main advantages of CKKS over other FHE schemes like BGV or BFV when handling real numbers for machine learning applications?

4. How does the framework handle activation functions like softmax during encrypted computation on the cloud side? What approximation techniques are used? And why is an approximation needed in the first place?

5. What threat model is assumed in the paper? What are the trust assumptions between the hospital and cloud service provider? Could you describe some potential attack scenarios?

6. One experiment shows a 0.15% drop in accuracy on BloodMNIST between encrypted and non-encrypted models. What factors contribute to this slight performance gap? And how can it be further reduced?

7. How exactly does the framework extract features from medical images using DEiT on the hospital side? What hyperparameters and configurations are used for this?

8. The framework demonstrates encrypted training times over 30x longer than unencrypted. What optimizations could reduce this computational overhead of homomorphic encryption?

9. How does the accuracy of models trained using this privacy-preserving method compare to state-of-the-art approaches trained on plain non-encrypted data?

10. Can you walk through the complete end-to-end workflow step-by-step from the hospital encrypting data to the cloud performing private inference?
