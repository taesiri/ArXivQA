# [SSL-OTA: Unveiling Backdoor Threats in Self-Supervised Learning for   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00137)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is becoming widely used in computer vision models. However, the reliance on large unlabeled datasets and third-party pre-trained encoders introduces potential security threats from backdoor attacks. Prior work has mainly explored such attacks in image classification models, with limited research into implications for object detection. Attacking object detectors is more challenging but can pose serious threats to critical applications like autonomous driving. Therefore, it is important to investigate effective backdoor attacks tailored for object detection in SSL settings.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the first backdoor attack on object detection models in SSL contexts, called Object Transform Attack (SSL-OTA). It uses a trigger pattern that alters predictions of a target object to a desired category. Two attack variants are introduced:

1) Naive Attack (NA): Conducts data poisoning of the downstream detector's training set to implant backdoors.

2) Dual-Source Blending Attack (DSBA): Additional backdoor injection into the pre-trained encoder using a shadow dataset, besides poisoning the downstream detector.

The attacks are stealthy, achieving high attack success rate even at 0.5% poisoning rate, with minimal impact on model utility.

Main Contributions:
- First demonstration of backdoor threats to object detection in SSL, a critical but less explored task.
- Introduction of two simple yet effective attacks, NA and enhanced DSBA. 
- Extensive experiments validating attack performance on benchmark datasets using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Analysis of various factors influencing attack efficacy through ablation studies.
- Showcasing risks of backdoor attacks in SSL-based object detectors and providing perspective to enhance security.
