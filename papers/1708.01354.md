# [CASSL: Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can curriculum learning be applied to improve self-supervised robotic manipulation tasks involving high-level, high-dimensional control?

Specifically, the authors propose a method called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) to address the limitations of random exploration and staged training approaches when learning policies that map visual inputs to complex, multidimensional control outputs. 

The key ideas are:

- Define a curriculum over the control space instead of the data space. Prioritize learning of certain control dimensions before others.

- Use global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset to determine which control dimensions interact the least and can be learned independently. These form the early stages of the curriculum.

- Learn control policies with deep neural networks using a multi-task classification approach on discretized control outputs.

- Progressively shift exploration from learned to new control dimensions through curriculum training.

The central hypothesis is that CASSL will enable more efficient and effective learning of high-dimensional control policies compared to standard approaches like random sampling and staged training. This is evaluated on an adaptive grasping task using a robot manipulator.

In summary, the paper focuses on developing and evaluating a principled curriculum learning strategy over control dimensions to improve self-supervised learning of complex robotic manipulation skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel self-supervised learning approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) for high-level, high-dimensional robotic control. 

2. Using variance-based global sensitivity analysis on a dataset of physical robotic interactions to determine a curriculum (priority ordering) for learning different control parameters. The key idea is to learn the most independent and least interacting control dimensions first.

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of CASSL on the real-world task of grasping with an adaptive 3-fingered gripper, which involves a 6-dimensional control space. 

4. Showing through physical experiments that CASSL outperforms baseline methods like random exploration, staged curriculum learning, and end-to-end learning on both seen and novel test objects. Specifically, CASSL achieved 70% grasp success on seen objects and 62% on novel objects, outperforming baselines by 8-14%.

5. Presenting one of the first applications of curriculum learning on a physical robotic task and showing that it can learn robust policies with very few examples.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing CASSL, a sensitivity analysis based curriculum learning approach, for sample-efficient self-supervised learning of high-dimensional robotic control policies. The effectiveness is shown through real-world adaptive grasping experiments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the information provided, here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The key contribution seems to be proposing curriculum learning in the control/action space for robot learning tasks. This is a novel idea compared to standard curriculum learning that focuses on ordering the training data. 

- Most prior self-supervised robotic learning papers operate on low-dimensional output spaces and use random exploration for data collection. This paper tackles high-dimensional control and argues that smarter sampling is needed.

- The use of sensitivity analysis to determine the curriculum ranking is also novel. Prior curriculum learning work has used hand-designed rankings, uncertainty sampling, or dynamic updating of curriculum.

- For robot learning, this paper builds on prior self-supervised methods like Levine et al. and Pinto et al. but argues they are limited by random data sampling. It also relates to hierarchical RL, but uses the high-level policy trained with CASSL in a self-supervised manner rather than full RL.

- For grasping specifically, data-driven methods like Levine et al., Pinto et al., Mahler et al. typically operate on simpler 3D grasp spaces. This paper shows CASSL can work on a more complex 6D grasping configuration space.

- The evaluations are quite extensive with comparisons to random sampling, staged learning, random curriculum baselines. Testing on novel objects shows generalization ability.

Overall, the core novelty seems to be curriculum learning over the action/control space rather than the data samples, using sensitivity analysis to determine the ranking. This idea and the CASSL framework appear novel compared to prior self-supervised learning and curriculum learning approaches in robotics. The experiments on high-dimensional grasping also showcase benefits compared to prior grasping methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Modify the existing CASSL framework to include a dynamically changing curriculum instead of using a pre-computed stationary ordering. The authors suggest exploring ways to dynamically update the curriculum based on the model's ongoing performance.

- Investigate applications of CASSL in hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the high-level policy trained with CASSL could be used alongside a lower-level controller. The high-level policy focuses on what to do while the low-level controller focuses on how to do it.

- Scale up CASSL for learning higher dimensional manipulation tasks like in-hand manipulation. The authors suggest applying and testing CASSL on more complex manipulation tasks that involve controlling even more parameters.

- Explore curriculum learning for low-level control primitives like actuator torques. The current work focuses on high-level control but the authors suggest expanding it to learn low-level motor controls as well.

- Reduce the dependence on large-scale datasets. While CASSL helps reduce data needs, the authors suggest exploring ways to further minimize the data requirements.

In summary, the main future directions are: dynamically updating the curriculum, applications in hierarchical RL, scaling up to higher-dimensional tasks, expanding to low-level control, and reducing data dependence. The key is to expand and improve the CASSL framework's capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper introduces Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL), a method for efficient high-dimensional control learning in robotics. CASSL uses curriculum learning to determine an optimal ordering for learning different control parameters, with the goal of starting with the easiest dimensions and gradually increasing complexity. To determine the curriculum, CASSL performs sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset to quantify the independence and interactions between control dimensions. The control policy is modeled as a CNN that predicts discretized actions for each control parameter from input images. Training proceeds in stages following the curriculum order, with high exploration on the current control dimension and low exploration on previously learned dimensions. CASSL is applied to 6-DOF grasping with an adaptive robot gripper, significantly outperforming baselines like random sampling and staged training on test sets of novel objects. The work demonstrates that curriculum learning over control space is an effective strategy for sample-efficient learning of high-dimensional policies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) for training policies that map visual inputs to high-level, high-dimensional control actions. CASSL utilizes curriculum learning over the control parameter space, rather than the commonly used curriculum over training examples. It first ranks the control parameters based on a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters most influence the success metric and have low correlation. The curriculum then trains the model by focusing sampling and learning on a subset of control parameters at a time, starting with the highest ranked ones. This allows efficient learning of the control policy with limited training data.  

CASSL is applied to the task of grasping with an adaptive 3-fingered gripper, which has a 8-D control space. Using sensitivity analysis, a curriculum of height, angle, force, and mode parameters is derived. The policy model uses a CNN to map image patches to discretized control actions. Experimental results on a physical robot demonstrate that CASSL achieves 70% grasp success on seen objects and 62% on novel objects. This significantly outperforms baselines like staged training and end-to-end learning with random exploration, especially on novel objects. The key benefits are needing fewer examples and ability to scale to higher D control.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) for training policies that map visual information to high-level, high-dimensional action spaces for robotic control. CASSL orders the sampling of training data based on control dimensions - focusing learning on a few control parameters first before expanding to other parameters. The curriculum ranking is determined by performing variance-based global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset of physical robotic interactions. This analysis quantifies how uncertainty in the output (e.g. grasp success) can be attributed to uncertainty in each control input. The control dimensions are then learned sequentially in descending order of their sensitivity indices while also minimizing their correlation with other dimensions. This curriculum optimized ordering allows CASSL to learn robust grasping policies with very few training examples compared to random sampling or staged training baselines. The effectiveness of CASSL is demonstrated on learning adaptive multi-fingered grasping on a physical robot.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to efficiently learn policies that map visual information to high-dimensional control actions for robotic manipulation tasks. 

Specifically, they point out that most prior self-supervised learning approaches for robotics rely on random exploration of the action space and work well only for low-dimensional outputs (3-6 dimensions). However, scaling these methods to higher dimensional control becomes challenging as it requires vastly more data collection. 

To address this, the authors propose a new approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) that focuses the data collection on learning certain control parameters first before others. The key ideas are:

1) Define a curriculum over the control parameters based on sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters are easier/harder to learn and less/more correlated. 

2) Learn the "easier" control parameters first while keeping the harder ones fixed/greedy. This reduces the effective search space earlier on.

3) As learning progresses, open up more control parameters gradually.

The authors demonstrate CASSL on the task of 6-DOF grasping with an adaptive robot gripper. Their results show CASSL can learn effective grasping policies with significantly less data than standard approaches like random exploration or staged training.

So in summary, the key problem is developing an efficient exploration strategy and curriculum for learning high-dimensional control policies from visual inputs in a self-supervised manner. CASSL is proposed to address this issue.

- Curriculum learning - The idea of learning concepts in an ordered progression from easy to hard, similar to how humans learn. Used here to determine an optimal order for learning robot control parameters.

- Self-supervised learning - Learning from raw sensor inputs like images without explicit labeling. The robot learns based on its own interactions with the environment and outcome (success/failure). 

- Sensitivity analysis - A method to quantify how uncertainty in the output of a model or system can be attributed to different input variables. Used here to analyze importance of different control parameters.

- Adaptive grasping - Using a gripper that can automatically adapt its fingers to grasp a variety of objects, instead of precise control of individual fingers.

- High-dimensional control - Controlling a system with many parameters, like the 8-dimensional space for grasping used here.

- Curriculum over control space - Ordering the learning of different control parameters instead of ordering the training examples. A novel application of curriculum learning.

- Grasping configurations - Parameters like height, angle, force that determine how the gripper approaches and grasps the object.

So in summary, the key focus is using curriculum learning and self-supervised deep learning to efficiently learn high-dimensional robotic control for adaptive grasping.
