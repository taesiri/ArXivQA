# [CASSL: Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can curriculum learning be applied to improve self-supervised robotic manipulation tasks involving high-level, high-dimensional control?Specifically, the authors propose a method called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) to address the limitations of random exploration and staged training approaches when learning policies that map visual inputs to complex, multidimensional control outputs. The key ideas are:- Define a curriculum over the control space instead of the data space. Prioritize learning of certain control dimensions before others.- Use global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset to determine which control dimensions interact the least and can be learned independently. These form the early stages of the curriculum.- Learn control policies with deep neural networks using a multi-task classification approach on discretized control outputs.- Progressively shift exploration from learned to new control dimensions through curriculum training.The central hypothesis is that CASSL will enable more efficient and effective learning of high-dimensional control policies compared to standard approaches like random sampling and staged training. This is evaluated on an adaptive grasping task using a robot manipulator.In summary, the paper focuses on developing and evaluating a principled curriculum learning strategy over control dimensions to improve self-supervised learning of complex robotic manipulation skills.
