# [CASSL: Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can curriculum learning over control dimensions be used to efficiently learn policies that map visual inputs to high-dimensional robotic control outputs? 

In particular, the paper focuses on the problem of sampling and self-supervised learning for high-level, high-dimensional robotic control. The key ideas explored are:

- Defining a curriculum over control dimensions to incrementally focus learning on subsets of the control space rather than randomly exploring the full space all at once.

- Using global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset to determine which control dimensions should be focused on first in the curriculum ranking. The goal is to identify dimensions that are most independent and easiest to learn. 

- Modeling the control policy with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes in image inputs and outputs distributions over discretized control actions.

- Training the model in stages following the curriculum ranking, aggregating data over time in a self-supervised fashion.

The central hypothesis seems to be that curriculum learning over control dimensions can enable more efficient self-supervised learning of high-dimensional robotic policies compared to standard approaches like random exploration or staged training. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on real-world robotic grasping with an adaptive multi-fingered gripper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the provided text, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:

1. Introducing a novel approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) for learning high-level, high-dimensional control policies from visual inputs. 

2. Using global sensitivity analysis on a dataset of robot interactions to determine a curriculum (priority ordering) over the control parameters. The key idea is to learn independent and weakly interacting control parameters first.

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of CASSL on the task of grasping with an adaptive 3-fingered gripper. The experiments show that:

- CASSL achieves higher grasping accuracy compared to baselines like random sampling, staged training, and end-to-end learning.

- It generalizes better to novel test objects not seen during training.

- Defining an optimal curriculum using sensitivity analysis is important, compared to curriculum based on random ranking.

4. Providing the first demonstration of curriculum learning on a real-world physical robot task, to the best of the authors' knowledge.

5. Proposing a framework that could potentially be applied to other robot learning problems beyond just grasping.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing the CASSL approach, using sensitivity analysis to define curriculum over control parameters, and experimentally validating its benefits for learning adaptive grasping on a real robot.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key ways it compares to other research in robotic grasping:

- It focuses on high-dimensional control for grasping, whereas much prior self-supervised robotic learning work has focused on lower dimensional spaces (e.g. 3-6 dimensions). This allows the method to learn more complex policies, but requires more sophisticated sampling and curriculum strategies.

- It uses curriculum learning over the control dimensions to determine which parameters to focus on learning first. This is a novel curriculum approach compared to prior work that uses curriculum over training examples or tasks. Defining the curriculum with sensitivity analysis is also novel.

- For sampling the training data, it proposes an Importance Sampling approach to choose actions the model is most uncertain about. This aims to drive exploration and data collection more efficiently than random sampling.

- It demonstrates the ideas on a real physical robot with an adaptive gripper, achieving significant gains over baselines like random sampling and staged training. Much prior work has focused on simulation or simpler grippers.

- It aims to learn from raw visual inputs, using a CNN policy model. Many classical grasping methods require explicit 3D object models.

Overall, the key novelties are using control-based curriculum learning driven by sensitivity analysis, and importance sampling for efficient data collection. This enables training deep neural network policies that map images to high-dimensional adaptive gripper actions for real-world grasping. The results demonstrate improved data efficiency and performance compared to baseline exploration strategies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Modifying the CASSL framework to include a dynamically changing curriculum instead of using a pre-computed stationary ordering. The authors suggest exploring how adaptively updating the curriculum could improve performance.

- Applying CASSL in hierarchical reinforcement learning settings, where the high-level policy trained with CASSL could be used with a low-level controller. This could help scale up reinforcement learning methods.

- Scaling up CASSL for learning high-dimensional manipulation skills like in-hand manipulation. The authors suggest CASSL could help reduce the data needs for learning complex manipulation skills with many degrees of freedom. 

- Exploring other applications of CASSL beyond grasping, such as using it for other robot learning and self-supervised learning tasks. The general CASSL framework is not task-specific.

- Reducing the dependence on large-scale datasets in self-supervised robot learning methods. The authors suggest CASSL could help reduce data needs for self-supervised techniques.

- Validating CASSL on a wider range of robotic platforms and tasks. The current work focuses on grasping with an adaptive gripper, but CASSL could be tested more broadly.

So in summary, the main directions are: dynamically updating the curriculum, applying CASSL to reinforcement learning and complex manipulation skills, reducing data dependence in self-supervised learning, and evaluating CASSL more extensively on diverse robot systems and tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL), a novel approach for training policies that map visual information to high-level, high-dimensional action spaces in robotic manipulation tasks. The key idea is to order the sampling of training data based on the control dimensions, focusing learning on a few control parameters before others according to a curriculum. The curriculum ranking is determined using variance-based global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset of physical robotic interactions, selecting dimensions that are most independent and have the least interactions with other dimensions. CASSL is applied to the task of grasping with an adaptive 3-fingered gripper, a challenging 8-dimensional control problem. Experimental results demonstrate that defining a curriculum over the control space leads to significantly improved grasping rates compared to baseline methods like random sampling and staged-training on novel test objects. The work illustrates the potential of curriculum learning in control space for data-efficient self-supervised robotic learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL), a new approach for efficiently learning high-dimensional control policies from images. CASSL uses curriculum learning to determine an optimal ordering for learning different control parameters. It first collects an initial dataset by sampling control parameters using a quasi-random sequence. This data is used to perform sensitivity analysis, which quantifies how uncertainty in the output (success/failure) depends on uncertainty in the inputs (control parameters). The sensitivity analysis ranks control parameters based on which ones most independently influence the output. The curriculum then trains models by focusing learning on the most sensitive parameters first before gradually adding other parameters. 

CASSL is applied to learning adaptive grasping using a robot with a 3-fingered gripper, which requires controlling 6 pose and configuration parameters. Through physical robot experiments, CASSL achieved 70% and 62% grasp success rates on seen and novel objects, outperforming baselines like random exploration (48% on novel objects) and staged training (54%). The key ideas are using sensitivity analysis to optimize the curriculum order over control parameters and incrementally adding parameters into the learning. This improves sample efficiency and performance on high-dimensional control tasks compared to standard self-supervised methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) for training policies that map visual information to high-level, high-dimensional control commands for robotic tasks like grasping. CASSL orders the sampling of training data based on the control dimensions - it focuses learning and sampling on few control parameters first before moving to other parameters. The curriculum or priority ordering of the control dimensions is determined by performing variance-based global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset of physical robotic interactions. This analysis identifies the sensitivity of the task outcome to each control parameter as well as their interactions. Using this sensitivity information, CASSL selects control dimensions that have high sensitivity but low correlation with other dimensions to learn first. This curriculum ranking ensures easier aspects of the control policy are learned first. CASSL is demonstrated on learning adaptive grasping with an underactuated 3-fingered gripper, which involves learning a 6-D control policy from visual inputs. Experiments indicate CASSL provides improved performance over baselines like staged/random curriculum learning and end-to-end learning with random exploration.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are addressing is how to efficiently sample and learn high-dimensional control policies from visual inputs in a self-supervised manner. Specifically:

- Most prior self-supervised robotic learning methods rely on random exploration to sample training data points. However, random sampling is inefficient for learning in high-dimensional action/control spaces. 

- Existing methods like staged training and on-policy search are also sub-optimal as they initially learn from sparse random samples and have bias.

- The key research question is how should robots sample training points and learn control policies for high-dimensional manipulation skills in an efficient self-supervised manner.

To address this, the main contribution of this paper is a framework called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) that focuses on learning parts of the control space in stages. The key ideas are:

- Use sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset to determine a curriculum ranking over control parameters. Learn independent, least-correlated dimensions first.

- Sample training points by focusing exploration on dimensions being learned in the curriculum stage while exploiting model predictions for others.

- Show that defining a curriculum over the control space leads to much better sample efficiency and performance compared to standard baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a curriculum learning approach in the control space to efficiently learn high-dimensional policies for robotic manipulation in a self-supervised manner from visual inputs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?
