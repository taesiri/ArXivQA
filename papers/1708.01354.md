# [CASSL: Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can curriculum learning be applied to improve self-supervised robotic manipulation tasks involving high-level, high-dimensional control?Specifically, the authors propose a method called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) to address the limitations of random exploration and staged training approaches when learning policies that map visual inputs to complex, multidimensional control outputs. The key ideas are:- Define a curriculum over the control space instead of the data space. Prioritize learning of certain control dimensions before others.- Use global sensitivity analysis on an initial dataset to determine which control dimensions interact the least and can be learned independently. These form the early stages of the curriculum.- Learn control policies with deep neural networks using a multi-task classification approach on discretized control outputs.- Progressively shift exploration from learned to new control dimensions through curriculum training.The central hypothesis is that CASSL will enable more efficient and effective learning of high-dimensional control policies compared to standard approaches like random sampling and staged training. This is evaluated on an adaptive grasping task using a robot manipulator.In summary, the paper focuses on developing and evaluating a principled curriculum learning strategy over control dimensions to improve self-supervised learning of complex robotic manipulation skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel self-supervised learning approach called Curriculum Accelerated Self-Supervised Learning (CASSL) for high-level, high-dimensional robotic control. 2. Using variance-based global sensitivity analysis on a dataset of physical robotic interactions to determine a curriculum (priority ordering) for learning different control parameters. The key idea is to learn the most independent and least interacting control dimensions first.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of CASSL on the real-world task of grasping with an adaptive 3-fingered gripper, which involves a 6-dimensional control space. 4. Showing through physical experiments that CASSL outperforms baseline methods like random exploration, staged curriculum learning, and end-to-end learning on both seen and novel test objects. Specifically, CASSL achieved 70% grasp success on seen objects and 62% on novel objects, outperforming baselines by 8-14%.5. Presenting one of the first applications of curriculum learning on a physical robotic task and showing that it can learn robust policies with very few examples.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing CASSL, a sensitivity analysis based curriculum learning approach, for sample-efficient self-supervised learning of high-dimensional robotic control policies. The effectiveness is shown through real-world adaptive grasping experiments.
