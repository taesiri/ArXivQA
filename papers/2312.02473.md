# [NeutronStream: A Dynamic GNN Training Framework with Sliding Window for   Graph Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02473)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents NeutronStream, a framework for training dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) on evolving graph streams. Existing GNN frameworks assume static input graphs and lack support for dynamic updates, posing challenges for dynamic GNN training. NeutronStream proposes a sliding window method to incrementally select events from graph streams for model training, enabling the capture of spatial-temporal event dependencies. It also puts forward a fine-grained event parallel execution scheme by analyzing dependencies among events and identifying non-conflicting events for parallel processing. Additionally, NeutronStream provides a built-in dynamic graph storage and easy-to-use APIs to facilitate the implementation of dynamic GNN models. Experiments on three popular dynamic GNNs demonstrate that NeutronStream's sliding window training brings average accuracy improvements of 3.97\%, and achieves 1.48-5.87x speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. The proposed techniques in NeutronStream advance the state-of-the-art in dynamic GNN training systems, enabling more efficient and accurate learning on temporal graphs.
