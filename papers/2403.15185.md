# [Investigating the Performance of Language Models for Completing Code in   Functional Programming Languages: a Haskell Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code completion models typically focus on imperative languages like Python and JavaScript, with little research on functional languages like Haskell. This results in poor performance when applying these models to Haskell.
- It is unclear whether Haskell is more difficult for code completion models compared to imperative languages. 
- The common pitfalls for code completion when applied to Haskell are also unknown.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate two code completion models (CodeGPT and UniXcoder) on Haskell code after fine-tuning them on a Haskell dataset called Blastwind.
- Compare performance to baseline metrics on Python and Java to determine quantitative differences.
- Manually analyze a newly created dataset called HumanEval-Haskell to identify common mistakes the models make on Haskell.

Key Contributions:
- Showed that fine-tuning significantly improves performance on Haskell over base models, indicating that knowledge of imperative languages does not transfer well. This highlights the need for Haskell datasets.
- Haskell appears more difficult than Python/Java but more research is needed with larger datasets to confirm this. 
- CodeGPT tends to generate more empty predictions while UniXcoder produces more incorrect/incomplete ones. No specific pitfalls found for Haskell.
- Released HumanEval-Haskell dataset and fine-tuned models to enable further research.

In summary, the paper evaluates how well current code completion models can perform on the functional language Haskell, in order to motivate the need for better Haskell support. The authors find that while models can be fine-tuned to comprehend Haskell, overall performance is lacking, indicating a pressing need for more high-quality Haskell datasets and models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the performance of CodeGPT and UniXcoder code completion models on the functional programming language Haskell after fine-tuning them on a Haskell dataset, finding that while knowledge of imperative languages does not transfer well to functional languages, fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with no specific pitfalls detected for Haskell other than an overall need for better language support.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An extensive evaluation of the performance of pre-trained and fine-tuned code completion models on Haskell.

2. A comprehensive assessment of the primary pitfalls of applying code completion to Haskell. 

3. Publicly available manual translation of HumanEval to Haskell for future evaluation, including marked locations of interest for code completion.

4. Publicly available source code and fine-tuned code completion models for Haskell.

In summary, the paper evaluates code completion models on Haskell code, identifies common issues these models have with Haskell, provides translated test data and code to enable further research, and releases fine-tuned models for Haskell.

The paper investigates the performance of language models CodeGPT and UniXcoder on the task of automatic code completion, specifically line completion, for the functional programming language Haskell. It evaluates the models by fine-tuning them on a dataset of Haskell code and measuring performance using metrics like exact match and edit similarity. Other key aspects include manually creating a dataset by translating Python code to Haskell, and identifying common pitfalls the models face when completing Haskell code.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes two datasets for evaluation - Blastwind and a manually translated version of HumanEval. Why was HumanEval chosen for manual evaluation and what was the rationale behind manually translating it to Haskell? How does this choice of dataset impact the conclusions that can be drawn?

2. The paper applies several filtering rules when preprocessing the Blastwind dataset, eliminating over 83% of the original samples. What is the justification behind each of these filtering rules? Could more lenient filtering criteria have been used without compromising the integrity of the results?  

3. When creating the input-output pairs from the Blastwind test set, the paper uses a pseudo-random splitting approach based on whitespace tokens. What are the potential limitations of this approach compared to splitting at logical breakpoints or using entire function bodies? How might this impact performance results?

4. For the manual evaluation, splits are intentionally introduced at points of interest in the code. How were these points selected and what was the rationale behind this? Does manually choosing split points in this way accurately reflect how developers invoke code completion in practice?

5. The fine-tuning times differ significantly between UniXcoder and CodeGPT, with UniXcoder taking much longer. What explains this discrepancy in training times between the models? Could changes to the training process reduce this gap?

6. The paper hypothesizes that the superior performance of base models on HumanEval-Haskell may be because it contains more informative natural language comments. What experiments could be run to test this hypothesis directly? 

7. One of the key conclusions is that multilingual models perform worse on Haskell until fine-tuned. But what proportion of the performance gains come from specializing on the Haskell language itself versus the programming domain? 

8. The paper relies primarily on exact match and edit distance to evaluate model performance. What are some other evaluation metrics that could give additional insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the models on this task?

9. How sensitive are the overall results to hyperparameters used during fine-tuning, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs? Was any hyperparameter search performed to optimize results?

10. The models are applied using beam search during inference. How does the choice of beam size impact the tradeoff between output quality and inference time? Was any analysis done on the relationship between beam size and performance?
