# [Investigating the Performance of Language Models for Completing Code in   Functional Programming Languages: a Haskell Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code completion models typically focus on imperative languages like Python and JavaScript, with little research on functional languages like Haskell. This results in poor performance when applying these models to Haskell.
- It is unclear whether Haskell is more difficult for code completion models compared to imperative languages. 
- The common pitfalls for code completion when applied to Haskell are also unknown.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate two code completion models (CodeGPT and UniXcoder) on Haskell code after fine-tuning them on a Haskell dataset called Blastwind.
- Compare performance to baseline metrics on Python and Java to determine quantitative differences.
- Manually analyze a newly created dataset called HumanEval-Haskell to identify common mistakes the models make on Haskell.

Key Contributions:
- Showed that fine-tuning significantly improves performance on Haskell over base models, indicating that knowledge of imperative languages does not transfer well. This highlights the need for Haskell datasets.
- Haskell appears more difficult than Python/Java but more research is needed with larger datasets to confirm this. 
- CodeGPT tends to generate more empty predictions while UniXcoder produces more incorrect/incomplete ones. No specific pitfalls found for Haskell.
- Released HumanEval-Haskell dataset and fine-tuned models to enable further research.

In summary, the paper evaluates how well current code completion models can perform on the functional language Haskell, in order to motivate the need for better Haskell support. The authors find that while models can be fine-tuned to comprehend Haskell, overall performance is lacking, indicating a pressing need for more high-quality Haskell datasets and models.
