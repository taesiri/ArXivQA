# [VIOLET : End-to-End Video-Language Transformers with Masked Visual-token   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we design an end-to-end video-language transformer model that effectively captures both the temporal dynamics in video and the alignment between visual and textual elements for strong performance on video-language tasks?The key points are:- The paper presents an end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET) for video-language (VidL) modeling. - Previous works have taken a "imagify" approach by treating video frames as static images. This loses important temporal information in videos. - VIOLET uses a Video Swin Transformer to explicitly model temporal dynamics in sparsely sampled video frames.- VIOLET also proposes a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM) to learn better video representations.- Comprehensive experiments show VIOLET achieves state-of-the-art results on video QA and text-to-video retrieval tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling video temporal dynamics and learning better video representations will improve performance on downstream VidL tasks. VIOLET is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents VIOLET, an end-to-end video-language transformer model for video understanding. The main contributions are:1. Proposes an end-to-end architecture called VIOLET that contains a Video Swin Transformer to explicitly model the temporal dynamics in videos, unlike prior works that simply pool frame features.2. Introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM) that recovers masked video patches into a discrete visual token space. This is shown to be more effective than prior masked visual modeling tasks. 3. Achieves state-of-the-art results on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of explicit video modeling and the MVM pre-training task.4. Performs comprehensive experiments analyzing the impact of video encoding, pre-training data, and masking strategies. These validate the importance of temporal modeling and show that MVM accuracy correlates with downstream performance.In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end video-language architecture with explicit temporal encoding and a new MVM pre-training task that together significantly advance video understanding for retrieval and QA.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my understanding of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes an end-to-end video-language transformer model called VIOLET that adopts a video transformer to explicitly model temporal dynamics in videos and introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling to learn better video representations, achieving state-of-the-art results on video question answering and text-to-video retrieval tasks.
