# [VIOLET : End-to-End Video-Language Transformers with Masked Visual-token   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we design an end-to-end video-language transformer model that effectively captures both the temporal dynamics in video and the alignment between visual and textual elements for strong performance on video-language tasks?

The key points are:

- The paper presents an end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET) for video-language (VidL) modeling. 

- Previous works have taken a "imagify" approach by treating video frames as static images. This loses important temporal information in videos. 

- VIOLET uses a Video Swin Transformer to explicitly model temporal dynamics in sparsely sampled video frames.

- VIOLET also proposes a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM) to learn better video representations.

- Comprehensive experiments show VIOLET achieves state-of-the-art results on video QA and text-to-video retrieval tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling video temporal dynamics and learning better video representations will improve performance on downstream VidL tasks. VIOLET is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents VIOLET, an end-to-end video-language transformer model for video understanding. The main contributions are:

1. Proposes an end-to-end architecture called VIOLET that contains a Video Swin Transformer to explicitly model the temporal dynamics in videos, unlike prior works that simply pool frame features.

2. Introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM) that recovers masked video patches into a discrete visual token space. This is shown to be more effective than prior masked visual modeling tasks. 

3. Achieves state-of-the-art results on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of explicit video modeling and the MVM pre-training task.

4. Performs comprehensive experiments analyzing the impact of video encoding, pre-training data, and masking strategies. These validate the importance of temporal modeling and show that MVM accuracy correlates with downstream performance.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end video-language architecture with explicit temporal encoding and a new MVM pre-training task that together significantly advance video understanding for retrieval and QA.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes an end-to-end video-language transformer model called VIOLET that adopts a video transformer to explicitly model temporal dynamics in videos and introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling to learn better video representations, achieving state-of-the-art results on video question answering and text-to-video retrieval tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other recent research on video-language understanding:

- This paper proposes a fully end-to-end video-language transformer model called VIOLET. Most prior work relies on pre-extracted image or video features, while VIOLET is trained directly on raw video frames for greater flexibility.

- The model architecture incorporates a video Swin transformer to explicitly model temporal dynamics in videos. Other recent end-to-end models like ClipBERT and Frozen tend to simply pool frame features, which could lose important temporal information.

- A new pre-training task called Masked Visual-Token Modeling (MVM) is introduced. This is different from prior work on masked region/frame modeling and is shown to more effectively learn video representations for downstream tasks.

- VIOLET achieves state-of-the-art results on several text-to-video retrieval and video QA benchmarks. It outperforms ClipBERT, Frozen, and other methods on most tasks, demonstrating the benefits of the architectural designs and MVM pre-training.

- Compared to MERLOT, another recent model targeted at video QA, VIOLET achieves competitive performance with orders of magnitude less pre-training compute and lower input resolution. This suggests VIOLET is more efficient and practical.

- One limitation is that VIOLET currently only handles sparsely sampled frames, while some datasets may require modeling longer videos. Extending the approach to handle variable length full videos could be an interesting avenue for future work.

Overall, VIOLET pushes state-of-the-art for end-to-end video-language modeling by better incorporating temporal information and introducing a new pre-training approach. The results validate these design decisions over prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Extending the model to handle full-length videos with densely sampled frames. The current model uses sparsely sampled frames for computational efficiency. Handling longer videos with more dense sampling could improve performance on downstream tasks like video counting that require modeling full video sequences. 

- Incorporating additional input signals from videos beyond just RGB frames, such as audio. The authors suggest audio could provide useful complementary information to further improve video-language modeling.

- Scaling up pre-training with larger and more diverse video datasets. The authors believe pre-training their model on larger-scale video data could lead to further improvements in performance.

- Evaluating the model on additional video-language tasks like video captioning and video-dialogue. The current work focuses on video QA and retrieval, but the model could likely be applied to other video-language tasks as well.

- Exploring different architectures for the video encoder, such as 3D CNNs, that can also explicitly model temporal information. The current work uses a video Transformer, but other architectures could be examined.

- Improving cross-modal fusion mechanisms between video and language. Better fusing of the video and text representations could enhance the joint modeling.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling up the model with more data, evaluating on more tasks, incorporating additional video input modalities, exploring architectural variations especially for video encoding, and improving cross-modal fusion techniques. Advances in these areas could further improve video-language understanding using the end-to-end modeling approach proposed in this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents VIOLET, an end-to-end video-language transformer model for tasks like video question answering and text-to-video retrieval. VIOLET uses a video Swin transformer to explicitly model the temporal dynamics in video inputs, instead of simply pooling frame features. It also introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual Token Modeling (MVM) where the goal is to recover masked video patches in terms of discrete visual tokens from a pretrained DALL-E model. This helps the model better understand video scenes. Comprehensive experiments show VIOLET achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets for both video QA and retrieval. Ablations demonstrate the importance of explicit temporal modeling and the effectiveness of MVM under different pretraining settings. Overall, the paper demonstrates fully end-to-end training of video-language transformers, through temporal video modeling and masked visual token pretraining, can significantly improve performance on downstream VidL tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VIOLET, a fully end-to-end video-language transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics in videos for video-language learning. VIOLET contains three main components: Video Swin Transformer (VT) to model sequences of sparsely sampled video frames, Language Embedder (LE) to encode text, and Cross-modal Transformer (CT) to perform fusion. VT applies 3D shifted windows for spatio-temporal self-attention over sequences of frame patches. This allows explicit modeling of video temporal information, in contrast to prior works that use simple pooling or concatenation over individual frame features. 

The paper also introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM) which recovers discrete visual tokens for masked video patches. This avoids issues in prior works with predicting features or categories directly for masked regions. For pre-training, VIOLET is trained on a combination of image-text data (CC-3M) and video-text data (WebVid-2.5M and YT-Temporal-180M) with MVM, masked language modeling, and visual-text matching. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of temporal modeling via VT and the new MVM pre-training task. VIOLET achieves state-of-the-art on multiple text-video retrieval and video QA datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Violet, an end-to-end video-language transformer for tasks like video question answering and text-to-video retrieval. Violet contains three components: a Video Swin Transformer to model the temporal dynamics in sparsely sampled video frames, a language embedder to encode the text, and a cross-modal transformer to fuse video and text features. A key contribution is a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-Token Modeling (MVM), where video frames are quantized into discrete visual tokens using a discrete variational autoencoder. During pre-training, patches of video frames are masked and Violet must predict the original visual tokens that were in the masked patches. This improves video representation learning. Violet is pre-trained on a combination of large image-text datasets like Conceptual Captions and video-text datasets like WebVid and YT-Temporal. It achieves state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks by explicitly modeling video temporal information and learning better video representations via the proposed MVM pre-training task.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem this paper aims to address is how to build effective video-language transformers that can perform well on downstream tasks like video question answering and text-to-video retrieval. Specifically, the paper focuses on two key challenges:

1) How to effectively encode video frames to capture temporal information. Prior methods like ClipBERT tend to "imagify" videos by just mean pooling over individual frame features extracted from a 2D CNN. This loses important temporal dynamics in the video.

2) How to design better pre-training tasks for video-language modeling. While masked language modeling is effective, prior attempts at masked visual modeling like masked frame modeling have not been very useful. 

To address the first challenge, the paper proposes using a Video Swin Transformer to explicitly model temporal information in videos. For the second challenge, the paper introduces a new pre-training task called Masked Visual-token Modeling that helps learn better video representations.

In summary, the key questions addressed are:

- How to encode videos to retain temporal information for video-language modeling?

- How to design effective pre-training tasks to learn useful video representations?

The proposed methods are an end-to-end Video-Language Transformer using Video Swin Transformer for encoding and a new Masked Visual-token Modeling pre-training task. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on several video QA and retrieval benchmarks.
