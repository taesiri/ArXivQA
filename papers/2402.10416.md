# [Grounding Language about Belief in a Bayesian Theory-of-Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Beliefs are mental states that guide actions, but cannot be directly observed. Yet people frequently use rich, compositional language (e.g. "She seems to think she'll get the role...") to describe others' beliefs.
- What explains our ability to interpret such epistemic language given the hidden nature of beliefs? Prior work has not studied the semantics of belief sentences in everyday contexts.

Proposed Solution:
- Ground belief statements in a Bayesian theory-of-mind (BToM) model that infers goals, beliefs and plans that explain an agent's actions. 
- Translate belief statements (e.g. "The player believes there is a red key in box 1") into first-order epistemic logic.
- Evaluate truth value of logic formulas against BToM inferences to explain graded, compositional nature of belief attributions.

- BToM combines probabilistic inverse planning and real-time heuristic search to model goal-directed plans and actions.
- Use a large language model to translate English belief statements into logical form. 

Experiments and Results:
- Human subjects observed agent solving gridworld puzzle and made goal guesses and belief ratings. 
- Full BToM model correlates much better with human responses than non-mentalizing or heuristic baselines.
- Suggests theory-of-mind reasoning is crucial for interpreting language about beliefs.

Main Contributions:  
- Providing a computational account grounding semantics of epistemic language in Bayesian goal/belief inference.
- Demonstrating importance of theory-of-mind for interpreting compositional belief statements.
- Quantitative correlation of model predictions with human judgments.
