# [XLAVS-R: Cross-Lingual Audio-Visual Speech Representation Learning for   Noise-Robust Speech Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speech recognition and translation systems perform poorly when given noisy audio inputs, which are common in real-world settings. 
- Using visual signals (e.g. video of lips) along with audio can improve noise robustness, but audio-visual (AV) training data is limited, especially for low-resource languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a cross-lingual audio-visual speech representation model called XLAVS-R that achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks while using minimal AV supervision.

Key Points:
- XLAVS-R first pre-trains an audio-only representation on abundant unlabeled speech data across 128 languages. 
- Then the visual modality is injected and the model is trained on AV data in a simplified, single-round protocol to align representations.  
- Several architectural improvements are made over prior AV models like AV-HuBERT.
- Evaluated on the MuAViC benchmark for multilingual AV speech recognition and translation.
- Outperforms previous SOTA by large margins, especially for noisy test cases. Enables strong zero-shot AV ability.
- Shows the benefits of cross-lingual pre-training and effectiveness of the proposed training strategy that maximizes usage of available AV data.
- Relaxes the need for labelled AV data in downstream tasks. Enables tackling tasks like AV speech recognition without any transcribed AV training data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel single-round AV training scheme after large-scale audio-only pre-training.
- State-of-the-art results on MuAViC speech recognition (9 langs) and translation (6 X-En pairs). 
- Demonstrates strong zero-shot AV ability and noise robustness.
- First model to effectively scale up multilingual AV learning.
