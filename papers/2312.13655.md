# [Compositional Zero-Shot Learning for Attribute-Based Object Reference in   Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Language-enabled robots need to comprehend referring expressions to identify objects referred to by humans. However, the referred object may not be visible to the robot when referenced, and the number of objects and attributes can be unbounded in an open world. This makes referring expression comprehension challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper implements an attribute-based compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) approach to enable robots to identify unseen object-attribute combinations given a referring expression. 

- The approach disentangles attributes and object appearances from observed compositions using correlation matrices between images. It then composes seen attributes and object labels to predict unseen combinations.

- This allows generalizing to unfamiliar object-attribute pairs not seen during training.

Contributions:
- Formulates referring expression comprehension as a classification task using similarity between vision and language features.

- Introduces a CZSL approach to disentangle attributes and object classes into separate feature spaces.

- Enables prediction of unseen compositions of attributes and objects given a referring expression.

- Validates the approach on MIT-States and Clothing16K datasets for unseen pair retrieval.

- Deploys and tests the approach on a physical robot to identify unseen object-attribute combinations given a natural language command.

In summary, the key contribution is an attribute-based CZSL method to allow robots to comprehend referring expressions and identify unseen object-attribute combinations in an open world based on disentangled visual features and language priors.
