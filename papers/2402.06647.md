# [A Survey on Large Language Model Hallucination via a Creativity   Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper notes that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a tendency towards hallucination - generating incorrect or irrelevant information with high confidence. Much existing research has aimed to detect and mitigate these hallucinations, viewing them as limitations that compromise reliability. However, the paper questions whether hallucinations could also catalyze creativity within LLMs. 

Proposed Solution/Approach:  
The paper explores the potential interplay between LLM hallucinations and creativity. After reviewing taxonomies and research on mitigating hallucinations, the paper draws parallels to historical examples where human hallucinations sparked creative breakthroughs. Aligning with cognitive science theories linking hallucination and creativity, the paper advocates assessing if certain LLM hallucinations have creative value. It examines definitions and evaluation approaches for creativity from cognitive science, adapted for LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- Questions solely negative view of LLM hallucinations, exploring creativity potential 
- Reviews cognitive science research on human hallucination-creativity links  
- Discusses historical examples where hallucinations drove innovation
- Examines evaluating and measuring creativity in LLMs
- Systematically reviews literature on transforming hallucinations into creativity following divergent and convergent thinking framework
- Suggests future research directions e.g. richer datasets, optimizing methods to leverage hallucinations for creativity across modalities and applications

In summary, the paper provides a new perspective on LLM hallucinations, advocating not only mitigating risks but also assessing and harnessing creative potential, outlining an approach aligned with cognitive science creativity frameworks.
