# [Is Reference Necessary in the Evaluation of NLG Systems? When and Where?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Most automatic metrics for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems rely on human-written reference texts, but obtaining such references is challenging and limits the applicability of these metrics. Recently proposed reference-free metrics offer an alternative, but it's unclear when they can substitute for reference-based metrics. 

Solution:
The paper conducts a comprehensive assessment of both reference-based and reference-free metrics across diverse NLG tasks and evaluation criteria. Eight datasets spanning summarization, data-to-text and dialogue tasks are used. Metrics are evaluated on coherence, consistency and fluency criteria. Analyses include correlation with human judgments, perturbation tests, criterion-specific tests, and stability checks.

Key Findings:
- Reference-free metrics show higher correlation with human judgments overall and are more sensitive at detecting issues like incoherence or disfluency.  
- However, their performance varies across tasks based on the quality of the underlying generative model used. They struggle on dialog tasks and with uncommon input types.
- Reference-free metrics can identify low quality text but may not reliably score high quality text. Their effectiveness should be validated before applying them to new tasks or criteria.  

Main Contributions:
- Thorough benchmarking of metric performance that reveals strengths and weaknesses of reference-free vs reference-based metrics
- Demonstration that while promising, reference-free metrics have limitations related to task and input type
- Guidance on evaluating metric effectiveness on new applications via sampling and correlation checks
- Recommendations for selecting appropriate automatic evaluation metrics based on use case

The study provides valuable insights into when reference-free metrics can substitute for reference-based ones, and best practices for utilizing automatic metrics to ensure rigorous NLG system evaluation.
