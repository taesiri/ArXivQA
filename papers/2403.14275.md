# [Is Reference Necessary in the Evaluation of NLG Systems? When and Where?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Most automatic metrics for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems rely on human-written reference texts, but obtaining such references is challenging and limits the applicability of these metrics. Recently proposed reference-free metrics offer an alternative, but it's unclear when they can substitute for reference-based metrics. 

Solution:
The paper conducts a comprehensive assessment of both reference-based and reference-free metrics across diverse NLG tasks and evaluation criteria. Eight datasets spanning summarization, data-to-text and dialogue tasks are used. Metrics are evaluated on coherence, consistency and fluency criteria. Analyses include correlation with human judgments, perturbation tests, criterion-specific tests, and stability checks.

Key Findings:
- Reference-free metrics show higher correlation with human judgments overall and are more sensitive at detecting issues like incoherence or disfluency.  
- However, their performance varies across tasks based on the quality of the underlying generative model used. They struggle on dialog tasks and with uncommon input types.
- Reference-free metrics can identify low quality text but may not reliably score high quality text. Their effectiveness should be validated before applying them to new tasks or criteria.  

Main Contributions:
- Thorough benchmarking of metric performance that reveals strengths and weaknesses of reference-free vs reference-based metrics
- Demonstration that while promising, reference-free metrics have limitations related to task and input type
- Guidance on evaluating metric effectiveness on new applications via sampling and correlation checks
- Recommendations for selecting appropriate automatic evaluation metrics based on use case

The study provides valuable insights into when reference-free metrics can substitute for reference-based ones, and best practices for utilizing automatic metrics to ensure rigorous NLG system evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively assesses the performance of reference-based and reference-free automatic text evaluation metrics across diverse tasks and criteria, revealing their advantages, limitations, and appropriate usage scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper include:

1. The authors thoroughly investigate the performances of reference-free and reference-based automatic evaluation metrics through numerous experiments, revealing their inherent advantages and limitations. 

2. The authors find that reference-free metrics exhibit a higher correlation with human judgment and greater sensitivity to deficiencies in language quality across most datasets and criteria. However, their effectiveness varies across tasks and is influenced by the quality of candidate texts.

3. The authors provide guidance on the judicious use of automatic metrics to ensure the integrity of evaluations. They recommend assessing the performance of metrics before applying them to new tasks, especially when inputs are in uncommon form or when the answer space is highly variable.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis of different automatic evaluation metrics, when and where they can be effectively applied, as well as recommendations on their appropriate usage to prevent potential misdirection in system evaluations.

The paper compares reference-based and reference-free automatic evaluation metrics across different natural language generation tasks like summarization, data-to-text, and dialogue. It analyzes their performance using metrics like correlation with human judgment, perturbation detection, KS score, etc. on criteria like coherence, consistency, and fluency. It also examines the stability of these metrics across varying quality of candidate texts. The goal is to provide guidance on effectively utilizing automatic evaluation metrics based on their advantages and limitations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes automatic evaluation metrics as either reference-based or reference-free. Can you further explain the key differences in how these two types of metrics operate? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. The paper evaluates metrics across three core criteria - coherence, consistency, and fluency. Why were these particular criteria selected? Could other criteria also be relevant, and if so, what might those be?  

3. Reference-free metrics showed higher correlation with human judgments across most datasets and criteria tested. However, their performance varied significantly across different tasks. What factors may have contributed to this variance in performance?

4. The paper hypothesizes that reference-free metrics are more constrained by the quality of the underlying generative models on which they rely. How might the choice of underlying model impact the performance and reliability of reference-free metrics on a given task?  

5. Could you describe the perturbation analysis conducted in the paper in more detail? Why is the ability to detect degraded quality an important attribute for automatic metrics?

6. Beyond correlation analysis, the paper employs criterion-specific analyses like the KS test. Why are these additional analyses needed to thoroughly evaluate metric performance? What key insights do they provide that correlation alone does not capture?

7. The stability analysis revealed that both reference-free and reference-based metrics perform less reliably at system-level as quality improves. What might explain this trend? How could metrics be made more robust to system-level differences in quality?

8. The paper provides guidance on selecting appropriate automatic metrics based on task type. Do you think these recommendations are well-founded? How might they be expanded or refined based on the results presented?

9. What kinds of additional experiments could provide further insight into the appropriate usage conditions and limitations of existing automatic metrics? What new types of metrics could potentially address some of the limitations identified?

10. Beyond the metrics and tasks analyzed, how could the high-level methodological approach explored in this paper be leveraged to drive progress on automatic evaluation techniques more broadly? What other open challenges exist in this space?
