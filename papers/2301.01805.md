# [Unsupervised Manifold Linearizing and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01805)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to simultaneously cluster data points and learn a latent linear representation when the data lies on a union of nonlinear manifolds. 

Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:

1. How to transform the data from lying on nonlinear manifolds to lying close to a union of linear subspaces, so that subspace clustering techniques can be applied.

2. How to learn a latent representation that is both discriminative between clusters and preserves diversity within each cluster, without access to ground truth labels. 

The main hypothesis appears to be that optimizing an objective based on maximal coding rate reduction, along with learning a novel doubly stochastic cluster membership matrix, can achieve these two goals in an unsupervised manner.

The paper proposes a method called Manifold Linearizing and Clustering (MLC) to address this problem. The key novelty lies in optimizing the MCR^2 objective over both the latent representation and the doubly stochastic membership matrix.

In summary, the central research question is how to simultaneously cluster data on nonlinear manifolds and learn a structured latent representation, in an unsupervised way. The main hypothesis is that the proposed MLC method can achieve this effectively.
