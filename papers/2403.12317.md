# [EffiPerception: an Efficient Framework for Various Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for computer vision perception tasks like object detection and segmentation focus on improving accuracy but do not sufficiently consider inference speed and memory usage. 
- Methods are often specialized for specific tasks and modalities, lacking versatility across tasks.
- Models lack robustness against corruptions like noise.

Proposed Solution - EffiPerception Framework
- Efficient Feature Extractors
   - Image: Partition into patches, flatten and learn local features
   - Point cloud: Voxelization, random sampling, augmentation, flattening and local learning
- Efficient Layers 
   - Sparse DownSampling (SDS) - Aggregate and downsample 3D features
   - Global Spatial Aggregation (GSA) - Fuse 2D and 3D features effectively
- EffiOptim - 8-bit optimizer to reduce memory and accelerate training

Main Contributions:
- Proposes EffiPerception, a unified framework for efficient and versatile perception across tasks 
   - Evaluated on 2D detection, 2D segmentation, 3D detection and 3D segmentation
- Introduces SDS and GSA layers to improve efficiency and fuse features
- Shows consistent accuracy and speed improvements over strong baselines
- Demonstrates versatility by improving 11 model pairs across tasks
- Exhibits robustness against input corruptions like noise

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient and versatile perception framework called EffiPerception that focuses on improving common patterns across tasks. It introduces techniques like optimizer quantization, specialized layers for feature fusion and demonstrates consistent accuracy, speed and memory improvements over strong baselines across diverse tasks while maintaining robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

EffiPerception is an efficient deep learning framework for 2D and 3D computer vision perception tasks like object detection and segmentation that achieves improved accuracy, speed, and memory usage by exploring common learning patterns across tasks through efficient feature extraction, layer aggregation, and optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an efficient framework called EffiPerception to achieve better accuracy-speed performance with relatively low memory cost under several perception tasks like 2D/3D object detection and 2D/3D segmentation.

2. Investigating and exploiting common layer patterns and learning strategies among different perception tasks, and proposing two generic layers - Sparse Down-Sampling and Global Spatial Aggregation - to increase the framework's robustness and efficiency. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on COCO, KITTI and Semantic KITTI datasets over four perception tasks, showing significant overall accuracy-speed-memory performance improvements compared to earlier well-respected methods. The scalability of the framework also indicates its potential for training and deploying larger models on resource-constrained devices.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a versatile and efficient perception framework that works well across different tasks while achieving better accuracy, speed and memory usage compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. The focus on finding commonalities between tasks is what makes the framework generic and robust.
