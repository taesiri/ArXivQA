# [ModelGPT: Unleashing LLM's Capabilities for Tailored Model Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities in automating tasks. However, they struggle to meet diverse user needs efficiently and require substantial resources for training and deployment. 
- Average users lack expertise/resources to select and customize models for their specific needs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes ModelGPT, a framework to generate tailored AI models from user data or task descriptions using LLMs' capabilities.

Key Components:
- Requirement Generator (RG): Constructs prompts to summarize tasks and data patterns from user input. Outputs requirement in one sentence.
- Model Generator (MG): Determines appropriate model architecture based on requirement. Decodes requirement into model parameters.

Contributions:
- Explores an approach to artificial general intelligence by providing tailored off-the-shelf AI models with little data, time and expertise.
- Proposes a novel and user-friendly ModelGPT framework that leverages LLMs to translate user requirements into tailored small models in one forward pass.
- Experiments on NLP, CV and tabular data show ModelGPT generates models 270x faster than finetuning methods while maintaining performance.
- ModelGPT makes model generation more accessible to average users and shows potential in realizing AGI by combining strengths of general large models and specific small models.

Limitations:
- Granularity of model architecture selection needs enhancement.
- Efficiency of parameter generation module needs improvement.

Future Work:  
- More precise model architecture generation based on factors like task complexity.
- Alternate techniques for complex model parameter generation.
