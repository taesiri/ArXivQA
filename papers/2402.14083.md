# [Beyond A*: Better Planning with Transformers via Search Dynamics   Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Transformers and large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various natural language tasks, but still struggle with complex reasoning and planning tasks compared to traditional symbolic planners. The paper aims to address this limitation. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents "Searchformer", a Transformer model trained to optimally solve planning tasks like maze navigation and Sokoban puzzles. The key ideas are:

1) Train the Transformer to predict the "search dynamics" of the A* symbolic planning algorithm on randomly generated planning tasks. Specifically, log A*'s execution trace when searching for the optimal plan into a sequence of tokens encoding which states were added/removed from the search tree.

2) Fine-tune the Transformer with "expert iterations" to further shorten the predicted search dynamics while still outputting optimal plans. This moves past just imitating A* and finds more efficient search patterns.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces "search dynamics bootstrapping", a novel method to train Transformers to solve planning tasks by first predicting symbolic solver's dynamics, then optimizing to improve search efficiency.

- Achieves 93.7% optimal solutions on Sokoban with 26.8% fewer search steps than A* search, showing Transformers can move beyond traditional algorithms.

- Demonstrates including search dynamics in training data significantly boosts Transformer performance over solution-only training, especially in low data regimes. Enables data-efficient reasoning capability.

- Provides in-depth analysis and ablations quantifying the impact of search dynamics training and model sizes. Reveals model parameters matter less than type of training data.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative training methodology enabling Transformers to match or exceed symbolic solvers on complex planning tasks. This is an important step towards more capable and general neural reasoning architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Searchformer, a Transformer model trained to predict the search dynamics of A* that can then be fine-tuned to solve complex planning tasks like Sokoban puzzles in fewer steps than A* search.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Searchformer, a Transformer model that can solve complex planning tasks more efficiently than traditional symbolic planning algorithms like A* search. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a method called "search dynamics bootstrapping" to train Transformers to imitate and improve upon the search procedure of A* by predicting the execution trace of A*. 

- Searchformer is shown to solve unseen Sokoban puzzles optimally 93.7% of the time, while using 26.8% fewer search steps on average compared to A* search.

- In ablation studies, the paper shows that including the A* execution trace ("search dynamics") in the training data leads to better performance compared to only training on input-output pairs. Models trained with search dynamics are more data efficient and robust.

- The paper demonstrates how Transformers can move beyond just imitating an algorithm like A*, to discovering more efficient search patterns through fine-tuning. This shows promise for using Transformers for complex planning and reasoning tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an effective method to train Transformers to solve planning tasks by learning from and improving upon traditional symbolic planning algorithms. The Searchformer model outperforms A* search in terms of search efficiency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed search dynamics bootstrapping method allow the Transformer model to move past simply imitating A* search and find more efficient planning algorithms? What specifically happens during the fine-tuning steps?

2. Why is it beneficial to train the Transformer model on the execution traces of A* search rather than just input-output pairs of planning tasks and solutions? How does this allow the model to perform on-demand computation during inference?

3. The paper argues that predicting intermediate computation steps leads to more robust performance, especially in low data regimes. What evidence from the ablation studies on maze navigation support this claim?

4. How exactly are the training token sequences structured for both the "plan only" and "search augmented" models? What information is captured in each format and why is the search augmented format more informative?  

5. Why does the proposed method scale well to more complex planning tasks like Sokoban puzzles? How do the advantages of search dynamics bootstrapping manifest in tasks with larger state spaces?

6. Could the search dynamics bootstrapping approach be applied to imitation learning in other complex reasoning or decision making settings beyond planning? What would need to be adapted?

7. What are the limitations of relying on A* execution traces, given that they can grow exponentially long? How might curriculum learning or hierarchical planning help address these limitations?

8. How does the non-deterministic implementation of A* used during training induce additional variance into the length and contents of the execution traces? Why is this beneficial?

9. Beyond accuracy, what evaluation metrics are used to measure model performance on optimality and search dynamics length? How do these metrics demonstrate search improvement over A*?

10. The method trains models on purely synthetic data - could the approach be augmented with some natural language grounding to improve robustness? What challenges might this introduce?
