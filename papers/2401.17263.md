# [Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against   Jailbreaking Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called robust prompt optimization (RPO) to improve the adversarial robustness of language models against jailbreaking attacks by optimizing a set of trigger tokens to enforce safe and helpful outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new defense method against adversarial attacks on language models called robust prompt optimization (RPO). Specifically:

- The paper formalizes a realistic threat model and defense objective for protecting language models against jailbreaking attacks. This incorporates adaptive adversaries that can select the strongest attack against the current defense.

- The paper proposes the RPO algorithm, which directly optimizes a set of trigger tokens (a suffix) appended to prompts to minimize the chances of a language model generating harmful outputs even when under attack. RPO jointly optimizes the suffix to be robust to various attacks.

- Through experiments on multiple language models, the RPO suffix is shown to significantly reduce attack success rates across both known attacks it optimizes on and unknown attacks. It also transfers well to other models. The suffix achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness as a general defense while remaining simple and practical to use.

In summary, the key contribution is the RPO algorithm and defense suffixes it generates, which provide an effective, universal, and practical defense that sets a new benchmark for protecting language models against adversarial attacks. The formalized defense objective is also an important conceptual contribution.

The paper proposes a new defense method called "robust prompt optimization" (RPO) to improve the robustness of language models against adversarial "jailbreaking" attacks. It formulates defense objectives using minimax optimization and uses discrete optimization of "trigger tokens" to enforce harmless LM outputs even under adaptive attacks. The goal is to develop an effective, universal defense that also transfers across models. Key results include reduced attack success rates on various jailbreaking methods and retained performance on benign prompts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the robust prompt optimization (RPO) method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a realistic threat model that includes adaptive adversaries with access to multiple attacks. How does accounting for this difficult threat model in the formulation of RPO contribute to its effectiveness compared to prior defenses?

2. The defense objective formalized in the paper composes an inner minimization and outer minimization problem. Can you explain the intuition behind this formulation and how it relates to the overall goal of ensuring harmless LM outputs? 

3. The process of robust prompt optimization involves successive jailbreak selection and discrete optimization steps. What is the motivation behind incorporating adaptive attacks into the selection step? How does this differ from prior work?

4. Explain the gradient-based token optimization process in detail and discuss how directly optimizing the joint objective enables the creation of effective trigger tokens. What are the limitations of this optimization process?

5. The results demonstrate exceptional transferability to various unknown attacks. What properties of the RPO algorithm enable such strong generalization compared to prior defenses focused on single attacks?

6. Adaptivity is a key consideration in realistic threat models. Analyze the results on adaptive attacks like GCG and AutoDAN and discuss the factors behind why RPO succeeds where other defenses fail. 

7. The paper argues that semantic modifications alone are insufficient for an effective defense. Do you agree with this assessment? Why or why not? What are the relative benefits and limitations?

8. Discuss the effectiveness of RPO on various language models like GPT-4 and Vicuna-7B. How does transferability change across models and what factors affect it?

9. Propose and explain additional experiments that could further analyze the utility and limitations of RPO against continually evolving attacks. What future work is needed?

10. The results offer a more optimistic view on defending LMs from adversarial attacks compared to images. Do you agree that adversarial robustness is an easier problem for NLP? Justify your perspective.
