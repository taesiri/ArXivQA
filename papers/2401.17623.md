# [Neighboring Perturbations of Knowledge Editing on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17623)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating unintended text due to false or outdated knowledge encoded within their parameters. However, retraining LLMs is resource-intensive. Therefore, knowledge editing methods have been proposed to efficiently update the knowledge in LLMs without full retraining.

- Current knowledge editing methods and evaluations focus on whether the new target knowledge has been successfully incorporated into the LLM. However, they rarely explore the impact of editing on neighboring knowledge that is closely related to the new knowledge. 

- Specifically, it is unclear whether appending a new answer to an existing answer list for a factual question leads to 1) catastrophic forgetting of original correct answers, and 2) unintentional inclusion of incorrect answers from the list.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper introduces a new metric called "additivity" to assess the degree of perturbation to neighboring knowledge when appending new knowledge. Two factors are considered: relative ranking and absolute probability changes of answers.

- A benchmark called PEAK (Perturbation Evaluation of Appending Knowledge) is proposed with two datasets - PEAK-CF using counterfactual edits and PEAK-T using temporal, real-world edits.

- A framework called APP (Appending via Preservation and Prevention) is introduced that minimizes probability disruptions of both correct and incorrect neighboring knowledge when incorporating new knowledge. This helps preserve integrity of original knowledge and prevent noise.

Main Contributions:
- This work pioneers the exploration of neighboring knowledge perturbations when editing knowledge in LLMs. The new additivity metric and PEAK benchmark allow evaluating such perturbations.

- Experiments show that while current editing methods can effectively incorporate new facts, they significantly disrupt original neighboring knowledge and introduce unintended noise. 

- The proposed APP framework demonstrably mitigates neighboring perturbations and is compatible with multiple editing methods and LLMs.

In summary, this paper identifies the important but neglected issue of perturbations to neighboring knowledge when editing LLMs, and contributes both an evaluation benchmark and editing framework to mitigate this problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the perturbations to neighboring knowledge when appending new facts to large language models, proposes a metric and benchmark to evaluate such perturbations, and introduces a framework to mitigate them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It pioneers the exploration of neighboring perturbations via appending new knowledge to large language models (LLMs). A metric of "additivity" is introduced and a new benchmark PEAK is constructed for assessing the degree of perturbations in neighboring knowledge.

2. Through comprehensive experiments, it observes that although established methods and LLMs absorb new knowledge effectively, they seriously disrupt the integrity of original correct knowledge and introduce unintentional false knowledge. 

3. The plug-and-play APP framework is proposed which is shown to be effective in mitigating neighboring perturbations when appending new knowledge to LLMs.

In essence, the paper introduces a new perspective on knowledge editing by studying the perturbations it causes to neighboring knowledge, proposes a metric and benchmark to evaluate this, and develops a method to mitigate the issues discovered. It sheds light on an overlooked but critical aspect of editing large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Knowledge editing
- Model editing 
- Neighboring perturbations
- Catastrophic forgetting
- Unintentional noise
- Additivity 
- Perturbation Evaluation of Appending Knowledge (PEAK) benchmark
- Appending via Preservation and Prevention (APP) framework
- Relative ranking of objects
- Absolute probability change 
- Additive Forgetting Factor (AFF)
- Additive Noising Factor (ANF)

The paper explores the issue of neighboring perturbations when new knowledge is appended to large language models via knowledge editing techniques. It introduces metrics like additivity, AFF, and ANF to quantify the unintended forgetting of neighboring factual knowledge and inclusion of false facts. The proposed PEAK benchmark and APP framework aim to mitigate these detrimental impacts and preserve integrity of knowledge in LLMs when editing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "additivity" to characterize the impact of knowledge editing on neighboring knowledge. Can you explain in more detail how the proposed metrics of Additive Forgetting Factor (AFF) and Additive Noising Factor (ANF) quantify this impact?

2. The paper proposes a framework called APP (Appending via Preservation and Prevention) to mitigate negative impacts on neighboring knowledge during knowledge editing. Can you walk through how the different loss components of APP (L1, L2, L3) achieve the goals of preserving correct knowledge and preventing false knowledge?  

3. How does the paper construct the PEAK benchmark datasets to specifically evaluate the impact of knowledge editing methods on neighboring knowledge? What are the key differences between the PEAK-CF and PEAK-T datasets?

4. The paper shows lower efficacy and generalization scores on the PEAK-T dataset compared to PEAK-CF across editing methods. What reasons does the paper suggest to explain this gap? Do you think there could be other potential explanations?

5. For the additivity results, editing methods generally perform worse on the "Hard" false answer setting compared to the "Random" setting. Why do you think this gap exists?

6. The paper demonstrates how coupling existing editing methods with APP can significantly improve additivity while maintaining efficacy. But there is still substantial room for improvement. What future directions could help further enhance additivity during knowledge editing?

7. Could the objectives or framework proposed in APP be combined with existing methods beyond those experimented with in the paper? What challenges might this combination face?

8. The paper only considers the impact on neighboring knowledge when appending new answers to an existing answer list. What other types of knowledge editing operations could negatively impact neighboring knowledge?

9. The ablation study highlights the importance of the L1 loss in APP that maintains probability margins between correct and false answers. Why do you think this component is most critical for ensuring additivity?

10. The paper shows improved additivity metrics when using more neighboring answers in APP, but claims APP is still practical even with fewer answers. How could the tradeoff between computational efficiency and accounting for all neighboring knowledge be optimized in practice?
