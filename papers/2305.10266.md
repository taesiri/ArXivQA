# [Searching for Needles in a Haystack: On the Role of Incidental   Bilingualism in PaLM's Translation Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10266)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:What is the role and impact of incidental bilingualism - the unintentional consumption of bilingual signals - on the machine translation capabilities of large language models like PaLM?The key hypothesis seems to be that the large amounts of unlabeled multilingual data these models are trained on likely contains some amount of "incidental bilingualism" - examples of code-switching, translations, etc. - even though it is not explicitly curated parallel data. This incidental bilingual data may be partially responsible for the translation abilities the models exhibit.To test this hypothesis, the authors analyze PaLM's training data to quantify the presence of bilingual instances and translation pairs. They find that indeed there are sizable amounts of this incidental bilingual data. They then conduct experiments modifying and removing bilingual data from smaller PaLM models to analyze its impact on translation quality. The results suggest incidental bilingual data does contribute to translation capabilities, especially for smaller models.In summary, the main research question is: what role does incidental bilingualism in the unlabeled training data play in enabling the translation capabilities of large language models like PaLM? The central hypothesis is that it provides a partial signal that aids translation, which they find empirical evidence for.
