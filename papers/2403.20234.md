# [Artificial Neural Networks-based Real-time Classification of ENG Signals   for Implanted Nerve Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Peripheral neuropathies can severely impact quality of life. Implantable neural decode & stimulate (ND&S) systems that can analyze residual nerve signals and stimulate muscles/nerves show promise, but real-time signal classification remains a key challenge. 

- Human sensory response time limit is 300ms, so neural signal classification for ND&S must happen within this time frame. However, existing methods for ENG signal classification are not suited for real-time low-latency operation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores artificial neural network (ANN) architectures for real-time classification of sensory/motor stimuli from ENG signals measured using peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs). 

- A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ENG signal model is proposed to capture aggregate axon activities. This guides the design of spatio-temporal kernels in the ANN classifiers.

- Four ANN types are studied - CNN, InceptionTime, EEGNet-based ENGNet and LSTM. Their classification performance and latency are evaluated on an ENG dataset from rat sciatic nerves.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes an ND&S system architecture incorporating PNIs, ANN-based ENG classification and stimuli forwarding after nerve injury.

- Introduces a MIMO ENG signal model capturing multiple axon activities aggregated in the nerve. This model aids kernel configurations in the ANN classifiers.

- Compares four ANN architectures - ENGNet gives best tradeoff between classification performance (>90% F1-score within 100ms windows) and low complexity suitable for real-time operation. 

- Analysis provides insights into ENG signal classification boundaries for practical ND&S systems. ENGNet using 100ms windows emerges as most promising for real-time sensory/motor decode & stimulate applications.
