# [Passage Re-ranking with BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04085)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question addressed is:

Can a BERT-based model achieve state-of-the-art performance on passage re-ranking tasks with only a small amount of task-specific fine-tuning? 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) BERT's pre-training on a large unlabeled corpus makes it very effective as a generic language model.

2) Fine-tuning BERT on a small amount of labeled data from a target task allows it to specialize very quickly. 

3) Therefore, BERT can surpass previous state-of-the-art models on passage re-ranking with only a fraction of the task-specific training data.

The experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC-CAR datasets aim to test these hypotheses by fine-tuning BERT with varying amounts of training data and evaluating its performance relative to prior models. The results confirm the hypotheses, showing BERT achieves new SOTA with just 100k examples from MS MARCO.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a BERT-based passage re-ranking system that achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS MARCO and TREC-CAR passage ranking datasets. Specifically:

- They fine-tune a pretrained BERT model for passage re-ranking by feeding the query as sentence A and passage text as sentence B into BERT. The CLS token is used as input to a single layer neural network to predict passage relevance.

- When evaluated on the MS MARCO and TREC-CAR datasets, their BERT re-ranker substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art models like Conv-KNRM and IRNet. 

- They show BERT can reach strong performance after training on a small fraction of available training data. For example, BERT trained on just 0.3% of MS MARCO data outperforms IRNet by over 1 MRR@10 point.

- The code for their BERT re-ranker is made publicly available to reproduce the state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the key contribution is leveraging BERT for passage re-ranking to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on two key passage ranking benchmarks. The effectiveness of fine-tuning BERT with little in-domain training data is also highlighted.

- Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of transfer learning from large pre-trained language models like BERT for passage re-ranking. It sets a new state-of-the-art and provides a simple but strong baseline for future work to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Exploring different ways to incorporate BERT into the passage ranking pipeline beyond just using it as a re-ranker. For example, using it jointly with traditional IR methods like BM25 or as a reranker in a multi-stage pipeline.

- Pretraining BERT on domain-specific corpora to better adapt it to specialized search tasks like medical or legal search. 

- Exploring different negative sampling strategies during BERT fine-tuning to provide more useful training signals.

- Incorporating BERT's rich contextual representations into neural ranking models like KNRM and Conv-KNRM to replace their basic word embeddings.

- Leveraging BERT for other IR tasks like query reformulation, document expansion, query-document matching, etc. 

- Scaling up training with even more data from weak supervision signals to improve robustness.

- Combining BERT with other useful signals like page view statistics, anchor text, etc. for web search ranking.

- Adapting BERT architectures like replacing WordPiece tokenization to make it more suitable for ranking long texts.

- Developing techniques to efficiently serve BERT models for ranking in real-time search systems.

In summary, the authors point to many promising ways BERT can be incorporated into IR systems and optimized for ranking tasks as an important area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper describes using BERT, a pretrained neural language model, for query-based passage re-ranking. The authors fine-tune BERT for passage ranking on the MS MARCO and TREC-CAR datasets. Despite training on a small fraction of the available data, their method achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. For example, on the MS MARCO leaderboard their BERT-based model achieves an MRR@10 of 35.8, which is 27% better than the previous state-of-the-art. The authors argue that large pretrained models like BERT require much less task-specific training data to perform well compared to training from scratch. Their code and models are publicly available.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using BERT, a pretrained neural language model, for the task of query-based passage re-ranking. The authors fine-tune BERT on two passage ranking datasets - MS MARCO and TREC-CAR. Despite training on a small fraction of the available data, the proposed BERT-based models achieve new state-of-the-art results on both tasks, outperforming previous models by a large margin. On the MS MARCO dataset, BERT achieves over 35% MRR@10 on the dev and eval sets, compared to under 30% for previous best models. On TREC-CAR, it achieves 33.5% MAP on the test set, versus under 15% for BM25 and other neural ranking models. The authors argue that the same ingredients that enabled progress on reading comprehension are now available for passage ranking: large datasets like MS MARCO, and powerful pretrained models like BERT. They conclude that fine-tuning BERT leads to a simple but very effective passage re-ranker.

In summary, this paper shows that adapting BERT for passage re-ranking sets new state-of-the-art results on two key information retrieval datasets. The authors demonstrate that despite training on a small fraction of available data, BERT significantly outperforms previous neural ranking models as well as traditional methods like BM25. They suggest that the natural language understanding capabilities of BERT make it highly suitable for ranking document relevance. The proposed approach provides a simple but powerful way to leverage BERT for passage re-ranking in search and question answering systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper describes using BERT, a powerful pre-trained neural language model, for query-based passage re-ranking. The authors fine-tune a pretrained BERT model for a binary classification task to predict whether a passage is relevant to a query. Specifically, the query is fed as sentence A and the passage text as sentence B into BERT. The [CLS] vector output from BERT is fed into a single layer neural network to obtain a relevance probability score. These scores are computed independently for each of the top 1000 passages retrieved by BM25 for a given query. The passages are then re-ranked according to these relevance probabilities. The fine-tuning is done using a cross-entropy loss on the labeled query-passage pairs in the MS MARCO and TREC-CAR datasets. Despite training on a small fraction of the available data, this method achieves new state-of-the-art results on both passage re-ranking benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of passage re-ranking for question answering systems. Specifically, it is looking at using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to re-rank passages retrieved by an initial retrieval system like BM25 for a given query. 

The key questions or problems the paper is trying to address are:

- How can we leverage powerful pretrained language models like BERT for the passage re-ranking task in QA systems?

- Can fine-tuning BERT for passage re-ranking boost performance over previous state-of-the-art neural ranking models on benchmark datasets like MS MARCO and TREC-CAR? 

- How well can BERT perform on this task while only being trained on a small fraction of the available training data?

So in summary, the paper is exploring using BERT for passage re-ranking in QA to improve performance over prior methods, while utilizing BERT's ability to achieve good performance with less training data. The key goal is leveraging the power of pretrained models like BERT for this important component of QA systems.

This paper presents a BERT-based neural model for query-based passage re-ranking. The authors fine-tune a pretrained BERT model to score the relevance of a passage given a query, treating the task as binary text classification.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper describes using BERT, a pretrained language model, for query-based passage re-ranking in question answering. The authors use BERT as a binary classifier to predict if a passage is relevant to a query. The query is treated as sentence A and the passage as sentence B, with truncation applied so the total sequence length is under 512 tokens. The authors fine-tune a pretrained BERT model on the MS MARCO and TREC-CAR datasets. Despite training on a small fraction of the available data, BERT achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. For example, on MS MARCO, BERT Large obtains an MRR@10 of 36.5 on the dev set after being trained on only 12.8M examples, which is less than 2% of the available training data. The authors show BERT requires minimal in-domain fine-tuning data to achieve strong performance. The code to reproduce the results is made publicly available.
