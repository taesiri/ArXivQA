# [Real-World Atmospheric Turbulence Correction via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Atmospheric turbulence (AT) causes image and video distortion which negatively impacts computer vision tasks that rely on capturing clear imagery from outdoor environments. Existing methods to remove AT are trained on synthetic data but perform poorly on real-world data. There is a gap between synthetic and real-world AT distributions that needs to be addressed.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a real-world AT mitigation (Real-ATM) model using a domain adaptation framework to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world AT data. A teacher-student framework facilitates knowledge transfer from supervised learning on synthetic paired data to unsupervised learning on real-world unpaired degraded data. The teacher restores synthetic degraded images in a supervised manner. The student restores real-world degraded images by sharing weights with the teacher generator, discriminator, and reproduce net to enable unsupervised learning. A variational autoencoder learns image priors from the degraded data distributions.

Main Contributions:
- Construct an AT correction model using domain adaptation to link synthetic supervised learning and real-world unsupervised learning
- Propose a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer across domains through weight sharing of generator, discriminator, and reproduce net
- Demonstrate improved performance on real-world data in terms of image quality metrics and downstream person identification task

In summary, the paper introduces a domain adaptation method to mitigate real-world atmospheric turbulence by facilitating knowledge transfer from synthetic supervised learning to real-world unsupervised learning. Experiments demonstrate enhanced performance on real-world data for both image quality and a downstream computer vision task.
