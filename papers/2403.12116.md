# [Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Bio-Inspired Target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Unsupervised learning methods like self-supervised learning have high computational requirements unsuitable for edge AI hardware. Local learning rules like Hebbian learning are hardware-friendly but incompatible with supervised learning for semi-supervised approaches. There is a need for an unsupervised learning method compatible with both global and local rules and integrable with supervised learning.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a self-defined target generated from the network's output using two bio-inspired mechanisms - Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. WTA encourages different responses for different inputs while homeostasis balances neuron responses.

- This target enables an unsupervised loss calculation, allowing end-to-end training with global (backpropagation) and local (Equilibrium Propagation) rules. It is also compatible with supervised learning, enabling semi-supervised training.

Key Contributions:

- Competitive 97.6% accuracy on MNIST classification using the self-defined target with both backpropagation and Equilibrium Propagation in two-layer fully connected networks.

- Analysis shows improved accuracy and feature learning with the addition of a hidden layer, demonstrating the effectiveness of end-to-end training.

- Semi-supervised learning achieves 96.6% accuracy on MNIST using just 600 labels, outperforming prior arts. The method dynamically adapts the target based on label availability.

- Approach aligns well with hardware constraints, using a consistent loss formula and network architecture for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning applicable to neuromorphic implementations.

In summary, the self-defined target offers an effective unsupervised learning approach, achieving strong results with computational simplicity. It enables fully unsupervised and semi-supervised end-to-end training compatible with global and local learning rules suitable for energy-efficient edge hardware.
