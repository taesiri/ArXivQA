# [Inverse Submodular Maximization with Application to Human-in-the-Loop   Multi-Robot Multi-Objective Coverage Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10991)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of inverse submodular maximization (ISM) for human-in-the-loop multi-robot coordination. In standard multi-robot coordination based on submodular maximization, the reward/cost parameters are designed offline and then used online to coordinate robots by solving the forward optimization problem. However, sometimes human supervisors monitoring the robots may want to suggest different actions than those obtained from optimization, reflecting new information or changing requirements. The robots should be able to adapt by changing the internal parameters minimally while accommodating the human suggestions. This is framed as an inverse optimization problem called ISM.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a formulation of ISM where the goal is to find a new set of parameters that minimally deviate from the original ones, while making the greedy algorithm output actions that match the human's suggested actions. For an ordered suggestion set from the human, this reduces to a convex optimization problem with linear constraints. For an unordered set, it becomes a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) with exponentially many constraints. To solve this, a novel Branch & Bound based algorithm BB-ISM is proposed that searches over orderings without explicitly enumerating all constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a new type of inverse combinatorial optimization problem called Inverse Submodular Maximization (ISM)
- Proposes a novel BB-ISM algorithm to optimally solve ISM without explicitly enumerating exponential constraints
- Shows how ISM can be used in multi-robot coordination to account for human suggestions by minimally changing existing objectives
- Validates the approach on a multi-robot multi-objective coverage control problem. BB-ISM demonstrates significant speedups compared to standard MIQP solvers.

The key novelty is the formulation and algorithm for ISM to enable robot coordination objectives to adaptively incorporate human feedback while minimizing deviation from originally designed objectives requiring expertise. This allows occasional human guidance without needing redesign by experts.
