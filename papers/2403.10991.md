# [Inverse Submodular Maximization with Application to Human-in-the-Loop   Multi-Robot Multi-Objective Coverage Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10991)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of inverse submodular maximization (ISM) for human-in-the-loop multi-robot coordination. In standard multi-robot coordination based on submodular maximization, the reward/cost parameters are designed offline and then used online to coordinate robots by solving the forward optimization problem. However, sometimes human supervisors monitoring the robots may want to suggest different actions than those obtained from optimization, reflecting new information or changing requirements. The robots should be able to adapt by changing the internal parameters minimally while accommodating the human suggestions. This is framed as an inverse optimization problem called ISM.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a formulation of ISM where the goal is to find a new set of parameters that minimally deviate from the original ones, while making the greedy algorithm output actions that match the human's suggested actions. For an ordered suggestion set from the human, this reduces to a convex optimization problem with linear constraints. For an unordered set, it becomes a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) with exponentially many constraints. To solve this, a novel Branch & Bound based algorithm BB-ISM is proposed that searches over orderings without explicitly enumerating all constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a new type of inverse combinatorial optimization problem called Inverse Submodular Maximization (ISM)
- Proposes a novel BB-ISM algorithm to optimally solve ISM without explicitly enumerating exponential constraints
- Shows how ISM can be used in multi-robot coordination to account for human suggestions by minimally changing existing objectives
- Validates the approach on a multi-robot multi-objective coverage control problem. BB-ISM demonstrates significant speedups compared to standard MIQP solvers.

The key novelty is the formulation and algorithm for ISM to enable robot coordination objectives to adaptively incorporate human feedback while minimizing deviation from originally designed objectives requiring expertise. This allows occasional human guidance without needing redesign by experts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new formulation for inverse submodular maximization to enable robots to adapt their internal parameters for decision-making based on occasional human suggestions, in order to accommodate new requirements while minimally deviating from the original design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formulates a new type of inverse combinatorial optimization problem called Inverse Submodular Maximization (ISM) for human-in-the-loop multi-robot coordination. 

2. It proposes a novel algorithm called BB-ISM based on the Branch and Bound paradigm to solve the ISM problem.

3. It shows how ISM can be used in multi-robot coordination to account for human suggestions by minimizing changes to existing objectives.

4. It validates the proposed formulations and algorithm in a multi-robot multi-objective coverage control application, demonstrating advantages in running time and memory usage over standard integer programming approaches.

In summary, the paper introduces the novel problem of ISM, provides an algorithm to solve it, and shows its application for enabling robots to adapt existing objectives to human suggestions in a minimal way. The experiments then validate the approach over baselines.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Inverse submodular maximization (ISM): The main problem formulated and studied in the paper. It involves finding parameters of a submodular function such that greedy maximization yields a given solution set.

- Multi-robot coordination: The paper studies ISM in the context of coordinating teams of robots for coverage tasks. 

- Human-in-the-loop: The ISM problem is motivated by incorporating human suggestions/preferences in online robot coordination.

- Branch and bound algorithm: The paper proposes a branch and bound approach to solve the ISM problem by searching over possible orderings of the suggestion set.

- Mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP): The ISM problem with an unordered suggestion set is formulated as an MIQP, but this becomes intractable for large problem sizes.

- Submodularity: Key property exploited in modeling multi-robot coverage tasks, enables greedy approximation. ISM inverts this process.

- Multi-objective coverage control: Case study application for coordinating robots to detect stochastic events with different priorities.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around inverse submodular maximization, multi-robot coordination, human-in-the-loop interaction, branch and bound optimization, and coverage control tasks.
