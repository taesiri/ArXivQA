# [Feedback-Generation for Programming Exercises With GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores how to characterize the feedback provided by GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of OpenAI's large language model, when given a programming task description and student solution as inputs. Generating high-quality personalized feedback is important for supporting students learning programming, but is resource intensive for instructors. The goal is to evaluate if GPT-4 Turbo can automatically generate useful feedback.

Methodology 
The authors conducted a qualitative study using student submissions for two programming assignments from an intro Java course. 55 submissions spanning simple and more advanced tasks were input to GPT-4 along with the assignment descriptions. For each submission, feedback was generated 3 times to account for variability. The resulting texts were analyzed using qualitative coding to characterize the feedback. Metrics like accuracy were also calculated.  

Key Findings
- The feedback was highly personalized and compliant with assignments (100%). It had structure and addressed multiple issues.
- 52% of feedback was fully correct and complete. Issues included incorrect explanations, redundancies, and inconsistencies.
- Feedback length was extensive (median 360 words) and differed by task complexity.
- Applied suggestions resulted in fully correct solutions, showing improvement over prior LLMs.
- Useful information on optimizations and coding style was provided for most submissions.
- Accuracy was 84% overall in classifying submission correctness.

Conclusions
GPT-4 Turbo generates more reliable feedback than previous LLMs, with notable improvements in structure, completeness, and accuracy. However, issues remain around potential misconceptions and suitability for novices. Additional research is needed on integrating such AI feedback appropriately into courses and systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper explores the capabilities of GPT-4 Turbo to generate personalized feedback for introductory programming exercises by qualitatively analyzing the feedback provided for two assignments from a first-year programming course and finds improvements over GPT-3.5 but also remaining issues like inconsistencies and problematic explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a qualitative analysis and characterization of the feedback generated by GPT-4 Turbo for introductory programming exercises. Specifically, the authors analyzed the feedback provided by GPT-4 Turbo when given a task description and student solution as inputs for two introductory Java programming assignments. 

Through a deductive-inductive thematic analysis, the authors found that:

- The feedback was highly personalized and included both text explanations and code snippets/solutions. 

- Applying the suggested corrections always resulted in a fully correct solution, except in 2 cases. 

- However, only 52% of the feedback was fully complete and correct. The rest contained some inaccuracies, inconsistencies or problematic explanations.

- Compared to prior work with GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo showed improved performance in terms of feedback length, structure, accuracy, error localization etc. But issues still remained with misleading or incorrect feedback components.

In summary, the key contribution is an in-depth characterization of GPT-4 Turbo's feedback generation capabilities and limitations through a qualitative analysis of authentic student programming submissions. This helps inform whether and how GPT-4 Turbo could be integrated into educational settings to support novices learning programming.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper utilizes a qualitative research approach involving thematic analysis. What are some of the strengths and limitations of this methodology compared to a quantitative approach? How might the themes identified be further validated?

2) Two programming assignments are used to evaluate GPT-4 Turbo's feedback capabilities. How might using assignments from additional courses provide further insights? What other contextual factors could influence the feedback quality? 

3) The paper reports detailed statistics on various properties of the generated feedback. What additional quantitative analyses could be performed on the dataset to characterize the feedback, and what might they reveal? 

4) The authors evaluate the accuracy, precision and recall of GPT-4 Turbo's error classification. What are some limitations of using these metrics in this context and how might the analysis be extended?  

5) The paper identifies several categories reflecting inconsistencies and problematic explanations in the feedback. How prevalent are these issues and what techniques could be used to address them in an automated system?

6) How might the lengthy, complex, and disorganized nature of some feedback impact student learning outcomes? What strategies could improve clarity and scaffolding?  

7) The feedback contains many optimization suggestions beyond the original task requirements. How could an automated system determine which suggestions are appropriate for students at different levels?

8) What techniques could be used to tailor the linguistic complexity, vocabulary, and explanations in the feedback to different audiences? How might this affect student comprehension?

9) The paper notes privacy concerns with sending student data to third-party AI systems. What technical solutions could enable localized deployment while preserving output quality?

10) What empirical studies with students are needed to directly assess perceptions, utility and learning impacts of systems utilizing LLMs like GPT-4 for automated feedback generation?
