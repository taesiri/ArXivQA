# [Feedback-Generation for Programming Exercises With GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores how to characterize the feedback provided by GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of OpenAI's large language model, when given a programming task description and student solution as inputs. Generating high-quality personalized feedback is important for supporting students learning programming, but is resource intensive for instructors. The goal is to evaluate if GPT-4 Turbo can automatically generate useful feedback.

Methodology 
The authors conducted a qualitative study using student submissions for two programming assignments from an intro Java course. 55 submissions spanning simple and more advanced tasks were input to GPT-4 along with the assignment descriptions. For each submission, feedback was generated 3 times to account for variability. The resulting texts were analyzed using qualitative coding to characterize the feedback. Metrics like accuracy were also calculated.  

Key Findings
- The feedback was highly personalized and compliant with assignments (100%). It had structure and addressed multiple issues.
- 52% of feedback was fully correct and complete. Issues included incorrect explanations, redundancies, and inconsistencies.
- Feedback length was extensive (median 360 words) and differed by task complexity.
- Applied suggestions resulted in fully correct solutions, showing improvement over prior LLMs.
- Useful information on optimizations and coding style was provided for most submissions.
- Accuracy was 84% overall in classifying submission correctness.

Conclusions
GPT-4 Turbo generates more reliable feedback than previous LLMs, with notable improvements in structure, completeness, and accuracy. However, issues remain around potential misconceptions and suitability for novices. Additional research is needed on integrating such AI feedback appropriately into courses and systems.
