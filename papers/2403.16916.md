# [SCOD: From Heuristics to Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of selective classification in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, recently termed as SCOD. The goal is to design a predictor that can detect and abstain from making predictions on OOD samples, while minimizing errors on accepted in-distribution (ID) samples.

- Existing methods either focus only on detecting OOD samples or minimizing errors on ID data. They do not simultaneously optimize both objectives, as required in the SCOD problem.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows that the optimal SCOD strategy involves using the Bayes classifier for ID data and a selector modeled as a stochastic linear classifier in a 2D space. 

- The two input features to the selector are: (1) the conditional risk of the ID classifier, and (2) the likelihood ratio between OOD and ID data.

- This finding contrasts with suboptimal strategies used in existing OOD detection methods and the current state-of-the-art method SIRC for addressing SCOD.

- The paper also proposes a method called POSCOD to learn a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy from an ID sample and an unlabeled mixture of ID and OOD data.

Main Contributions:
- Derives the structure of optimal strategies for the SCOD problem, showing suboptimality of existing OOD and SCOD methods

- Proves that SCOD is not PAC learnable from only ID data in a distribution-free setting, revealing inherent challenges

- Introduces POSCOD - a novel method to learn plugin estimate of optimal SCOD strategy, outperforming existing approaches

- Provides theoretical grounding to guide future research towards effectively solving the SCOD problem

In summary, the paper formally defines the SCOD problem, characterizes the optimal solutions, establishes hardness results, and leverages the findings to propose a consistently better performing approach over state-of-the-art methods.
