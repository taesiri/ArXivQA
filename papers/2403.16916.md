# [SCOD: From Heuristics to Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of selective classification in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, recently termed as SCOD. The goal is to design a predictor that can detect and abstain from making predictions on OOD samples, while minimizing errors on accepted in-distribution (ID) samples.

- Existing methods either focus only on detecting OOD samples or minimizing errors on ID data. They do not simultaneously optimize both objectives, as required in the SCOD problem.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows that the optimal SCOD strategy involves using the Bayes classifier for ID data and a selector modeled as a stochastic linear classifier in a 2D space. 

- The two input features to the selector are: (1) the conditional risk of the ID classifier, and (2) the likelihood ratio between OOD and ID data.

- This finding contrasts with suboptimal strategies used in existing OOD detection methods and the current state-of-the-art method SIRC for addressing SCOD.

- The paper also proposes a method called POSCOD to learn a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy from an ID sample and an unlabeled mixture of ID and OOD data.

Main Contributions:
- Derives the structure of optimal strategies for the SCOD problem, showing suboptimality of existing OOD and SCOD methods

- Proves that SCOD is not PAC learnable from only ID data in a distribution-free setting, revealing inherent challenges

- Introduces POSCOD - a novel method to learn plugin estimate of optimal SCOD strategy, outperforming existing approaches

- Provides theoretical grounding to guide future research towards effectively solving the SCOD problem

In summary, the paper formally defines the SCOD problem, characterizes the optimal solutions, establishes hardness results, and leverages the findings to propose a consistently better performing approach over state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the Selective Classification in the presence of Out-of-Distribution data (SCOD) problem, demonstrates that the optimal SCOD strategy involves a Bayes classifier and a selector as a linear classifier in a 2D space, proves SCOD is not PAC learnable from only in-distribution data, and proposes a method called POSCOD for learning a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three key contributions to the problem of selective classification in the presence of out-of-distribution data (SCOD):

1. It demonstrates that the optimal SCOD strategy involves a Bayes classifier for in-distribution data and a selector represented as a stochastic linear classifier in a 2D space, using the conditional risk of the ID classifier and the likelihood ratio of ID and OOD data as input. This contrasts with suboptimal strategies from current OOD detection methods and the state-of-the-art SIRC method. 

2. It establishes that in a distribution-free setting, the SCOD problem is not Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learnable when relying solely on an ID data sample. This highlights the challenges of PAC learning for SCOD without access to OOD data.

3. It introduces POSCOD, a method for learning a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy from both an ID data sample and an unlabeled mixture of ID and OOD data. POSCOD simplifies the learning process and consistently outperforms existing methods empirically.

In summary, the paper provides important theoretical insights on the structure of the optimal SCOD strategy, its non-learnability from only ID data, and an effective practical method for learning a plugin estimate of the optimal strategy.

The paper addresses the recently proposed SCOD problem, which involves designing prediction models that can selectively classify in-distribution data while detecting and rejecting out-of-distribution inputs. It makes contributions in deriving the optimal strategy, establishing bounds on learnability, and proposing a practical algorithm called POSCOD for learning a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy. The key terms reflect the main focus areas and contributions around selective classification, out-of-distribution detection, optimal strategies, learning guarantees, and the proposed POSCOD method.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel corrected sigmoid model (CSM) for approximating the likelihood ratio $g(x)$. What is the intuition behind correcting the standard sigmoid and how does the correction term depend on the proportion of OOD data $\pi_O^{tr}$ in the unlabeled mixture?

2. Theorem 1 shows that the optimal SCOD strategy involves a Bayes classifier for ID data and a stochastic linear classifier selector. What key properties of the conditional risk $r(x)$ and likelihood ratio $g(x)$ make them suitable as input features to the selector?  

3. The paper proves that SCOD is not PAC learnable from only ID data. What assumptions would need to be made on the ID/OOD distributions for SCOD to become PAC learnable?

4. The proposed POSCOD method simplifies learning the optimal SCOD strategy to training an ID classifier and a binary classifier. Explain the loss functions used for each and how the threshold $\lambda$ is set.

5. What are the key advantages of the SCOD problem formulation used in the paper over alternatives such as one based on coverage constraint?

6. The corrected sigmoid model relies on the assumption that ID/OOD features are normal distributions after some transformation $\phi(x)$. When would this assumption fail and how would it impact performance?

7. Compare and contrast the linear scoring strategy and SIRC. Under what conditions can SIRC outperform the optimal linear strategy?

8. What are the practical benefits of the SCOD formulation being independent of the OOD proportion $\pi_O$? How does it influence the learning process and evaluation?

9. The paper introduces the area under SCOD risk-TPR curve. Explain what additional insights this metric provides over using only area under risk-coverage and AUC ROC.

10. If access to an unlabeled mixture of ID/OOD is not possible, what alternatives exist for learning good SCOD strategies? How do the assumptions differ?
