Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes using diffusion models as unified self-supervised image representation learners. Diffusion models have risen to prominence as a state-of-the-art method for image generation, denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, manipulation, etc. The U-Net architecture used in diffusion models generates diverse feature representations that the authors find are useful not just for the noise prediction task but also contain discriminative information for classification. The paper explores optimal methods for extracting and using these U-Net embeddings for image classification tasks. Careful feature selection in terms of U-Net block number and diffusion noise time step is important. The authors also explore different lightweight architectures like linear, MLP, CNN, and attention-based heads for leveraging the diffusion features for classification. Promising results are demonstrated on the ImageNet classification task, where diffusion models outperform comparable generative-discriminative methods like BigBiGAN. Transfer learning experiments on several fine-grained visual classification datasets also show promising performance of diffusion features, compared to self-supervised ResNet features. Centered kernel alignment is used to analyze diffusion model representations, comparing them internally across layers and time steps as well externally to other architectures like ResNets and Vision Transformers.In summary, this paper demonstrates that diffusion models can effectively serve as unified self-supervised image representation learners, with strong performance on both image generation and classification tasks. Careful feature selection from the U-Net architecture is critical, and lightweight classification heads can further improve results over simple linear probes. Analyses show diffusion features contain discriminative information comparable to other self-supervised methods. The work sheds light on the dual capacities of diffusion models and their potential as unified representation learners.
