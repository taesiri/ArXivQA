# [Anomaly Detection for Scalable Task Grouping in Reinforcement   Learning-based RAN Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03277)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a scalable framework for constructing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy bank that can optimize performance across a large number of cell sites (tasks) in a cellular network. The key innovation is the use of anomaly detection (AD) techniques to assess compatibility between sites and policies, in order to determine when policies can be reused versus when new policies need to be trained. The framework processes sites sequentially, cross-evaluating existing policies on new sites and using AD on the resulting interaction experiences to generate compatibility scores. Sites deemed compatible with existing policies are grouped together, while new policies are trained only for incompatible sites. The AD-based compatibility assessment provides computational savings by avoiding exhaustive training, while achieving equal or better performance compared to rule-based compatibility checks relying on key performance indicators. The paper demonstrates the framework on an inter-frequency load balancing problem using both classical and deep learning AD methods, showing superior efficiency over baselines. The overall process effectively groups together similar sites to be handled by the same policy, yielding a concise policy bank.
