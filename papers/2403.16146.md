# [Realtime Robust Shape Estimation of Deformable Linear Object](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating the shape of deformable linear objects (DLOs) like cables and wires in real-time is challenging due to their infinite degrees of freedom and susceptibility to occlusions or entanglements. 
- Existing vision-based methods using cameras have limitations in complex real-world environments like robot-assisted transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 
- Methods relying on markers on the DLO can fail when markers are occluded.

Proposed Solution:
- A robust pipeline to reconstruct the 3D shape of a fixed-length DLO in real-time using an optical tracking system (OTS) to localize markers.
- Introduce a novel probabilistic graph algorithm called Probabilistic Continuum Key Point Labeling Graph (PCLG) to determine order of scattered, unordered markers captured by OTS. 
- PCLG represents each marker as a node in graph, with edge weights representing probability that nodes are neighbors based on approximating DLO as piecewise constant curvature model. 
- Performs pruning to remove redundant edges, label points, then reconstruct shape using spline interpolation between labeled markers.

Main Contributions:
- PCLG labeling algorithm that is more robust to occlusions than prior marker-sorting methods, with 94.7% correct labeling rate during motion.
- Full pipeline using PCLG combined with spline interpolation to reconstruct DLO shape from unordered point clouds in real-time.
- Demonstrated accuracy within 1-2% for length and 2-4mm for radius compared to ground truth in simulations and experiments.
- Approach is validated on complex deformation and occlusion scenarios relevant for applications like robot-assisted TMS.

In summary, the key innovation is the robust PCLG algorithm for labeling marker point clouds to enable accurate DLO shape sensing under entanglements and occlusions in real-time without constraints on surroundings.
