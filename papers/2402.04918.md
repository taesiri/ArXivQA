# [Prompting Implicit Discourse Relation Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04918)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying implicit discourse relations (DRs) between sentences is a challenging NLP task, even for state-of-the-art supervised models. 
- Recent work showed that ChatGPT struggles with implicit DR classification when prompted with a standard multiple-choice format, achieving only 24.54% accuracy on PDTB 2.0.

Methods:
- The authors experiment with several alternative prompting strategies to improve ChatGPT's zero-shot inference of implicit DRs, using the latest GPT-4 model. 
- Methods include a two-step insertion of discourse connectives, per-class binary questions, and per-class verification questions that break down the multi-way classification.

Experiments:
- The methods are evaluated on the standard PDTB 3.0 benchmark and the crowdsourced DiscoGeM corpus. 
- Performance is compared to baselines and state-of-the-art supervised models. Both single- and multi-label predictions are evaluated.

Results:
- Sophisticated prompting does not improve accuracy over the multiple-choice baseline prompt. The best accuracy is 36.98% on PDTB 3.0, far below supervised models.
- Multi-label predictions better overlap with DiscoGeM's crowd annotations but accuracy for single labels is extremely low.

Conclusion:
- Implicit DR classification is still not resolvable by LLMs like ChatGPT in a zero-shot or few-shot setting. Supervised guidance seems necessary to map arguments to the abstract DR labels.  
- The results suggest current knowledge in LLMs does not transfer well to this subtle linguistic interpretation task involving world knowledge.

Limitations:
- Only one query made per method; variation between queries not analyzed. 
- Findings may not generalize to other DR frameworks or tasks.

Does this summary accurately capture the key points and contributions of the paper? Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the summary further.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates several prompting techniques to improve ChatGPT's ability to classify implicit discourse relations, but finds that even with sophisticated prompt engineering, the performance is still far below supervised models, suggesting that implicit discourse relation recognition may not be resolvable under zero-shot or few-shot settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates several proven prompting techniques to try to improve ChatGPT's performance on the task of implicit discourse relation classification. In particular, it experiments with breaking down the multi-way classification task into smaller subtasks, using prompting strategies that have worked well in crowdsourced annotation tasks. However, the experiments show that even with sophisticated prompt engineering, the inference accuracy hardly changes. This suggests that implicit discourse relation classification is not yet resolvable under zero-shot or few-shot settings using current language models like ChatGPT. The knowledge acquired from other reasoning tasks does not seem transferrable and supervised guidance is still necessary to map argument semantics to abstract discourse relation labels.

In short, the main contribution is the analysis showing that implicit discourse relation classification remains a challenging task that cannot yet be solved with zero-shot prompting techniques for ChatGPT and likely other current language models. The paper provides evidence that supervised learning is still required for good performance on this task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Discourse relations (DRs) - Semantic-pragmatic links between clauses and sentences that can be explicitly marked by discourse connectives or inferred implicitly. The paper focuses on classifying implicit DRs.

- Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) - A corpus of annotated discourse relations used to evaluate the methods in the paper.

- DiscoGeM - Another discourse relation corpus used in the evaluations.

- Pre-trained language models (LLMs) - Models like ChatGPT that are trained on large amounts of text data and can perform various language tasks without additional fine-tuning. 

- Zero-shot learning - Using LLMs to make predictions without providing any labeled training data from the task of interest.

- Few-shot learning - Providing an LLM with just a few examples to make predictions on a new task. 

- Prompt engineering - Carefully designing the input prompts to elicit the best performance from LLMs in zero-shot or few-shot settings.

- Discourse connective (DC) insertion - A method of annotating relations by inserting a connective word or phrase between the arguments.

- Multi-label classification - Allowing more than one label to be assigned to each discourse relation instance.

- Chain-of-thought prompting - Prompting LLMs to provide step-by-step reasoning for their predictions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The two-step DC insertion prompt adapts a method used for crowdsourcing annotations. Why was this method not as effective when applied to ChatGPT? What limitations of ChatGPT does this reveal?

2. The paper found that breaking down the multi-way classification into binary subtasks significantly underperformed compared to the baseline 14-way multiple choice prompt. What could be the reasons behind this? How could the threshold for detecting each relation sense be better calibrated? 

3. The paper shows that formulating the binary questions as verification questions improves performance compared to simple binary questions. Why might framing the question as an explanation help ChatGPT's inference capabilities? How else could the questions be re-framed?

4. The paper evaluates allowing multiple labels from the binary prompts, finding better overlap with human annotations. What are the challenges in eliciting multiple labels from ChatGPT, and how could the prompting approach be improved to produce more reliable multi-label predictions?  

5. Error analysis revealed confusion between certain relation types like CONTRAST and CONCESSION. What specific verification questions could help tease apart these fine-grained distinctions that ChatGPT struggles with?

6. The paper focuses on a simplified setup for implicit relation extraction, not dealing with intra-sentential relations. What additional complexities arise in identifying arguments and relations within a sentence? How could the method be extended to prompt full end-to-end annotation?

7. How transferrable are the findings to other types of semantic relations beyond PDTB-style discourse relations? What experiments could reveal the scope and limitations of zero-shot inference more broadly?  

8. The study uses the same model, GPT-4, for all experiments. How might performance and optimal prompting strategies differ across other large language models? What experiments could systematically compare models?

9. What risks or limitations are introduced when relying on the zero-shot predictions of large language models for annotation? How should the reliability be quantified when considering downstream applications?

10. The study focuses on the accuracy of classification, but does not evaluate the coherence or correctness of the generated relations. What analyses could be done to assess the overall discourse interpretation skills of LLMs without gold standard annotations?
