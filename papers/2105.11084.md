# [Unsupervised Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11084)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an unsupervised speech recognition system that can learn to map speech to text without any labeled data, relying only on unlabeled speech audio and unlabeled text?The key hypothesis is that by leveraging high-quality self-supervised speech representations from the wav2vec 2.0 model to segment and embed the speech audio, and using adversarial training to learn a mapping to phonemes, it is possible to train an accurate unsupervised speech recognition model. The paper shows that their proposed wav2vec-U system achieves significantly lower error rates compared to prior unsupervised methods, reducing the phoneme error rate on TIMIT from 26.1 to 11.3. On the Librispeech benchmark, wav2vec-U achieves a word error rate of 5.9 on the test-other set, rivaling some of the best supervised systems trained on 960 hours of labeled data.In summary, the central research question is how to develop an unsupervised speech recognition system, with the key hypothesis being that leveraging self-supervised representations and adversarial training can enable building accurate models without any labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the viability of this approach across various benchmarks and languages.
