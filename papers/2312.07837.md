# [Synthetic Data: Can We Trust Statistical Estimators?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07837)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper empirically investigates the statistical properties and inferential utility of estimators based on synthetic data generated by both statistical and deep learning approaches. Through a simulation study, the authors demonstrate that naively analyzing synthetic data as if they were real leads to biased estimators with underestimated standard errors. This results in inflated false positive rates, even for unbiased estimators. A key reason is that the uncertainty from the synthetic data generation process is ignored. While a corrected standard error is proposed to account for some of this excess variability, it only works for parametric models. For deep generative models, the regularization bias causes slower convergence, so the corrected standard error still underestimates the empirical standard error. Before releasing synthetic data to enable wider data sharing, the authors argue it is essential to develop specialized statistical inference tools for such data that properly handle the additional variability. The findings highlight deep generative models pose particular methodological challenges regarding accurate uncertainty quantification and assessing estimator performance.
