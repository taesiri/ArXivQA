# [FCDS: Fusing Constituency and Dependency Syntax into Document-Level   Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to identify relations between entities in a document. It requires handling long texts and reasoning over multiple sentences. Prior works have used pre-trained language models or graph structures to model interactions between entities. However, they do not fully exploit the rich syntactic information in the document.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel approach to fuse constituency and dependency syntax for DocRE. The key ideas are:

1) Use constituency syntax to aggregate sentence-level information and select informative sentences. Process the constituency tree with Tree-LSTM.

2) Construct a dependency graph and process it with GCN. Use constituency information to enhance the dependency graph - fuse sentence root features, add document node to connect sentences.  

3) Extract shortest path between entities in dependency graph. Learn a dynamic fusion weight to combine scores from constituency tree and enhanced dependency graph.

Main Contributions:

- Novel fusion of complementary constituency and dependency syntax to incorporate syntactic information at different granularity for DocRE.

- Enhance dependency graph with constituency features and document node to simplify interactions and capture long-distance relations.  

- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on DocRED, CDR and GDA datasets, significantly outperforming prior syntax-based and BERT-based methods.

- Analysis confirms contributions of different components and efficacy of document nodes in reducing entity distances.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective way to fuse different syntactic information to improve document-level relation extraction. Both constituency and dependency syntax as well as their fusion lead to performance gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel document-level relation extraction model that fuses constituency and dependency syntax to enhance relation reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing to utilize the constituency tree to aggregate sentence-level information to compensate for the gap in the dependency tree and improve the dependency graph by adding a document node to reduce the distance of entity pairs and simplify long-sentence interaction.

2. Processing the dependency graph and the constituency tree with Tree-LSTM and GCN respectively, and setting a learnable parameter to adjust their weights. 

3. Experimental results demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on three DocRE benchmarks, especially on DocRED where the model improves the IgnF1 of state-of-the-art methods by at least 1.56%.

So in summary, the main contributions are using both constituency and dependency syntax information to enhance relation extraction, fusing them in a novel way, and showing improved performance over prior methods on multiple datasets.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Document-level relation extraction (DocRE)
- Dependency syntax

- Tree-LSTM
- Graph neural network (GNN)

- Dynamic weighted fusion

The paper proposes a novel model called "Fusing Constituency and Dependency Syntax (FCDS)" for document-level relation extraction. The key idea is to fuse both constituency and dependency syntax to better capture relations, especially long-distance relations, between entity pairs in a document. It utilizes dependency graphs and constituency trees to incorporate the syntax information, processes them using GNN and Tree-LSTM respectively, and fuses them together dynamically for relation classification. So the core focus is on exploiting and fusing dual syntax information to enhance performance on the DocRE task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to fuse constituency and dependency syntax into document-level relation extraction. What are the key differences between constituency syntax and dependency syntax and how do they provide complementary information for relation extraction?

2. The paper constructs both a constituency tree and a dependency graph from the input text. Explain in detail how each of these syntactic representations are constructed and what kind of nodes and edges they contain. 

3. The constituency tree is encoded using a Tree-LSTM while the dependency graph is encoded using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Why are these particular neural architectures suitable for encoding the tree and graph structures respectively?

4. The root node representations from the constituency tree are used to enhance the dependency graph. Specifically, how are the root nodes combined with the sentence nodes in the dependency graph? Why is this enhancement helpful?

5. The dependency graph contains a document-level node that connects to all the sentence-level nodes. Explain the purpose of adding this node and how it impacts modeling long-range dependencies between entities. 

6. The predictions from the constituency tree and enhanced dependency graph are combined using a weighted sum. How is the weight parameter $\eta$ determined? Analyze the learning curve of $\eta$ shown in Figure 3.

7. The ablation study shows that both the constituency tree and dependency graph make significant contributions to performance. Speculate on why removing either syntax representation causes a substantial drop in F1 score.

8. The case study highlights an example where shortcuts in the dependency graph path fail to capture a key relation keyword. Explain how the constituency tree augmentation is designed to overcome this limitation.

9. The model achieves especially strong performance gains on the biomedical CDR and GDA datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art models. What properties of these datasets might allow the syntactic enhancements to be more impactful?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on incorporating constituency and dependency syntax. Can you think of other linguistic annotations that could complement these existing signals? Suggest additional syntactic, semantic or discourse-based annotations to explore.
