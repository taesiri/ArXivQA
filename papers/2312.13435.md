# [Adversarial Markov Games: On Adaptive Decision-Based Attacks and   Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Machine learning models remain vulnerable to decision-based attacks (queries that only access hard labels) despite defenses like adversarial training. These attacks pose a realistic threat as they can match white-box attacks in effectiveness.
- Most defenses are evaluated against non-adaptive attacks, leading to unreliable assessments. Attacks should be adaptive, meaning they can self-optimize attack parameters and invent controls to evade defenses.  

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a framework called "Adversarial Markov Games (AMG)" to model the interaction between adaptive attacks and defenses. This is a sequential, competitive game.
- Demonstrate attacks can optimize policies to evade defenses in a black-box manner through an "adversarial policy gradient", despite no access to model gradients.  
- Show active defenses are necessary to complement adversarial training, but insufficient against adaptive attacks. Defenses thus also need to be adaptive, optimized through interaction.
- Empirically evaluate adaptive attacks and defenses on image classification over a range of scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- A theoretical analysis and AMG framework for studying interactions of adaptive attacks and defenses.
- Proof that black-box attacks can fully optimize evasion and performance in a gradient-based manner.
- Demonstration through extensive experiments that adaptive attacks outperform baselines and bypass defenses, necessitating adaptive defenses in response.
- Introduction of a novel active defense methodology and adaptations of existing attacks to make them self-optimizing.
- Highlighting the need for adaptive evaluations in adversarial ML, with attacks and defenses that can self-optimize through environment interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework called Adversarial Markov Games for modeling the interaction between adaptive decision-based attacks and defenses on machine learning models, and shows theoretically and empirically that active defenses are necessary but insufficient against such attacks without also being adaptive.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Demonstrating that active defenses against decision-based attacks are a necessary complement to model hardening defenses like adversarial training, but are not sufficient on their own. Active defenses can be bypassed by self-adaptive attackers, necessitating self-adaptive defenses as well.

2) Introducing a unified framework called "Adversarial Markov Games" (AMG) to reason about and assess self-adaptive attacks and defenses that adapt through direct interaction. The framework shows how attacks can jointly optimize their policy and evade active detection.

3) Providing an extensive empirical evaluation in image classification validating the theoretical analysis. The results show that self-adaptation through reinforcement learning outperforms baseline attacks, evasion techniques, and model hardening defenses like adversarial training.

In summary, the main contribution is theoretically and empirically demonstrating the need for self-adaptive attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning, rather than just one-time adapted attacks and defenses. The introduced AMG framework facilitates reasoning and assessment of such self-adaptive adversaries.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Decision-based attacks: Black-box adversarial attacks that rely only on the hard label outputs of a model to construct adversarial examples.

- Active defenses: Defensive methods like rejection or misdirection that take direct action on queries rather than just hardening the model. 

- Adaptive attacks/defenses: Attacks or defenses that can automatically tune their parameters and policies in response to their environment and other agents, going beyond just having knowledge of defenses to bypass them.

- Self-adaptive: A key concept introduced in the paper, referring to both inventing new attack/defense capabilities (like evasion techniques) as well as tuning them optimally and jointly. 

- Adversarial Markov Games (AMG): A framework proposed to model the competitive interactions between adaptive attacks and defenses as a game.

- Adversarial policy gradient: A theorem showing that black-box attacks can actually optimize evasion in a gradient-based way by adapting their policy, despite the lack of gradient access.

- Evasive transformations: Input transformations that attacks can employ to bypass similarity-based defenses while preserving attack functionality. Their control is also shown to be adaptable.

Some other terms include adversarial training, adversarial examples, robustness, evasion, threat modeling, recursive reasoning, opponent modeling, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Adversarial Markov Game (AMG) framework allow for reasoning and assessment of the vulnerabilities of AI-based systems? What are the key components of the AMG tuple and how do they capture the interactions between attacks and defenses?

2. The paper introduces a novel twofold definition of "adaptive" - both inventing new methods to evade defenses and adapting one's policy in response to other agents. How is this definition more expansive than the conventional notion of adaptive attacks in adversarial machine learning? 

3. The Adversarial Policy Gradient theorem shows that gradient-based optimization of evasive adversarial policies is possible even in black-box contexts. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this result. What are the implications for defenses against decision-based attacks?

4. Active defenses like rejection or misdirection are shown to be necessary but insufficient against adaptive adversaries. Explain why this is the case through the arguments laid out in Propositions 1 and 2. 

5. What modifications need to be made to existing decision-based attacks like Boundary Attack and HSJA to make them adaptive? What new parameters and controls can be introduced?

6. The evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of adaptive attacks compared to baseline versions. What metrics and datasets are used to validate this? How do the results change with adversarial training?

7. Explain the process of jointly optimizing attack performance and evasiveness using the AMG framework. What are some key rewards and states that enable this optimization? 

8. How does the concept of recursive reasoning apply in the context of AMGs? Why is 0th level recursive reasoning employed in the empirical evaluation?

9. What are some limitations of the proposed approach for adversarial evaluations? How can the framework be extended to other domains and modalities in future work?

10. Beyond accuracy and robustness tradeoffs, what broader implications does the arms race between attacks and defenses have on the development of general and trustworthy AI systems?
