# [Adversarial Markov Games: On Adaptive Decision-Based Attacks and   Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Machine learning models remain vulnerable to decision-based attacks (queries that only access hard labels) despite defenses like adversarial training. These attacks pose a realistic threat as they can match white-box attacks in effectiveness.
- Most defenses are evaluated against non-adaptive attacks, leading to unreliable assessments. Attacks should be adaptive, meaning they can self-optimize attack parameters and invent controls to evade defenses.  

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a framework called "Adversarial Markov Games (AMG)" to model the interaction between adaptive attacks and defenses. This is a sequential, competitive game.
- Demonstrate attacks can optimize policies to evade defenses in a black-box manner through an "adversarial policy gradient", despite no access to model gradients.  
- Show active defenses are necessary to complement adversarial training, but insufficient against adaptive attacks. Defenses thus also need to be adaptive, optimized through interaction.
- Empirically evaluate adaptive attacks and defenses on image classification over a range of scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- A theoretical analysis and AMG framework for studying interactions of adaptive attacks and defenses.
- Proof that black-box attacks can fully optimize evasion and performance in a gradient-based manner.
- Demonstration through extensive experiments that adaptive attacks outperform baselines and bypass defenses, necessitating adaptive defenses in response.
- Introduction of a novel active defense methodology and adaptations of existing attacks to make them self-optimizing.
- Highlighting the need for adaptive evaluations in adversarial ML, with attacks and defenses that can self-optimize through environment interaction.
