# [RefuteBench: Evaluating Refuting Instruction-Following for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ChatGPT are designed to interact with users through multiple rounds of instructions and responses. Users often provide feedback on the model's responses hoping for the model to update its outputs accordingly.  
- However, it's unclear if LLMs can appropriately handle refuting instructions from users to correct their initial responses. There is a need to evaluate how "stubborn" LLMs are to modifying their outputs when given contradictory feedback.

Proposed Solution - RefuteBench Benchmark:
- The paper proposes a benchmark called RefuteBench to evaluate LLMs' stubbornness and resistance to user feedback. 
- It covers tasks like question answering, machine translation and email writing. 
- The key measure is whether models can positively accept refuting feedback and consistently adhere to updated user demands throughout the conversation.
- Both single-feedback and multi-feedback dialog settings are considered.

Key Findings:
- All evaluated LLMs demonstrate stubbornness to some degree and inclination to their own internal knowledge. GPT-4 and Claude-2 show the most flexibility.  
- Generalizing feedback to new contexts is challenging for models, with 10-20% performance drop compared to applying feedback to the same context.
- As dialog length increases, models tend to forget user feedback and revert back to their original responses.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive benchmark (RefuteBench) to evaluate LLMs' responsiveness to refuting instructions.
- Analysis of multiple major LLMs on the benchmark reveals their stubbornness and difficulty in adhering to updated demands. 
- Proposed a simple yet effective "recall-and-repeat" prompt strategy to significantly boost performance.

The paper takes an important step towards testing and improving LLMs' capacity to interact with users through instruction-response-feedback cycles. The findings and benchmark could enable better human-AI interaction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new benchmark called RefuteBench to evaluate how well large language models can accept refuting instructions from users and consistently follow them. RefuteBench covers tasks like question answering, machine translation, and email writing.

2. It analyzes the performance of several state-of-the-art large language models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude-2, etc. on the RefuteBench benchmark. The key findings are:

- Models tend to be stubborn, i.e., they show inclination to adhere to their internal knowledge instead of accepting user feedback.

- Generalizing feedback to new queries is more challenging than simply memorizing the feedback.

- As the length of conversation increases, models tend to gradually forget user feedback.

3. It proposes a simple and effective "recall-and-repeat" strategy to improve model responsiveness to user feedback by retrieving relevant feedback and asking models to confirm and repeat it before responding. This is shown to significantly boost performance.

In summary, the paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate model stubbornness, analyzes model behaviors, and proposes a method to enhance adherence to user feedback in dialog scenarios.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Refuting instructions - Instructions from a user that contradict or refute the language model's previous response, used to provide feedback and update the model's knowledge/responses. A core concept in the paper.

- RefuteBench - The novel benchmark proposed in the paper to evaluate language models' ability to follow refuting instructions. Includes single-feedback and multi-feedback settings across tasks like QA, machine translation, email writing.

- Stubbornness - The paper analyzes how "stubborn" or resistant different language models are to changing their responses when given refuting instructions that contradict their knowledge.

- Feedback acceptance (FA) - A metric proposed to quantify whether language models positively accept/adopt refuting feedback in their immediate response. 

- Response rate (RR) - Another metric to measure if refuting instructions are correctly applied by the model to appropriate scenarios. 

- Recall-and-repeat - A strategy introduced in the paper to improve language models' responsiveness to feedback by retrieving relevant prior instructions and prompting the model to repeat them.

- Knowledge retention, multilinguality, writing proficiency - Key capabilities tested across the QA, machine translation, and email writing tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "recall-and-repeat" prompting method to improve LLMs' ability to follow refuting instructions. Can you explain in detail how this method works and what are the key components? 

2. The recall-and-repeat method uses a classifier to select the most relevant previous user feedback for the current query. What is the architecture of this classifier model and what kind of training data is used?

3. How exactly is the selected feedback incorporated into the prompt in the recall-and-repeat method? Why is asking the model to explicitly repeat the feedback before answering the query important?

4. The paper shows significant improvements from using the recall-and-repeat method. Can you analyze the results and explain why this method is so effective compared to vanilla prompting? 

5. Could the recall-and-repeat method be applied to other tasks beyond QA and MT that are studied in the paper? What adaptations would need to be made?

6. The paper identifies "stubbornness" of LLMs as a key issue limiting their ability to follow refuting instructions. Can you elaborate on what causes this stubbornness and how the recall-and-repeat method specifically targets it?  

7. What are some potential limitations or weaknesses of the proposed recall-and-repeat method? Under what circumstances might it not be as effective?

8. The authors use GPT-4 to evaluate whether model responses positively accept user feedback. What are the trade-offs of using GPT-4 versus human annotations for this?

9. Could the recall-and-repeat idea be integrated with existing memory mechanisms in LLMs? What benefits might this provide?

10. The paper studies single-feedback and multi-feedback scenarios. Why is the multi-feedback case more challenging? How could the method be further improved to handle long conversations with many refuting instructions?
