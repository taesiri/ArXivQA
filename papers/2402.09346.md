# [Developing a Framework for Auditing Large Language Models Using   Human-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09346)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- As large language models (LLMs) become more pervasive, auditing them for potential issues like bias, inconsistencies, and hallucination is important but challenging. 
- An effective auditing method is to probe the LLM with different versions of the same question to expose inconsistencies, indicating potential for bias or hallucination. 
- However, generating such probes reliably and at scale requires an automated approach. Using the same LLM leads to circular reliance, while using a different LLM needs assurance about probe validity.

Proposed Solution:
- A 2-phase framework with human-in-the-loop (HIL) validation:
  - Phase 1: Probe Generation by LLM1
    - Develop codebook and rating system for human assessors 
    - Iteratively improve prompt template to generate probes, assessed by humans
  - Phase 2: Probe Answering by LLM2
    - Different LLM generates responses to probes

Key Contributions:
- HIL validation of probes generated by an LLM, ensuring verifiability and transparency
- A general framework for auditing LLM responses using probe generation and answering, improving scientific rigor 
- Analysis demonstrating feasibility of generating reliable probes to audit hallucination in a QA dataset, using one LLM to probe another

The framework leverages human oversight to create a reliable prompt template in Phase 1. Phase 2 uses this to generate probes that are answered by a different LLM. Experiments showed probes can uncover inconsistencies in LLM responses, indicating issues like potential for hallucination. The criteria and process is generalizable for auditing various LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-phase framework with human-in-the-loop validation for auditing large language models by generating probes from one LLM and evaluating responses from another LLM to uncover inconsistencies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Validating probes generated by LLMs using a human-in-the-loop (HIL) approach to ensure verifiability, transparency, and minimize subjectivity. 

2. Proposing a practical and generalizable framework for auditing LLM-generated responses that increases scientific rigor and generalizability in assessing inconsistencies of LLMs. 

3. Conducting experiments using two LLMs to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework in auditing hallucination within the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains real-world style questions.

So in summary, the key contribution is a new auditing framework with human verification for probing inconsistencies in LLM responses, applied specifically to auditing hallucination in an experiment, but intended to be general enough for auditing other issues as well.

The paper presents a framework for auditing large language models using human-in-the-loop validation of probe questions. It focuses specifically on auditing for hallucinations and inconsistencies in LLM responses to questions from the TruthfulQA dataset. Key elements include generating probe variations of questions using one LLM, having humans evaluate the probes, and then using the probes to audit the responses of a second LLM to identify issues like hallucination. Relevant metrics examined include semantic similarity scores and agreement rates between probes, responses, and ground truth answers. The proposed approach aims to increase rigor and transparency in auditing LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a two-phase framework for auditing LLMs. Can you elaborate on why a two-phase approach was chosen over a single phase? What are the advantages of separating probe generation and probe answering? 

2. The framework utilizes two different LLMs - one for probe generation and another for answering probes. What was the rationale behind using separate models rather than relying on a single LLM? How does this approach avoid potential issues with circular validation?

3. Human-in-the-loop validation plays a key role in Phase 1 of the framework. Why was it important to have human oversight during probe generation? In what ways does this increase transparency and rigor compared to fully automated approaches?

4. The paper applies the framework specifically for auditing hallucination. Do you think the overall methodology could be extended to audit other properties like bias or toxicity? Would any modifications be needed to tailor it to other use cases?  

5. Can you walk through how the iterative refinement process worked in developing the codebook? What steps were involved in revising definitions and examples to improve inter-annotator agreement?  

6. The paper evaluates semantic similarity at multiple stages - between original questions and probes, among probes themselves etc. What insights do you think this granular analysis provides about the model's behavior? 

7. How exactly does presenting multiple variations of the same question allow one to audit different aspects of the LLM's capabilities? Can you expand on this with some concrete examples?

8. Could the overall framework be applied to other modalities beyond text, such as for auditing vision LLMs? What challenges might arise in adapting this approach?

9. The paper focuses specifically on the probe generation phase. Can you suggest any ways the probe answering phase could be expanded or improved to allow for more rigorous auditing? 

10. What are some of the limitations of relying solely on automated metrics like BERT Score to evaluate probe quality? In what ways can human evaluation provide additional signals that these metrics may miss?
