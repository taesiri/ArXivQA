# [PolicyCleanse: Backdoor Detection and Mitigation in Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03609)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks against reinforcement learning agents in competitive multi-agent environments?

Specifically, the paper focuses on tackling backdoor attacks like BackdooRL which can compromise a reinforcement learning agent by embedding adversary-specified trigger actions. The goal is to develop effective techniques to detect whether a given reinforcement learning agent contains such backdoors and then mitigate the backdoors. 

The main challenges are that in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning, the dynamics between agents and environments are complex. Also the backdoor triggers are sequences of continuous actions with unknown lengths, making it very difficult to reverse engineer like in supervised learning.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new method called PolicyCleanse which is able to identify potential backdoor triggers by optimizing a separate policy using the reversed cumulative rewards of the target agent. It also presents an unlearning-based approach to mitigate detected backdoors.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by leveraging properties of how backdoors impact agent rewards over time, and using specialized policy optimization techniques, it is possible to effectively detect and mitigate backdoor attacks against reinforcement learning agents in complex competitive environments. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes and formulates the problem of backdoor detection in competitive reinforcement learning (CRL). As far as I can tell, this is the first work to study backdoor attacks and defenses in CRL. 

2. It identifies some key properties of backdoor attacks in CRL, such as the smooth degradation of the trojan agent's performance when seeing pseudo trigger actions. These observations motivate the design of the defense method.

3. It proposes PolicyCleanse, a reinforcement learning based method to detect backdoor triggers in CRL agents. The key idea is to learn a separate policy with reversed rewards to identify potential trigger actions.

4. It further proposes an unlearning based approach to mitigate detected backdoors in CRL agents. 

5. It provides comprehensive experiments on different agents and environments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed detection and mitigation methods. The results show PolicyCleanse can reliably detect trojan agents and outperforms existing mitigation baselines.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the new problem of backdoor security in CRL and an effective learning-based solution for detection and mitigation. The results seem quite promising based on the experiments. This looks like an important contribution and a good step forward in securing reinforcement learning systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach called PolicyCleanse to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning environments by identifying pseudo trigger actions that cause the performance of the victim agent to degrade.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on backdoor attacks and defenses in reinforcement learning (RL), which is an emerging research area. Much existing work on backdoor attacks has focused on image classification, so this explores a relatively new problem domain.

- The paper proposes a novel defense method called PolicyCleanse which is designed for RL environments. It is motivated by observing some unique properties of RL backdoor attacks compared to image classification attacks, like performance degrading over multiple timesteps. This shows adapting ideas from image classification defenses is non-trivial.

- Most prior work on defending RL systems has focused on robustness against adversarial examples that perturb the observation space. This paper tackles attacks that operate in the action space by having the attacker agent take malicious actions, a more recent threat model first introduced in BackdooRL.

- For detecting backdoors, the paper leverages ideas like training a separate policy and using reward signals. But it combines those with RL-specific strategies like policy optimization and environment randomization to address challenges unique to RL.

- They design a tailored mitigation approach leveraging the detected pseudo triggers, machine unlearning, and policy optimization. This goes beyond just detection to also provide a way to remove the backdoor, unlike some prior work.

- Experiments are done across multiple game environments and agent types to demonstrate generalization. The comparisons to existing baseline defenses like that from BackdooRL also provide stronger validation.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in a relatively new space applying backdoor detection/defense to RL problems. It adapts concepts from prior work but with novel modifications suited to RL environments and empirically demonstrates the effectiveness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more advanced and adaptive backdoor attack methods against PolicyCleanse. The authors mention that the attacker may develop more sophisticated attacks that can bypass PolicyCleanse while preserving attack efficacy. Defending against such adaptive attacks could be an interesting research direction.

- Applying the backdoor detection approach to other multi-agent competitive scenarios beyond just reinforcement learning games. The authors suggest expanding the scope to applications like autonomous driving, trading systems, etc. 

- Considering other potential issues in multi-agent RL applications like fairness, robustness, efficiency, etc. The authors mention these as important real-world concerns beyond just security.

- Extending the backdoor detection approach to collaborative multi-agent RL scenarios. The current work focuses on competitive games but cooperative multi-agent RL could also be vulnerable to backdoor attacks.

- Reducing the computation costs of the PolicyCleanse method to make it more practical. The authors acknowledge the current overhead and suggest optimizing it.

- Exploring if detecting the exact trigger actions is possible, instead of just pseudo triggers. The authors mention this as an open problem.

- Applying the backdoor detection idea to other domains like computer vision and natural language processing where backdoor attacks also exist. The core principles may extend beyond RL.

In summary, the key suggestions are around developing more adaptive attack/defense methods, expanding the application domains, reducing computation costs, improving trigger localization, and extending the approach to other ML areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new reinforcement learning-based approach called PolicyCleanse for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks against competitive reinforcement learning agents. Backdoor attacks infect a victim agent with a trojan policy that causes it to fail when it observes specific trigger actions from an opponent. PolicyCleanse detects potential trojan triggers by optimizing a separate policy to approximate trojan actions using the victim agent's reversed rewards as feedback. It mitigates detected backdoors through retraining the victim agent on a mix of benign and trojan trajectories. Experiments across games and agent types show PolicyCleanse accurately detects all trojan and benign agents, and improves agent winning rates against trojans by at least 3\% over prior mitigation methods. The approach is shown to be robust to varying trigger lengths, environment randomization, and adaptive attacks. Overall, this is the first paper to study backdoor detection for competitive RL and provides an effective approach leveraging policy optimization and unlearning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a backdoor detection and mitigation approach for competitive reinforcement learning (CRL) systems. CRL involves training two agents to compete in a complex environment. Recent work has shown CRL systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where the attacker embeds trigger actions into a victim agent (Trojan agent) to make it fail during inference. The paper first investigates common properties of Trojan agents and finds their performance noticeably degrades after observing the trigger actions for several timesteps. Leveraging this observation, they propose PolicyCleanse which detects potential triggers by optimizing a separate policy to minimize the Trojan agent's rewards. This yields pseudo triggers that can also activate the Trojan behavior. PolicyCleanse runs the optimization across randomized environments to improve detection. For mitigation, the Trojan agent is retrained on a mix of benign and pseudo trigger actions to purge the Trojan functionality. 

Experiments evaluate PolicyCleanse on different agents and environments under a BackdooRL attack model. It correctly distinguishes all Trojan and benign agents by finding pseudo triggers. The mitigation approach also improves Trojan agents' winning rate against the attacker by at least 3% versus an existing baseline. Further analysis investigates the visual similarity between pseudo and true triggers. Overall, the work provides the first algorithm for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios. The results demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse agents, environments, and attack settings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach called PolicyCleanse for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in competitive reinforcement learning environments. The key idea is to train a separate policy called PolicyCleanse with a reversed reward function given by the target agent being examined. PolicyCleanse goes through two phases - in the first phase it performs actions in front of the target agent that may trigger malicious behaviors. In the second phase, it observes the target agent's cumulative reward over several timesteps to check if the actions in the first phase triggered a degradation in performance, which would indicate the presence of a backdoor. By running PolicyCleanse over multiple randomized environments, it can reliably detect backdoors in the target agent. Once a backdoor is detected, the paper proposes mitigating it via a machine unlearning approach that retrains the agent on a mix of benign and pseudo-trigger trajectories.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key problem this paper is addressing is backdoor attacks in competitive reinforcement learning (CRL) systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on detecting and mitigating malicious backdoors that could be injected into a victim agent (Trojan agent) during training, which would cause the agent to fail or exhibit undesirable behavior when certain trigger actions are taken by an opponent agent. 

The main questions the paper seems to be exploring are:

- How can we detect whether a pre-trained CRL agent contains such a backdoor trigger? This is challenging because the trigger is a sequence of actions rather than a static input, and the dynamics between agents are complex.

- Once a backdoor is detected, how can we mitigate it - i.e. remove the malicious trigger behavior from the victim agent?

- What properties of Trojan agents can we leverage to develop an effective backdoor detection and mitigation approach?

The authors note that prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image classification and regular deep reinforcement learning contexts, but backdoor detection and mitigation in multi-agent CRL systems is a new problem without existing solutions. Hence, the main goal of this paper is to propose and evaluate the first approach tailored to handling backdoors in competitive reinforcement learning agents.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Backdoor attacks - The paper focuses on backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning, where a trigger action sequence can compromise a victim agent.

- Competitive reinforcement learning (CRL) - The paper looks at detecting backdoors in two-player competitive Markov games, a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning.

- Trojan agent - The victim agent that has been compromised by a backdoor attack is referred to as a Trojan agent. It behaves normally unless the trigger action sequence is observed.

- Trigger actions - The specific sequence of actions crafted by the attacker that triggers the Trojan behavior when observed by the victim agent.

- Pseudo triggers - The reversed engineered trigger actions identified by the proposed defense method PolicyCleanse. They may differ from the true triggers but still activate the Trojan agent.

- PolicyCleanse - The proposed defense method to detect Trojan agents and identify pseudo triggers by optimizing a separate policy based on the Trojan agent's reversed reward.

- Mitigation - The proposed technique to mitigate identified backdoors by retraining the Trojan agent on a mix of benign and pseudo trigger episodes. 

- Competitive games - Environments like Run to Goal, You Shall Not Pass, and Sumo used to evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses.

In summary, the key focus is on backdoor attacks and defenses in multi-agent competitive reinforcement learning scenarios using concepts like Trojan agents, trigger actions, PolicyCleanse, and mitigation.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PolicyCleanse, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in competitive reinforcement learning (CRL) environments. The authors first investigate common properties of backdoor attacks in CRL, finding that the performance of a Trojan agent degrades noticeably after observing trigger actions for several timesteps. Leveraging this observation, PolicyCleanse trains a separate policy to identify potential trigger actions by optimizing for the reversed cumulative reward of the target agent. To increase detection success, PolicyCleanse runs this procedure in parallel across randomized environments. Once triggers are identified, an unlearning-based approach is used to mitigate them by retraining the agent on benign and purified data. Extensive experiments demonstrate PolicyCleanse can accurately detect Trojan agents and outperform existing mitigation methods across various agents and competitive environments. Key contributions include proposing the first backdoor defense method for CRL, an effective detection approach using parallel policy optimization, and an unlearning-based mitigation technique. Overall, this paper addresses the critical security issue of backdoor attacks in RL through an innovative defense framework.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes PolicyCleanse, a method for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning agents trained for competitive environments. The key idea is to train a separate "inspector" agent called PolicyCleanse to identify potential trigger actions by interacting with the target agent and optimizing a policy to minimize the target agent's cumulative reward. Once trigger actions are identified, an unlearning procedure is used to retrain the target agent to remove the backdoor. Experiments across different agents and environments show PolicyCleanse can accurately detect backdoored agents and outperforms existing mitigation methods by improving winning rate against the trigger agent by at least 3%. The approach is shown to be robust against various settings like dynamic trigger lengths and adaptive attacks. Overall, this is the first work to address backdoor detection and mitigation in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the reverse of the Trojan agent's cumulative reward as the reward signal for the PolicyCleanse agent. Why is the reverse cumulative reward more effective than directly using the Trojan agent's cumulative reward? Does taking the negative impact the training dynamics or sample efficiency?

2. The PolicyCleanse agent is trained to mimic trigger actions using policy gradients. Could other reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning be effective? What are the trade-offs between policy gradient methods vs value-based methods for this application?

3. The paper finds the Trojan agent's performance degrades even against a random/inactive opponent. Does this indicate the Trojan policy has inherent weaknesses beyond just responding to the trigger? Could the degradation versus a random opponent be used directly to detect Trojans without training PolicyCleanse?

4. The paper uses environment randomization and runs PolicyCleanse on multiple seeds to improve detection. How does randomization help overcome the variance in identifying triggers? Would other methods like domain randomization also be effective? 

5. For mitigation, the paper proposes an unlearning method to replace actions in malicious trajectories. How does this compare to other mitigation strategies like fine-tuning on benign data or retraining from scratch? What are the tradeoffs?

6. How does PolicyCleanse perform against adaptive attacks where the Trojan agent fails more slowly or inconsistently? Can the approach be modified to detect problematic actions even without a clear failure signal?

7. The paper evaluates PolicyCleanse on competitive MuJoCo environments. How would the method need to be adapted for more complex environments like video games? What new challenges emerge in more high-dimensional or partially observable settings?

8. The approach relies on access to the Trojan agent's reward signal. How could it be adapted if the reward is not observable, or if the agent is not cooperative? Could adversarial techniques like generative modeling help?

9. The paper detects backdoors based on degraded cumulative rewards over multiple timesteps. Is there a theoretical basis for this timescale? How could the parameters (N,M) be set automatically for new environments?

10. The threat model assumes the defender has full access to the Trojan agent and environment. How could PolicyCleanse be adapted for more limited access, like only observing the agent's behavior or interactions with a surrogate environment?
