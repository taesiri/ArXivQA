# [PolicyCleanse: Backdoor Detection and Mitigation in Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03609)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks against reinforcement learning agents in competitive multi-agent environments?

Specifically, the paper focuses on tackling backdoor attacks like BackdooRL which can compromise a reinforcement learning agent by embedding adversary-specified trigger actions. The goal is to develop effective techniques to detect whether a given reinforcement learning agent contains such backdoors and then mitigate the backdoors. 

The main challenges are that in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning, the dynamics between agents and environments are complex. Also the backdoor triggers are sequences of continuous actions with unknown lengths, making it very difficult to reverse engineer like in supervised learning.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a new method called PolicyCleanse which is able to identify potential backdoor triggers by optimizing a separate policy using the reversed cumulative rewards of the target agent. It also presents an unlearning-based approach to mitigate detected backdoors.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by leveraging properties of how backdoors impact agent rewards over time, and using specialized policy optimization techniques, it is possible to effectively detect and mitigate backdoor attacks against reinforcement learning agents in complex competitive environments. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes and formulates the problem of backdoor detection in competitive reinforcement learning (CRL). As far as I can tell, this is the first work to study backdoor attacks and defenses in CRL. 

2. It identifies some key properties of backdoor attacks in CRL, such as the smooth degradation of the trojan agent's performance when seeing pseudo trigger actions. These observations motivate the design of the defense method.

3. It proposes PolicyCleanse, a reinforcement learning based method to detect backdoor triggers in CRL agents. The key idea is to learn a separate policy with reversed rewards to identify potential trigger actions.

4. It further proposes an unlearning based approach to mitigate detected backdoors in CRL agents. 

5. It provides comprehensive experiments on different agents and environments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed detection and mitigation methods. The results show PolicyCleanse can reliably detect trojan agents and outperforms existing mitigation baselines.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the new problem of backdoor security in CRL and an effective learning-based solution for detection and mitigation. The results seem quite promising based on the experiments. This looks like an important contribution and a good step forward in securing reinforcement learning systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach called PolicyCleanse to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning environments by identifying pseudo trigger actions that cause the performance of the victim agent to degrade.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on backdoor attacks and defenses in reinforcement learning (RL), which is an emerging research area. Much existing work on backdoor attacks has focused on image classification, so this explores a relatively new problem domain.

- The paper proposes a novel defense method called PolicyCleanse which is designed for RL environments. It is motivated by observing some unique properties of RL backdoor attacks compared to image classification attacks, like performance degrading over multiple timesteps. This shows adapting ideas from image classification defenses is non-trivial.

- Most prior work on defending RL systems has focused on robustness against adversarial examples that perturb the observation space. This paper tackles attacks that operate in the action space by having the attacker agent take malicious actions, a more recent threat model first introduced in BackdooRL.

- For detecting backdoors, the paper leverages ideas like training a separate policy and using reward signals. But it combines those with RL-specific strategies like policy optimization and environment randomization to address challenges unique to RL.

- They design a tailored mitigation approach leveraging the detected pseudo triggers, machine unlearning, and policy optimization. This goes beyond just detection to also provide a way to remove the backdoor, unlike some prior work.

- Experiments are done across multiple game environments and agent types to demonstrate generalization. The comparisons to existing baseline defenses like that from BackdooRL also provide stronger validation.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in a relatively new space applying backdoor detection/defense to RL problems. It adapts concepts from prior work but with novel modifications suited to RL environments and empirically demonstrates the effectiveness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more advanced and adaptive backdoor attack methods against PolicyCleanse. The authors mention that the attacker may develop more sophisticated attacks that can bypass PolicyCleanse while preserving attack efficacy. Defending against such adaptive attacks could be an interesting research direction.

- Applying the backdoor detection approach to other multi-agent competitive scenarios beyond just reinforcement learning games. The authors suggest expanding the scope to applications like autonomous driving, trading systems, etc. 

- Considering other potential issues in multi-agent RL applications like fairness, robustness, efficiency, etc. The authors mention these as important real-world concerns beyond just security.

- Extending the backdoor detection approach to collaborative multi-agent RL scenarios. The current work focuses on competitive games but cooperative multi-agent RL could also be vulnerable to backdoor attacks.

- Reducing the computation costs of the PolicyCleanse method to make it more practical. The authors acknowledge the current overhead and suggest optimizing it.

- Exploring if detecting the exact trigger actions is possible, instead of just pseudo triggers. The authors mention this as an open problem.

- Applying the backdoor detection idea to other domains like computer vision and natural language processing where backdoor attacks also exist. The core principles may extend beyond RL.

In summary, the key suggestions are around developing more adaptive attack/defense methods, expanding the application domains, reducing computation costs, improving trigger localization, and extending the approach to other ML areas.
