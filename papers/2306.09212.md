# [CMMLU: Measuring massive multitask language understanding in Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09212)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate large language models' capabilities for knowledge and reasoning in Chinese?

The authors point out that existing benchmarks like SuperGLUE mainly focus on English and may not be suitable for assessing language models' real-world performance in other languages and cultural contexts. 

They propose creating a new benchmark called CMMLU that:

- Covers a wide range of subjects beyond just core NLP tasks, including STEM, humanities, social sciences, etc.

- Includes knowledge and reasoning skills relevant to Chinese language and culture specifically.

- Uses a standardized multiple choice format to effectively evaluate models' capabilities.

The goal is to use CMMLU to measure the current abilities of advanced multilingual and Chinese-oriented language models for knowledge and reasoning in Chinese. The results will reveal where models still struggle and need improvement.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop a comprehensive benchmark like CMMLU to effectively evaluate large language models' knowledge and reasoning capabilities within the Chinese language context. The authors then use this benchmark to assess the strengths and weaknesses of current models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Introducing CMMLU, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Chinese language models' knowledge and reasoning abilities across diverse subjects. CMMLU covers over 60 topics spanning natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and other important daily life domains.

2. Providing an extensive empirical evaluation of 18 advanced multilingual and Chinese language models on CMMLU. The results reveal significant room for improvement, with most models unable to exceed 50% accuracy even with few-shot examples. 

3. Conducting detailed analysis to identify factors impacting model performance, such as chain-of-thought prompting, number of examples, model scale, question length, negation, and sub-options. The analysis provides insights into current limitations of LLMs and suggests directions to enhance their capabilities.

4. Releasing the full CMMLU dataset and leaderboard to facilitate future research. As the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark of its kind, CMMLU fills an important gap and will enable more rigorous evaluation and development of Chinese LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is creating and open-sourcing CMMLU as a new comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating and analyzing Chinese language models in a multi-task setting across diverse knowledge domains. The empirical findings and analysis also provide valuable insights into current models and how to improve them.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper introduces CMMLU, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on multitask language understanding in Chinese. Other recent works have also proposed Chinese benchmarks, such as MMCU, AGIEval, C-Eval, and M3KE. However, CMMLU covers more subjects (67) across a wider range of areas compared to prior benchmarks. It also includes more China-specific knowledge tests.

- A key contribution of this paper is the extensive evaluation of 18 advanced LLMs on CMMLU. The analysis reveals significant room for improvement, with most models failing to exceed 50% accuracy. Other papers evaluating LLMs on Chinese tasks typically assess fewer models. The evaluation of commercial models like ChatGPT is also novel.

- The paper provides an in-depth analysis of factors impacting model performance on CMMLU. This includes examining performance across subjects, the effects of prompting strategies, model size, question length, etc. The analysis provides insights into model capabilities and directions for improvement. Other related benchmark papers tend to focus less on this type of thorough analysis.

- Compared to evaluations on English benchmarks like SuperGLUE or MMLU, the CMMLU results reveal common struggles of LLMs on certain topics like STEM and China-specific knowledge. They also highlight the capability gap between multilingual and Chinese-specific models. These findings are unique contributions enabled by a Chinese benchmark.

- The public release of the CMMLU dataset, code, and detailed experimental results sets a strong precedent for rigorous and reproducible LLM evaluation research. This level of transparency is not always present in related works.

Overall, this paper pushes forward Chinese LLM evaluation through the scale and scope of CMMLU, extensive model testing, in-depth analysis, and commitment to reproducibility. It tackles an important problem and delivers meaningful insights to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more efficient methods to scale up LLMs while minimizing environmental impact. The paper notes that simply increasing model size does boost performance, but training ever larger models has high computational costs. Methods to improve efficiency, such as utilizing higher-quality training data and refined model architectures, should be explored.

- Enhancing multilingual LLMs' capabilities for different language backgrounds and cultural contexts. The analysis shows weaknesses in handling China-specific knowledge. The authors suggest finding suitable data sources to accommodate diverse users. 

- Improving reasoning and inference skills, particularly for complex question types like those with sub-options or negation. Targeted training approaches to handle such questions could be beneficial.

- Evaluating real-world applicability beyond accuracy metrics. As LLMs generate more fluent responses, solely measuring accuracy may be insufficient. Testing for robustness, safety, and ethics will be important.

- Developing methods to impart commonsense, social awareness, and human values into models. Deficiencies in these areas need to be addressed.

- Expanding multitask evaluation to additional languages beyond English and Chinese. Testing on diverse languages can reveal different strengths and limitations.

In summary, the key directions involve increasing efficiency, cross-cultural competency, reasoning abilities, real-world viability, and social/ethical awareness of large language models. Advancing research in these areas can lead to LLMs that are more capable, inclusive, and aligned with human values and intelligence.
