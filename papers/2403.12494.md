# [Task-Customized Mixture of Adapters for General Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Task-Customized Mixture of Adapters for General Image Fusion":

Problem:
- Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images into a single image. However, different fusion tasks (e.g. multi-modal, multi-exposure, multi-focus) have different fusion mechanisms.
- Existing methods either focus on a single fusion task, resulting in poor generalization, or try to find common fusion mechanisms, failing to accommodate the individual needs of each task. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a unified general image fusion model called "Task-Customized Mixture of Adapters" (TC-MoA).
- Leverage a frozen pre-trained vision model (e.g. ViT) as feature extractor. Insert multiple "Mixtures of Adapters" modules.
- Each module contains task-specific routers and shared adapters. Routers determine routing schemes to customize mixture of adapters for each task. 
- Adapters take features as input and generate "prompts" to select complementary features from multiple sources.
- A mutual information regularization is used to guarantee complementarity of prompts.
- Task-specific loss functions are designed to retain key information for each fusion task.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce mixture of experts concept and efficient adapters into general image fusion.
- Achieve superior performance across multiple fusion tasks with only 2.8% additional parameters.
- Proposed task-customized mixture of adapters and routing enable model to dynamically accommodate diverse fusion tasks.
- Mutual information regularization and task-specific losses ensure retaining key information from sources.  
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance and unprecedented controllability and generalizability to unseen fusion tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel task-customized mixture of adapters architecture that dynamically aggregates complementary information from multiple source images for efficient and unified handling of diverse image fusion tasks within a single model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a unified general image fusion model called task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) that can adaptively handle multiple image fusion tasks (multi-modal, multi-exposure, multi-focus) in a single model. 

2) Developing a mutual information regularization to constrain the adapters, which ensures they retain complementary information from different image sources.

3) Demonstrating that by only adding 2.8% of additional learnable parameters to a pre-trained vision model, the proposed TC-MoA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple image fusion benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

4) Showing the controllability of TC-MoA in manipulating the fused images by scaling and shifting the task-specific prompts, even allowing zero-shot generalization to unseen fusion tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and unified approach to general image fusion that achieves impressive performance while providing flexibility and controllability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- General image fusion - Fusing images from different modalities/exposures/focus levels into a single image. Tasks include multi-modal, multi-exposure, and multi-focus fusion.

- Task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) - The proposed method to accommodate different fusion tasks in a unified model. It uses efficient tuning adapters customized by task-specific routing networks. 

- Mutual information regularization (MIR) - A regularization proposed to guarantee complementarity between features from different sources. 

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning - TC-MoA integrates with a pre-trained vision model in a parameter-efficient way by only tuning a small percentage of parameters.

- Dominant intensity bias - The bias in information contribution between different source images. TC-MoA can perceive and control this bias.

- Prompt controllability - The ability to manipulate the fusion results by tuning the prompts fed into the pre-trained backbone.

- Generalizability - The potential of TC-MoA to generalize to unseen fusion tasks in a zero-shot manner through prompt tuning.

In summary, the key ideas are using a mixture of adapters customized for each task to enable general image fusion in a single model, with controllability via prompt manipulation.
