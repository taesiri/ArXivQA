# [Facebook Report on Privacy of fNIRS data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- fNIRS data collected from AR/VR devices can reveal sensitive private information about users, such as heart rate, attention level, brain disorders, etc. 
- Sharing fNIRS datasets or models trained on such data can enable adversaries to infer this private information through membership inference attacks or model inversion attacks.
- Existing machine learning approaches do not provide adequate privacy protections for fNIRS data.

Proposed Solution:
- Use differential privacy (DP) to train deep neural network models on fNIRS datasets to prevent leakage of private information. DP injects noise into the training process to make model output invariant to any single data point.
- Investigate centralized training with DP optimization algorithms like DP-SGD and DP-Adam. Tune hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, clipping norm to balance privacy and accuracy.
- Explore federated learning, where models are trained on decentralized datasets without sharing data. Enhance privacy through local differential privacy (LDP).

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of impact of hyperparameters on accuracy of models trained with DP. Identified optimal settings for fNIRS dataset.
- Demonstrated tradeoff between privacy (epsilon budget) and model accuracy in private centralized training. Achieved 86% test accuracy at epsilon of 12.
- Established feasibility of federated learning for fNIRS data. Further incorporated LDP into federated learning to prevent membership inference attacks.

In summary, the paper develops private machine learning techniques tailored for sensitive fNIRS data that balance utility and privacy through differential privacy and federated learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops and evaluates differentially private deep learning approaches to train models on fNIRS brain sensing data in both centralized and federated settings while preserving privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The development of deep learning approaches that preserve privacy for training models on fNIRS datasets. Specifically, training models with differential privacy (DP) using differentially private optimization algorithms like DP-SGD and DP-Adam to prevent attackers from inferring private training data.

2) An extensive investigation into how different training parameters like learning rate, batch size, noise multiplier, and clipping norm affect model accuracy when learning with DP. Showing that hyperparameter tuning is critical for optimal results with privacy-preserving learning.

3) Analyzing the trade-off between privacy and utility (accuracy) in private centralized training. Finding that testing accuracy of over 80% can be achieved with a reasonable privacy budget.

4) Examining the effectiveness of federated learning for training shared fNIRS classification models between clients without sharing local data. Showing comparable accuracy to centralized training under IID data.

5) Implementing local differential privacy (LDP) in federated learning to further improve privacy protections and prevent membership inference attacks. Demonstrating the privacy-accuracy trade-offs with different privacy budget values.

In summary, the main contributions are around developing and evaluating privacy-preserving machine learning techniques for fNIRS data, both in centralized and federated learning settings.
