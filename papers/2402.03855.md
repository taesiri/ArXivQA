# [Position Paper: Toward New Frameworks for Studying Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03855)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer neural networks to understand how they implement behaviors and functions. However, most works have only studied simple, token-aligned capabilities on narrow datasets. 
- Real-world capabilities are more complex, so we need to study hidden representations inside models as the unit of analysis, rather than just input-output behaviors.

Representations 
- Activations can be seen as directions in a vector space that encode human-interpretable concepts as a weighted sum of basis vectors.  
- These hidden representations exhibit interesting properties and are crucial for understanding models across tasks like bias, safety, robustness etc.

Limitations of Current Methods
- The authors explore linear representations of dishonesty in a large language model using existing MI techniques. 
- They find these techniques insufficient to answer key questions about why and how representations emerge and how they affect downstream generation over long horizons.

Main Contributions
- Formalize mathematical notation for hidden feature and behavior representations.
- Perform an exploratory mechanistic analysis of dishonesty representations.
- Show that current MI methods fall short in helping understand representations.
- Advocate that new frameworks are needed to study emergence and effects of representations.

Future Directions
- Study how different components interact with representations during training. 
- Explore a disentangled ''representational view'' of models separating features and behaviors.
- Develop information-theoretic and causal formalisms for definitions of features, behaviors and their hierarchies.

The summary covers the key details on the problem definition, proposed approach, experiments, results, contributions and future work from the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper advocates studying hidden feature and behavior representations inside AI models as the right level of abstraction for model understanding, uses dishonesty representations as a case study to showcase limitations of current methods, and posits the need for new frameworks to reason about representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors do a literature review and discuss the importance of studying and formalizing feature and behavior representations as the right unit of analysis for model understanding and control.

2) They perform an exploratory mechanistic analysis of a linear subspace for "honesty" in the Mistral-7B model, showcasing the limitations of current tooling in providing a holistic understanding of representations. 

3) Using their discussion and exploratory results, they justify their position that current MI methods fall short in answering most of the important questions about representations. They advocate for the research community to work toward filling these gaps and coming up with new frameworks to study representations.

In summary, the key contribution is arguing for the need for new frameworks to study hidden representations inside models, using an analysis of honesty representations as an example case study. The authors highlight open questions around how representations emerge, how they affect downstream generation, and the insufficiency of current methods to answer these questions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper advocates for studying representations as the right level of abstraction for model understanding. What are some concrete ways this could enable capabilities like auditing for bias and fairness? How does it compare to other methods like supervised learning on model outputs?

2. The paper explores linear representations for dishonesty. What are some ways non-linear representations could emerge and be studied? For complex behaviors like honesty, do you expect linear representations to capture the full picture?

3. The paper uses principal component analysis on activation differences to find representation directions. What are other possible unsupervised and self-supervised ways to identify directions corresponding to behaviors inside models? 

4. The analysis reveals that representations likely affect dense circuits inside models. What kind of patching methods could help in isolating components in this setting? Are there any fundamental barriers in studying distributed representations via patching?

5. The paper motvates studying both the emergence and effects of representations. What are some ways the training dynamics of language models could be studied to understand the emergence of representations?

6. The analysis shows residual MLPs and attention blocks process representations differently. What are some hypotheses about the role of non-linearities inside MLPs in processing representations? How can we test them?

7. The paper suggests a "representational view" to disentangle models. What are some ways this abstraction can help generalize and transfer findings across models and architectures? What are some challenges in formally defining this abstraction?

8. The analysis reveals several limitations of current MI methods in studying representations. What are some desiderata for new frameworks aimed at representations? What gaps need to be addressed?

9. The paper explores dishonesty representations in detail. What are some other impactful representations that could be studied, such as for bias, toxicity or fairness? How easy or hard would it be to apply the current analysis pipeline on them?

10. The paper suggests using information theory and causality to better define features. What are some ways these could help formally define the notion of features? What challenges do you foresee in using them for hierarchical and causal relationships between features?
