# [A Comprehensive Survey of 3D Dense Captioning: Localizing and Describing   Objects in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Comprehensive Survey of 3D Dense Captioning: Localizing and Describing Objects in 3D Scenes":

Problem:
- 3D dense captioning is an emerging vision-language task that aims to generate multiple natural language descriptions for objects in 3D scenes. It presents challenges due to complex 3D data collection/processing and the lack of diverse/large-scale datasets.  
- Despite recent advancements, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys on 3D dense captioning to guide future research.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper provides the first comprehensive review of 3D dense captioning, covering task definition, model architectures, dataset analysis, evaluation metrics and future outlook.

- It introduces a standard pipeline comprising scene encoder, relation module and feature decoder that serves as a common paradigm. 

- The paper categorizes models based on research focus (relationship modeling, joint modeling, others) and strategy (detection-then-captioning, detection-and-captioning).

- Dataset analysis is provided on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets. Widely used captioning metrics (CIDEr, BLEU, etc.) and detection metrics (mAP) are explained.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive overview of 3D dense captioning landscape, including critical components like methodology review and dataset/metrics analysis.

- Clear taxonomy of existing models based on research focus and strategy. Analysis of differences and connections among techniques.

- Identification of challenges and proposal of promising future directions aligned with developments in related tasks.

In summary, this paper aims to foster a holistic understanding of 3D dense captioning through insightful analysis of past literature and discussion of future outlook. By bridging research gaps, it intends to inspire further investigations and contribute to novel applications in multimedia and related domains.
