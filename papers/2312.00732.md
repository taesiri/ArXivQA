# [Gaussian Grouping: Segment and Edit Anything in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00732)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Gaussian Grouping, a novel method that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable joint 3D scene reconstruction and segmentation of object instances and scene elements. It augments each 3D Gaussian, which represents the scene's geometry and appearance, with a learnable Identity Encoding vector. These identity vectors are optimized to group the Gaussians according to their membership in objects or scene elements. Instead of relying on expensive 3D labels for supervision, 2D segmentation masks from SAM are lifted to 3D in a differentiable manner using a cross-entropy identity classification loss and a regularization loss enforcing encoding similarity of nearby Gaussians. The resulting discrete, grouped Gaussians decompose the scene into editable components, as shown on tasks like object removal, inpainting, colorization, and scene recomposition. Compared to implicit neural radiance fields, this representation reconstructs, segments, and edits 3D scenes with higher quality, finer granularity, and greater efficiency. Experiments demonstrate advantages over prior work in open-world 3D segmentation and editing applications. Key benefits highlighted are versatile downstream editing from the discrete scene decomposition, leveraging powerful 2D segmentation models like SAM to sidestep costly 3D labeling, and preserving the speed and quality of Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.
