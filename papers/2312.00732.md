# [Gaussian Grouping: Segment and Edit Anything in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00732)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Gaussian Grouping, a novel method that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable joint 3D scene reconstruction and segmentation of object instances and scene elements. It augments each 3D Gaussian, which represents the scene's geometry and appearance, with a learnable Identity Encoding vector. These identity vectors are optimized to group the Gaussians according to their membership in objects or scene elements. Instead of relying on expensive 3D labels for supervision, 2D segmentation masks from SAM are lifted to 3D in a differentiable manner using a cross-entropy identity classification loss and a regularization loss enforcing encoding similarity of nearby Gaussians. The resulting discrete, grouped Gaussians decompose the scene into editable components, as shown on tasks like object removal, inpainting, colorization, and scene recomposition. Compared to implicit neural radiance fields, this representation reconstructs, segments, and edits 3D scenes with higher quality, finer granularity, and greater efficiency. Experiments demonstrate advantages over prior work in open-world 3D segmentation and editing applications. Key benefits highlighted are versatile downstream editing from the discrete scene decomposition, leveraging powerful 2D segmentation models like SAM to sidestep costly 3D labeling, and preserving the speed and quality of Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Gaussian Grouping, a method that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to jointly reconstruct and segment anything in open-world 3D scenes by adding Identity Encodings to group Gaussians, enabling downstream editing applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Gaussian Grouping, which extends Gaussian Splatting from pure 3D reconstruction to also support open-world and fine-grained 3D scene understanding. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Introducing an Identity Encoding for each 3D Gaussian to capture the instance or stuff identity in the 3D scene. This allows the Gaussians to be grouped according to their membership.

2) Supervising the Identity Encodings during differentiable Gaussian rendering using automatically generated 2D masks from SAM. This lifts the strong 2D segmentation capability of SAM to 3D space.

3) Proposing an efficient Local Gaussian Editing scheme for versatile downstream scene editing applications like 3D object removal, inpainting, colorization and scene recomposition.

In summary, Gaussian Grouping represents the 3D scene with discrete and grouped Gaussians to achieve joint reconstruction, segmentation and editing of anything in open-world 3D scenes.
