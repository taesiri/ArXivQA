# [Improved Anonymous Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the Anonymous Multi-Agent Path Finding (AMAPF) problem where multiple interchangeable agents operate on a shared graph and need to reach a set of goal locations. The objective is to find an assignment of agents to goals and collision-free paths that minimize the makespan (time when last agent reaches goal). Existing optimal AMAPF solvers reduce the problem to finding maximum flow on a derived flow network. However, the size of this network can be much larger than original graph, making the search very expensive.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an improved optimal AMAPF solver that follows the reduction-based approach but uses a new search algorithm "Bulk Search (BS)" to efficiently find maximum flow on derived network. Key ideas of BS:

1) Implicitly represent and expand bulks/sequences of similar search states instead of expanding states individually. This is done using the concept of "connected sequences" in the network. 

2) Expand only minimum height node in each connected sequence to avoid regenerating higher nodes later.

3) Order search queue based on height to maximize benefits of implicit expansion.

The number of connected sequences is much smaller than number of nodes, leading to huge reduction in expansions.

Contributions:

- Formalization of "connected sequences" and "bulk states" for search on specially structured networks

- Description and proof of completeness of Bulk Search algorithm utilizing these concepts 

- Improved optimal AMAPF solver using Bulk Search that scales significantly better compared to state-of-the-art

- Empirical evaluation showing proposed solver solves all benchmark AMAPF instances in <30 secs while competitor fails on larger instances

Overall the key novelty is the Bulk Search technique for efficient search on specially structured networks, enabling fast optimal solving of AMAPF problems.
