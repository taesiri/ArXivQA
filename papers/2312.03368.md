# [Bottom-Up Instance Segmentation of Catheters for Chest X-Rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03368)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a deep learning based bottom-up approach for segmenting and disentangling individual catheters in chest X-ray images. A branched HRNet architecture is used to simultaneously predict a catheter segmentation mask and an embedding space that groups pixels belonging to the same catheter instance. To handle intersecting catheters, an intersection resolution algorithm is introduced that analyzes the embedding space to identify and assign intersection pixels to multiple instances. Experiments on a dataset of 8,877 chest X-rays containing 11,786 annotated catheters demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average precision and recall of 0.726 and 0.807 respectively. Compared to a connected components baseline, the method effectively addresses challenging cases of intersecting catheters. The work represents the first successful application of deep learning for catheter instance segmentation in chest X-rays. Limitations remain due to coarse ground truth annotations and consistency of predictions across intersections. Overall, the method shows promising results as an automated support tool for non-specialist technicians interpreting X-rays containing cardiac catheters.
