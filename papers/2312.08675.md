# [AVA: Inconspicuous Attribute Variation-based Adversarial Attack   bypassing DeepFake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08675)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new attribute-variation-based adversarial attack (AVA) to bypass DeepFake image detections by subtly perturbing facial attributes that are imperceptible to humans (e.g. mouth openness, hairstyle). AVA inverts a DeepFake image into the GAN latent space and optimizes the embedding towards high-density regions using a Gaussian prior. It then selects candidate attributes to perturb and applies constraints using a learned semantic discriminator to keep changes realistic. Experiments against 9 state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors, including commercial black-box APIs, demonstrate AVA achieving over 95% attack success, outperforming prior attacks. AVA-modified images successfully fooled human evaluators over 50% of the time. The work highlights the need to advance defenses beyond simple artifact detection towards more robust semantic understanding. Key innovations include controlling facial attributes independently and constraining to the natural facial distribution using the semantic discriminator.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Deepfakes are becoming increasingly realistic and widespread, enabling malicious actors to create fake media that is difficult to detect. Most deepfake detection algorithms rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract spatial and frequency domain features from images to detect manipulation artifacts. However, these DNN-based detectors are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small, intentionally worst-case perturbations to images that cause misclassification. Although defenses like adversarial training have been proposed, this paper identifies a new type of attack that perturbs the latent attribute space of images in a way that is imperceptible to humans but still fools detectors.   

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose AVA, an Attribute Variation-based Adversarial attack against deepfake detectors. AVA modifies the semantics of facial attributes like skin color, hairstyle, eyebrow shape etc. in a way that is inconspicuous to humans but removes the artifacts used by detectors. It has two main components:
1) An encoder embeds the image in the GAN latent space. A Gaussian prior then shifts the latent code to a high-density region to prevent abnormal faces after modification.  
2) Candidate attributes are selected and modified via adversarial optimization (white-box) or a genetic algorithm (black-box) to reduce detection score while constraining perturbations to remain realistic using a semantic discriminator.

Contributions:
- Identification of a new class of adversarial attack that perturbs facial attributes rather than pixels to bypass state-of-the-art deepfake defenses including adversarial training.
- A novel technique combining Gaussian prior and semantic discriminator for semantically-constrained latent space optimization.  
- Empirical evaluation showing AVA defeats 9 DNN detectors and 2 commercial systems with 95%+ success rate while being mostly imperceptible to humans.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and impactful attack that exposes vulnerabilities in current deepfake defenses, with an extensive analysis and prototype demonstrating feasibility. The semantics-based approach is an important new direction for further research to advance robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new attribute-variation-based adversarial attack called AVA that can bypass state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors by imperceptibly perturbing facial attributes like mouth openness and hairstyle in DeepFake images to remove the artifacts that detectors use for classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying a new attribute-variation-based adversarial attack (AVA) that perturbs the semantics in the attribute space of DeepFake images to bypass state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors. This may impact billions of users' privacy.

2. Proposing a novel technique that utilizes a Gaussian prior and a semantic discriminator to optimize the DeepFake image inverted in low-density portions of the GAN latent space to high-density portions, and to constrain semantic perturbations within a reasonable attribute space. 

3. Conducting an empirical evaluation that demonstrates AVA can bypass nine state-of-the-art DeepFake detection algorithms with a high success rate, including defeating prominent black box attacks against DeepFake detectors. A human study also shows AVA perturbations are often imperceptible to humans, presenting huge security and privacy concerns.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying and demonstrating a new type of adversarial attack that manipulates facial attributes to bypass current DeepFake detectors while remaining visually imperceptible. This reveals vulnerabilities in existing defenses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- DeepFakes - Synthetically generated or manipulated images/videos of people, especially of their faces, that are designed to be highly realistic and difficult to detect as fake. A core concept that the paper focuses on.

- Adversarial attacks - Carefully crafted inputs that are designed to fool machine learning models, like deepfake detectors. The paper proposes a new type of adversarial attack. 

- Attribute manipulation - Modifying attributes or semantic features of an image, like hair color, facial expressions, etc. The proposed attack works by manipulating attributes to bypass deepfake detectors.

- GAN inversion - Mapping an image back into the latent space of a GAN in order to edit and manipulate it by changing the latent code. Used as part of the proposed attack workflow. 

- Imperceptibility - An important goal of adversarial attacks is that the modifications are imperceptible or very difficult for humans to notice. The attack aims for this.

- Evaluation - Testing the attack against state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, measuring success rates, comparing to other attacks, analyzing impact of different attribute manipulations.

- Defenses - Evaluating performance against common defense techniques like adversarial training and exploring additional mitigation strategies.

In summary, the core focus is on a new type of adversarial attack that manipulates attributes of deepfakes to bypass detection systems, analyzed thoroughly from different perspectives.
