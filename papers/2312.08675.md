# [AVA: Inconspicuous Attribute Variation-based Adversarial Attack   bypassing DeepFake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08675)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new attribute-variation-based adversarial attack (AVA) to bypass DeepFake image detections by subtly perturbing facial attributes that are imperceptible to humans (e.g. mouth openness, hairstyle). AVA inverts a DeepFake image into the GAN latent space and optimizes the embedding towards high-density regions using a Gaussian prior. It then selects candidate attributes to perturb and applies constraints using a learned semantic discriminator to keep changes realistic. Experiments against 9 state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors, including commercial black-box APIs, demonstrate AVA achieving over 95% attack success, outperforming prior attacks. AVA-modified images successfully fooled human evaluators over 50% of the time. The work highlights the need to advance defenses beyond simple artifact detection towards more robust semantic understanding. Key innovations include controlling facial attributes independently and constraining to the natural facial distribution using the semantic discriminator.
