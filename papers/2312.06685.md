# [Causal-CoG: A Causal-Effect Look at Context Generation for Boosting   Multi-modal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-modal language models (MLMs) struggle with providing factual and precise responses for visual question answering (VQA) tasks, often due to issues like shortcuts in the training data.
- Existing works require retraining models to address this, which cannot be easily applied to off-the-shelf MLMs.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes Causal Context Generation (Causal-CoG), a decoding strategy to boost factual capabilities of MLMs for VQA without any training.
- It uses prompting to make the MLM generate contextual descriptions of images, which provide additional information to answer questions. 
- A causality filtering mechanism determines if the generated context is helpful for each sample based on the causal effect.
- For helpful contexts, an aggregation mechanism combines multiple candidate answers using the indirect causal effect as weights.

Key Contributions:
- First work to develop prompting techniques for off-the-shelf MLMs to improve their factual capabilities for VQA without any training.
- Explores the usage of contextual information for VQA through context generation and filtering using concepts from causality literature.
- Show consistent and significant improvements over multiple MLM models on 10 recent VQA datasets, highlighting the applicability of the approach.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel prompting and aggregation strategy called Causal-CoG that can boost factual VQA abilities for MLMs by leveraging contextual information and causal reasoning without requiring retraining. Experiments validate effectiveness and generalization ability across models and datasets.
