# [CAT: Enhancing Multimodal Large Language Model to Answer Questions in   Dynamic Audio-Visual Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have limitations in answering questions in dynamic audio-visual scenarios. Their responses can be ambiguous and fail to describe specific audio-visual events. 

Proposed Solution - CAT Model:
- Enhances MLLM in 3 ways:
   1) Aggregates question-related visual and audio clues to enrich fine-grained knowledge required to answer questions.  
   2) Trained on mixed multimodal datasets including a new collected audio-visual instruction dataset (AVinstruct). Allows direct application in audio-visual scenarios.
   3) Uses an AI-assisted ambiguity-aware direct preference optimization strategy to retrain model to favor non-ambiguous responses.

Main Contributions:
- Propose the CAT model that learns question-related clues and engages directly in dynamic audio-visual inference.
- Collect the AVinstruct dataset - an audio-visual joint instruction dataset to ensure CAT's stability. 
- Propose an AI-assisted ambiguity-aware direct preference optimization strategy to address tendency of MLLMs to give ambiguous responses.
- Evaluation shows CAT outperforms state-of-the-art on variety of audio-visual QA tasks and video-based text generation tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces the CAT model to enhance multimodal language models to better answer questions in dynamic audio-visual scenarios by aggregating relevant clues, using suitable training data, and optimizing to reduce ambiguity. Experiments validate superiority over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces CAT, an enhanced multimodal large language model for audio-visual question answering, which aggregates question-related clues, employs a mixed audio-visual training strategy, and uses ambiguity-aware preference learning to generate more accurate and unambiguous responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a novel audio-visual-language model called CAT that is capable of learning question-related clues and engaging directly in dynamic audio-visual inference. The paper also collects an audio-visual joint instruction dataset called AVinstruct to ensure the stability of CAT in audio-visual question answering tasks.

2. Proposing an AI-assisted ambiguity-aware direct preference optimization (ADPO) strategy to overcome the problem that multimodal large language models tend to ambiguously describe specific audio-visual objects. 

3. Evaluating CAT on a wide range of multimodal tasks and showing its superiority over existing methods. For example, CAT outperforms state-of-the-art on various audio-visual question answering tasks, and achieves remarkable results on video-based text generation tasks and zero-shot video question answering tasks.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing the CAT model, the ADPO strategy, and showing strong experimental results on multiple multimodal tasks. The key ideas are enhancing multimodal language models using question-related clues and reducing ambiguity through preference learning.
