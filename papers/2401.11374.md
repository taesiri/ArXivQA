# [Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current language models (LMs) like BERT and GPT face a key limitation in effectively interpreting and encoding hierarchical structures latent in language. Prior works have shown that pre-trained LMs have limited capabilities in tasks like transitive inference over hierarchies. Although some works have aimed to implicitly incorporate hierarchical signals into LM training, there is a lack of research on explicitly encoding hierarchies in LMs.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a novel method to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer Encoders (HiTs). The key idea is to situate the output embedding space of LMs within a Poincaré ball and apply tailored hyperbolic losses named clustering loss and centripetal loss during re-training. These losses enforce embeddings of related entities to cluster together in the Poincaré ball, and organize entities hierarchically with parents positioned closer to the ball's origin. 

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a general and effective strategy to re-train transformer encoder LMs as hierarchy encoders without changing model architectures or adding extra parameters.

- Proposal of hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses tailored for hierarchy re-training of LMs.

- Extensive experiments showing HiT models outperform both pre-trained and fine-tuned LMs in tasks like multi-hop inference, mixed-hop prediction and transfer learning across hierarchies.

- Analysis of HiT embeddings indicating their capability in hierarchy-oriented semantic search.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions towards enabling LMs to capture and leverage hierarchical structures for enhanced language understanding. The proposed HiT approach shows promise in a wide range of hierarchical reasoning tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based language models as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs) by situating their output embedding space within a Poincaré ball and optimizing on tailored hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses, in order to enable explicit encoding and interpretation of hierarchies latent in language.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based language models (LMs) as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs). Specifically, the paper introduces hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses tailored for LM re-training to enable explicit encoding of hierarchies by clustering and hierarchically organizing related entities. The resulting HiT models demonstrate proficiency in simulating transitive inference and predicting subsumptions within and across hierarchies, outperforming both pre-trained and fine-tuned LMs.

The paper introduces a novel approach called Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs) to retrain language models to explicitly encode hierarchies. It utilizes hyperbolic geometry and defines losses like hyperbolic clustering loss and hyperbolic centripetal loss for the retraining process. The models are evaluated on tasks like multi-hop inference, mixed-hop prediction, and transfer learning across hierarchies. The models outperform pretrained and fine-tuned language models on these tasks. The hierarchies used for evaluation include WordNet, SNOMED CT, Schema.org, FoodOn, and Disease Ontology.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel hierarchy re-training approach for transformer encoder-based language models. Could you explain in more detail the intuition behind using hyperbolic geometry and the specific hyperbolic losses that are employed? 

2. The hyperbolic clustering loss aims to cluster related entities while distancing unrelated ones. How does the use of triplets and the margin parameter $\alpha$ achieve this objective? Could you walk through an example?

3. The hyperbolic centripetal loss pushes child entities further from the origin than their parent entities. What is the intuition behind introducing an "imaginary root entity" at the origin? How does the margin parameter $\beta$ enforce this hierarchy?

4. The paper re-trains several sentence transformer models like MiniLM and MPNet. What modifications, if any, were made to the model architectures besides adding a mean pooling layer? Why exclude any normalisation layers after pooling?

5. For constructing the Poincaré ball manifold, the paper uses a curvature value $c=\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the embedding dimension. What is the rationale behind this choice? Did you experiment with other curvature values? 

6. The scoring function for predicting subsumptions incorporates both the clustering and centripetal heuristics. Explain the role of the weighting parameter λ. How was its value determined?

7. The multi-hop inference task evaluates transitive reasoning while the mixed-hop prediction task examines generalization to unseen subsumptions. Compare and contrast these two tasks. Which one is more challenging for the re-trained models?

8. When analyzing the hyperbolic norms of entity embeddings, you observed a sharp decline at higher norms. What could be the plausible reasons? Does this provide any insight into hyperparameter configuration?

9. For the transfer tasks, why evaluate on ontologies like Schema.org and Disease Ontology that seem very different from WordNet? What new challenges emerge in the transfer setting compared to the base tasks? 

10. The re-trained models outperform both static Poincaré embeddings and fine-tuned language models. What are the key advantages of your proposed approach over these two baselines? What limitations still exist?
