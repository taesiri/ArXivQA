# [PMGDA: A Preference-based Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09492)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In many multi-objective machine learning applications, it is desirable to find a Pareto optimal solution that matches a given preference specified by the user/decision maker. However, existing multi-objective optimization algorithms struggle to effectively handle user preferences, especially for large-scale problems like training deep neural networks. 

Key ideas:
This paper proposes a novel "predict-and-correct" framework called PMGDA to find Pareto optimal solutions matching user preferences. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a preference function $h(\theta)$ that measures how well a solution $\theta$ matches the user preference. $h(\theta)=0$ indicates perfect match.

2) Iteratively do "prediction" to reduce objectives without hurting $h(\theta)$, and "correction" to reduce $h(\theta)$ without increasing objectives too much. This drives $h(\theta)\rightarrow 0$.

3) Efficiently solve the prediction and correction subproblems by converting them to smaller linear programs with only $O(m)$ variables where $m$ is the number of objectives (much smaller than number of parameters $n$).

Contributions:

1) First method to effectively find exact Pareto solutions matching a wide range of preference functions, including previously unsupported cases like region-of-interest constraints.

2) Prediction and correction framework makes it suitable for large-scale deep network training.

3) Shows superior performance over prior arts like EPO, COSMOS, mTche on synthetic and real-world MTL and MORL problems. Converges faster and finds more precise solutions.

4) Flexible framework can likely be extended to incorporate other types of preferences.

Limitations:
As a gradient-based method, PMGDA cannot guarantee global optimality. Future hybridization with evolutionary methods may help address local optima.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel predict-and-correct framework called Preference-based Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (PMGDA) for efficiently finding Pareto optimal solutions that satisfy user-specified preference functions in large-scale multi-objective optimization problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel framework for identifying Pareto solutions that align with a wide range of general preference functions, where finding exact Pareto solutions is a special case. The proposed method can also effectively find Pareto optimal solutions that meet specific region of interest (ROI) requirements, which is rarely addressed in previous gradient-based multi-objective optimization methods.

2. It develops efficient algorithms for both the prediction and correction steps of the proposed framework, making it suitable for tackling large-scale multi-objective deep neural network training problems. 

3. It rigorously tests the proposed method (PMGDA) on well-known synthetic challenges, deep multi-task learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning problems. PMGDA demonstrates superior performance in terms of solution precision and computational efficiency for finding exact Pareto optimal solutions, while it is the first approach to successfully find Pareto solutions satisfying the ROI constraint.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a flexible and efficient framework called PMGDA for finding Pareto solutions matching user-specified preference functions, with applications in deep neural network training.
