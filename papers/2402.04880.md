# [Combining Cloud and Mobile Computing for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models are rapidly increasing in size, making them difficult to run on resource-constrained mobile devices due to limitations like memory capacity and battery life. 
- However, mobile device performance is also improving over time. There is a need for flexible workload distribution between mobile devices and the cloud.

Proposed Solution:
- Use model segmentation to divide computation between mobile devices and the cloud. Offload the compute-heavy portion of models to the cloud while minimizing data transfer.
- Design a scheduler that collects information on network quality, client device capability and job requirements. Make dynamic decisions on task assignment to achieve consistent performance across devices while reducing cloud workload.

Key Contributions:
- Show model segmentation can reduce user wait times while allowing cloud workload to be optimized.
- Find that while some models like RegNet run fast enough on mobile devices, generative models like Stable Diffusion still benefit greatly from cloud offloading.
- Propose a scheduling algorithm that determines cloud offload amount based on device capability to meet latency targets. Allows batching to further improve efficiency.
- Demonstrate up to 60% decrease in cloud GPU demand compared to fully cloud-based approach, with consistent user experience across device types.
- Show approach responds well to improvements in mobile hardware performance and future model size increases.

In summary, the paper presents a solution for collaborative machine learning inference between mobile devices and the cloud. The scheduling approach aims to balance user latency and quality of experience with cloud provider costs. Evaluations demonstrate flexibility and efficiency gains from the proposed techniques.
