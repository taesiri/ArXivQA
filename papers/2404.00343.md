# [Commonsense Scene Graph-based Target Localization for Object Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Efficiently locating target objects is critical for household robots to perform downstream tasks like object search and manipulation. However, the placement of movable objects by users in dynamic home environments makes accurate target localization challenging. Existing methods rely solely on either object-level knowledge or room-level spatial layouts, lacking a comprehensive understanding to reason about target locations. This leads to poor localization and inefficient object search.

Method: 
The authors propose a Commonsense Scene Graph-based Target Localization (CSG-TL) to enhance target search by integrating both object-level and room-level knowledge. This is achieved by constructing a Commonsense Scene Graph (CSG) from a pre-built map of stationary items, infusing object-level commonsense knowledge about items and their relationships derived from a large language model (LLM). Modeling targets as nodes in the CSG allows exploiting rich correlations for target localization. 

Building on CSG-TL, a full framework called CSG-based Object Search (CSG-OS) is presented. It first predicts potential target locations using CSG-TL, projects these onto the map, and plans optimal search points balancing likelihood and navigation cost. During search, detecting new objects updates the CSG, continuously refining localization and plans.

Contributions:
1) Propose CSG-TL to fuse room and object-level knowledge via a CSG for superior target localization.
2) Develop a CSG-OS framework incorporating CSG-TL for efficient object search, achieving state-of-the-art performance in simulations and real-world deployment.

The method is evaluated extensively on ScanNet and AI2THOR environments, significantly outperforming previous approaches on target localization and object search. CSG-OS is also validated on a real Jackal robot searching household objects, proving its practical applicability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a commonsense scene graph-based target localization and object search method that integrates spatial layout and object relationship knowledge from pre-built maps and large language models to efficiently locate target objects for household robots.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing CSG-TL, a novel method that merges knowledge at both the room-level from pre-built maps and object-level commonsense obtained from a large language model (LLM) into a commonsense scene graph (CSG). This facilitates superior target localization.

2. Building on CSG-TL, proposing a commonsense scene graph-based object search (CSG-OS) framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulation studies and successful deployment on a real robot.

In summary, the key innovation is using the commonsense scene graph (CSG) to integrate spatial knowledge from pre-built maps with commonsense insights from LLMs to significantly enhance a robot's ability to locate target objects for more efficient search. This is validated through both the CSG-TL model for accurate target localization and the full CSG-OS pipeline for complete object search tasks.
