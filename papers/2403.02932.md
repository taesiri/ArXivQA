# [RulePrompt: Weakly Supervised Text Classification with Prompting PLMs   and Self-Iterative Logical Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC) aims to classify texts into predefined categories using only limited supervision like label names, instead of labeled data. 
- Recently, prompting pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown promising results for WSTC. However, relying solely on seed words like label names is not enough for precisely characterizing category meanings.
- Existing methods use either manual verbalizers or automatically discovered indicative words, but fail to differentiate their varying effects and capture their correlations.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose logical rules to represent categories, using indicative words as atomic propositions connected via conjunction and disjunction. This can capture both independent and synergistic effects of words.
- Develop a novel PLM-based approach RulePrompt with two key modules:
   - Rule mining module extracts frequent indicative words and word pairs from texts grouped by categories to construct the logical rules.
   - Rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module incorporates the mined rules into three PLM-based models to produce pseudo labels from different perspectives.
- Establish a closed loop where inaccurate pseudo labels and imprecise rules iteratively enhance each other, with label names as starting point. Also fine-tune PLM in a self-supervised manner.

Main Contributions:
- First work to differentiate effects of indicative words for categories in WSTC through logical rules to represent them more precisely. 
- Novel approach leveraging PLMs to iteratively update both pseudo labels and logical rules to sufficiently fuse rule-based knowledge and unlabeled data.
- Experiments show superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Logical rules provide interpretability to avoid confusion between categories.

In summary, the paper proposes using logical rules to represent category meanings and establishes an iterative process to acquire and utilize these rules for weakly supervised text classification, achieving effectiveness, robustness and interpretability.
