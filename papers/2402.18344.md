# [Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems   in Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper identifies a problem called "Toxic Chain of Thought (CoT)" where large language models can originally predict the correct answer to a question, but after applying CoT-style reasoning methods, the model's answer becomes wrong. This happens in around 30-40% of CoT errors.
- The paper categorizes this into two types of issues that happen in the rationale generation stage and answer generation stage of CoT reasoning: "Rationale Drift" where the rationale is inconsistent with the question, and "Answer Drift" where the final answer is inconsistent with the correct rationale.

Interpretation: 
- The paper hypothesizes these issues arise from the model lacking information from the original question when generating the rationale or final answer. 
- Using attribution tracing and causal tracing methods, the paper probes the model's internal workings and finds significant information flow differences from the question context between correct and erroneous CoT cases.
- The results validate the hypotheses that lack of information retention from the question causes the Toxic CoT problem in both the rationale and answer stages.

Solution - RIDERS Method:
- As an optimization method, the paper proposes RIDERS which stands for Residual Decoding and Serial Position Swap. 
- The Residual Decoding algorithm compensates for information loss when generating rationales by incorporating additional attention scores from the question context.  
- The Serial Position Swap changes the position of the question and rationale in the input sequence to mitigate answer drift issues.

Contributions:
- Identifies and interprets the Toxic CoT problem which is a crucial bottleneck affecting 30-40% of CoT errors.
- Probes the inner mechanisms behind this problem through attribution and causal tracing experiments.
- Proposes an effective RIDERS method to address Toxic CoT issues and improve overall CoT reasoning performance. Experiments validate the approach, showing a 23.6% decrease in Toxic CoT problems and 5.5% increase in accuracy.
