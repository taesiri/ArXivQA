# [Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems   in Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper identifies a problem called "Toxic Chain of Thought (CoT)" where large language models can originally predict the correct answer to a question, but after applying CoT-style reasoning methods, the model's answer becomes wrong. This happens in around 30-40% of CoT errors.
- The paper categorizes this into two types of issues that happen in the rationale generation stage and answer generation stage of CoT reasoning: "Rationale Drift" where the rationale is inconsistent with the question, and "Answer Drift" where the final answer is inconsistent with the correct rationale.

Interpretation: 
- The paper hypothesizes these issues arise from the model lacking information from the original question when generating the rationale or final answer. 
- Using attribution tracing and causal tracing methods, the paper probes the model's internal workings and finds significant information flow differences from the question context between correct and erroneous CoT cases.
- The results validate the hypotheses that lack of information retention from the question causes the Toxic CoT problem in both the rationale and answer stages.

Solution - RIDERS Method:
- As an optimization method, the paper proposes RIDERS which stands for Residual Decoding and Serial Position Swap. 
- The Residual Decoding algorithm compensates for information loss when generating rationales by incorporating additional attention scores from the question context.  
- The Serial Position Swap changes the position of the question and rationale in the input sequence to mitigate answer drift issues.

Contributions:
- Identifies and interprets the Toxic CoT problem which is a crucial bottleneck affecting 30-40% of CoT errors.
- Probes the inner mechanisms behind this problem through attribution and causal tracing experiments.
- Proposes an effective RIDERS method to address Toxic CoT issues and improve overall CoT reasoning performance. Experiments validate the approach, showing a 23.6% decrease in Toxic CoT problems and 5.5% increase in accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies and analyzes the Toxic Chain of Thought problem in language models, where additional reasoning paths from Chain of Thought methods cause originally correct answers to become wrong, and proposes the RIDERS method to address this issue by compensating for information loss from questions during rationale and answer generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It identifies a crucial bottleneck affecting large language models' reasoning performance called the Toxic CoT problem. It probes this issue through attribution tracing and causal tracing methods, and interprets the mechanism behind it as the model missing information from questions in shallow attention layers. The results contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the LLM's reasoning mechanisms.

2. To mitigate the Toxic CoT problem, it introduces RIDERS, which effectively compensates for the internal information loss during CoT reasoning from decoding and serial-position perspectives. 

3. It conducts extensive experiments on various benchmarks. The results not only verify the rationality of the interpretation, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in addressing the Toxic CoT problem (decreased by 23.6%) and enhancing commonsense reasoning performance (increased by 5.5%).

In summary, the main contributions are identifying and interpreting the Toxic CoT problem, proposing an effective mitigation method called RIDERS, and validating its effectiveness through experiments. The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning mechanisms and help improve their commonsense reasoning abilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Toxic Chain-of-Thought (Toxic CoT): The issue where chain-of-thought style reasoning techniques cause models to deviate from originally correct answers, defined by the authors.

- Rationale Drift: A type of Toxic CoT issue where the reasoning chain is factually correct but logically inconsistent with the question. 

- Answer Drift: Another type of Toxic CoT issue where the reasoning chain is consistent but the final answer is inconsistent.

- Attribution tracing: A method used to probe models' internal workings by computing neurons' contributions. 

- Causal tracing: Another probing method that quantifies intermediate variables' contributions by intervening on them.

- Residual Decoding (RD): One of the proposed methods to address Rationale Drift issues by promoting attention to question contexts.  

- Serial Position Swap (SPS): The other proposed method to address Answer Drift issues by changing output positions.

- RIDERS: The overall approach combining RD and SPS to mitigate Toxic CoT problems from both decoding and serial position perspectives.

Other key terms include commonsense reasoning, chain-of-thought, prompting methods, information flow, attention layers, decoding strategies, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the Residual Decoding (RD) algorithm to address the Rationale Drift issue. How exactly does computing the additional attention score and incorporating it as a reward encourage the model to pay more attention to question contexts when generating the chain of thought?

2. The Serial Position Swap (SPS) method is proposed to mitigate the Answer Drift issue. The authors argue it reduces the total information loss from the question and chain of thought to the final prediction. Can you mathematically formulate information loss in the model and prove how SPS reduces it? 

3. The interpretation of the Toxic CoT problem is that the model lacks information from the question context in shallow attention layers. Has an experiment been done to trace the information flow from the question in deeper layers to investigate if this interpretation still holds?

4. Have ablation studies been conducted to analyze the effect of different components in the RD algorithm, such as the number of candidate tokens, the attention layer selected for computing scores, etc? 

5. The paper conducts experiments on 5 commonsense reasoning datasets. Why were these specific datasets selected? Could the method be evaluated on additional more complex datasets like math word problems?

6. The Toxic Rate metric quantifies the severity of Toxic CoT problems. Are there any other metrics that could be proposed to evaluate the performance of methods in mitigating these issues?

7. What is the theoretical time and space complexity of the Residual Decoding algorithm? How do the complexities compare to standard decoding methods like greedy search and beam search?

8. The method in the paper is evaluated on 13B parameter models. Could the approach be applied to larger models without modifications or would adjustments be necessary?

9. The paper focuses on compensating for information loss from the question context. Could similar techniques be developed to reduce information loss from other input components like the options? 

10. How does the performance of RIDERS compare if only the RD component or only the SPS component is used? What is the synergy effect of combining the two techniques?
