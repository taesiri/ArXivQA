# [Retrieval meets Long Context Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions it aims to address are:

1) Retrieval-augmentation versus long context window - which method is better for downstream tasks that require reasoning over long contexts? 

2) Can retrieval-augmentation and long context extension be combined to get the best of both worlds?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Retrieval-augmentation can compensate for a short context window and allow small models to perform comparably to much larger models with longer contexts.

- Retrieval is still helpful even for large models with very long context windows, and combining retrieval with long context can yield further improvements.

Specifically, the paper compares retrieval-augmented 4k context models against 16k context models without retrieval, hypothesizing the former can match the performance of the latter. It also explores augmenting the 16k and 32k context models with retrieval, hypothesizing this gives further gains. The paper aims to provide insights on whether practitioners should focus on extending context length versus adding retrieval to existing models.

In summary, the central questions revolve around directly comparing retrieval-augmentation against increasing context length, and exploring if both techniques can be combined beneficially, for state-of-the-art large language models on downstream tasks requiring reasoning over long contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing new math notation for efficiently representing common mathematical objects like random variables, vectors, matrices, etc. in a consistent and readable way. 

Specifically, the paper proposes:

- Special notation for random variables, random vectors, random matrices, and their elements (e.g. \rvx for a random vector, \ervx for an element of that vector). This provides a unified and clear way to distinguish between deterministic and random quantities.

- Notation for common math objects like vectors (\vx), matrices (\mA), tensors (\tA), graphs (\gA), and sets (\sA). 

- Notation for entries or elements of these objects (e.g. \emA for an entry of matrix \mA).

- Commands for common math functions and distributions like the softmax, Laplace distribution, etc.

- Commands for referring to sections, figures, equations, etc. (e.g. \secref{sec:intro}).

- Incorporation of bold math fonts for distinction.

Overall, by introducing this consistent notation system, the paper aims to improve the readability and writability of mathematical and scientific documents that involve random variables, probabilistic modeling, and linear algebra objects. The notation is designed to be intuitive yet unambiguous. Adoption of this notation could make papers in these areas more accessible.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on studying the tradeoffs between retrieval augmentation and extending the context window for large language models (LLMs). Other recent works have looked at these techniques separately, but there is limited work systematically comparing them. 

- The paper evaluates very large LLMs, like the 70B parameter LLaMA model. Most prior work has studied smaller models in the 1B to 10B parameter range. Evaluating at such a large scale provides insight into how these techniques interact for the most capable LLMs.

- The paper shows that retrieval augmentation boosts performance even for very long context models like 32K LLaMA. Some other concurrent work found retrieval did not help large context models, likely due to evaluating smaller models. This paper demonstrates the benefits of retrieval hold even as context length grows.

- The paper introduces a strong retrieval augmented model, outperforming commercial systems like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Davinci-003 on several long context datasets. Prior work has not evaluated such capable retrieval augmented models.

- The paper systematically compares different context lengths, retrieval techniques, and amount of retrieved context. This provides a comprehensive picture of how to combine retrieval and long context for LLMs.

Overall, this paper significantly advances understanding of augmenting large LLMs with retrieval, demonstrating substantial gains in capability not shown in prior work. The scale of models evaluated, strength of the resulting system, and thoroughness of evaluation compares very favorably to related research in this emerging area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more efficient attention mechanisms and architectures to handle even longer input sequences. The paper discusses various approaches like sparse attention, low-rank projection attention, similarity-based attention, etc. But handling sequences longer than 65,536 tokens still remains challenging.

- Exploring different ways to extend context length during pretraining and finetuning. The paper experiments with positional interpolation but mentions other methods like using relative position embeddings. More work can be done on figuring out optimal strategies.

- Studying the interplay between retrieval and long context models more deeply. The paper shows retrieval helps both short and long context models, but more analysis is needed on reasons behind "lost in the middle" phenomena.

- Experimenting with different retriever architectures and training methods. The paper uses dual-encoder retrievers but future work could explore end-to-end learned retriever-LLM models.

- Evaluating on broader sets of long-context tasks like dialogue, coreference resolution etc. This paper focuses on QA and summarization but other domains need to be assessed too.

- Testing the limits of how long the context can be extended to while still improving performance. At what point do diminishing returns kick in for context length?

- Comparing different decoding strategies like greedy vs sampling with long context models. How significant is the impact of decoding method along with context length?

- Exploring multimodal inputs like combining text with images, videos etc. Multimodality may help reduce dependence on long text context alone.

In summary, the paper provides a solid analysis of long context vs retrieval augmented models, while pointing towards several interesting directions for future work to build upon.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a method to extend the context length of large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA 2 and GPT-43B beyond their original pretrained context lengths of 4K tokens. They use positional interpolation to expand the context lengths to 16K and 32K tokens. The authors then evaluate both the baseline pretrained models and the expanded context models on several long-context question answering and summarization tasks. They find that retrieval augmentation significantly improves performance for both short 4K context and long 16K/32K context models. Interestingly, retrieval-augmented 4K context models can match the performance of non-retrieval 16K context models, while being more efficient. Further, retrieval continues to boost performance even for the expanded 16K and 32K context models. Their best retrieval-augmented LLaMA-32k model outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo and Davinci003 on average across the long context tasks. Overall, the paper demonstrates the benefits of combining retrieval with increased context lengths, and shows that both techniques can improve performance on downstream tasks requiring reasoning over long contexts. The results highlight that retrieval remains useful even as context lengths grow, and combining retrieval with very long context LLM yields strong performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method for extending the context length of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and LLaMA. The key idea is to perform "positional interpolation" to adapt the positional embeddings to handle longer context. Specifically, the authors take an LLM pretrained with a context length of 4,096 tokens, and finetune it on a large text corpus using a context length of 16,384 tokens. During finetuning, the positional embeddings for the new token positions between 4,096 and 16,384 are interpolated between the original learned embeddings. This allows the model to smoothly extend its effective context length to 4x longer than originally pretrained.

The authors demonstrate strong results by evaluating LLMs with context lengths of 4k, 16k, and 32k on a variety of QA and summarization datasets. The extended 16k and 32k models outperform the base 4k models in most cases, showing the benefit of the larger context. Interestingly, they also find that applying retrieval with a separate retriever at inference time improves results for both the base 4k models and extended 16k/32k models. Their best retrieval-augmented 32k LLaMA model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to GPT-3.5 and Davinci-003 on the studied tasks. The work provides useful insights on techniques to improve LLMs using both longer context and retrieval.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes extending the context length of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and LLaMA using retrieval augmentation during inference. The authors first pretrain a dense retriever using passages from Wikipedia to encode passages into embeddings. At inference time, the question is encoded into an embedding using the retriever and compared via dot product to the passage embeddings to retrieve the top relevant passages. These passages are concatenated together and fed into the LLM along with the question. This allows the LLM access to much more relevant context beyond its pretrained context length. The authors experiment with different context lengths for the LLMs from 4K to 32K tokens and find that retrieval augmentation consistently improves performance across all context lengths on a variety of QA datasets. The best performance is achieved by combining retrieval with the longest 32K context LLM. Overall, the paper demonstrates the benefit of retrieval augmentation for improving long context reasoning, even for very large LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is comparing two approaches for language models to handle long context: using retrieval to find relevant context, and extending the model's built-in context window. The key questions it is addressing are:

1) For downstream tasks requiring reasoning over long context, which performs better: retrieval-augmentation or increasing the language model's context window length? 

2) Can retrieval and long context window methods be combined to achieve even better performance?

3) How do different retriever systems impact the overall performance when used with large language models?

4) How does increasing the amount of retrieved context (top 5 vs top 10 chunks) affect performance?

The paper performs experiments using two large language models (a proprietary 43B parameter GPT and LLaMA2-70B) on a range of question answering and summarization tasks requiring reasoning over long documents. It finds that retrieval significantly improves performance for both short context and long context models, and that combining retrieval with the longest context window tested (32K tokens) achieves state-of-the-art results on these long context tasks. The paper also analyzes different retriever systems and amount of retrieved context. Overall, it provides insights into the strengths of both retrieval augmentation and context window extension for handling long documents.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new attentive mixture of experts (AME) layer that dynamically routes different parts of the input to different experts. How does the routing mechanism in the AME layer work? What are the key differences compared to traditional mixture of experts architectures?

2. The paper shows that the AME layer helps improve performance on a variety of NLP tasks. What properties of the AME routing mechanism enable it to be effective across different tasks? How does it help the model adapt to different linguistic phenomena?

3. The AME layer requires computing attention over the experts for each example. Does this significantly increase the computational overhead compared to traditional mixture of experts? Are there ways to reduce this cost?

4. The gating network is crucial for routing different parts of the input to appropriate experts. The paper uses a simple 1-layer MLP for this routing. Could using a more sophisticated gating network like a Transformer help improve routing?

5. The paper evaluates different numbers of experts in the AME layer. What are the trade-offs in using fewer versus more experts? Is there a point of diminishing returns as the number of experts increases?

6. How sensitive is the performance of AME to the capacity of the individual experts? Would overparameterized experts hurt routing to the most appropriate expert for each part of the input?

7. The paper focuses on NLP tasks. What modifications might be needed to apply AME to other modalities like images or speech? Could AME be useful for multimodal tasks?

8. The paper studies AME in the context of classification. How might AME change for generation tasks like translation or summarization? Are discrete routing decisions still appropriate in those settings?

9. AME requires simultaneously computing attention over all experts. For models with very large numbers of experts, could approximate nearest neighbor attention be used to reduce this cost? How might that impact overall performance?

10. The paper studies AME for single layers. How would stacking multiple AME layers impact modeling capabilities and training efficiency? Are there benefits to using different routing mechanisms in different layers?
