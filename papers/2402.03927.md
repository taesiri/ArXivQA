# [Leak, Cheat, Repeat: Data Contamination and Evaluation Malpractices in   Closed-Source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03927)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There is growing concern over data contamination in proprietary large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, where details on training data are not disclosed. This raises credibility issues when these models are evaluated in research.

- Prior work has focused on detecting contamination through memorization cues but overlooks "indirect data leaking", where benchmarks leak into LLMs from user interactions after deployment. 

Methodology
- The authors systematically analyze 255 papers using ChatGPT and estimate data leakage to it in terms of samples from 263 benchmarks. 

- They classify leakage as low (<5% samples leaked), moderate (5-95%) or high (>95%).

Key Findings
- 42% papers leaked data to ChatGPT models, totaling ~4.7 million benchmark samples. 

- High leakage was seen for 53% datasets, moderate for 4%, low for 25%. Tasks like NLI, QA and NLG had most high leakage benchmarks.

- Several concerning evaluation practices were observed - unfair comparisons, lack of baselines, incomplete details affecting reproducibility.

Contributions
- First quantification of indirect data leakage issue in LLMs based on literature review. 

- List of 263 benchmarks leaked to guide further investigations into data contamination.

- Best practices proposed for evaluating proprietary LLMs.

- Public collaborative repository with leakage details to allow contributions from other researchers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically analyzes 255 papers evaluating ChatGPT, finds that 42% leaked about 4.7 million benchmark samples to the model, documents evaluation malpractices like unfair comparisons and reproducibility issues, and proposes best practices for evaluating closed-source language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors systematically analyze 255 papers evaluating OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. They carefully detail the amount of data leakage from these papers, estimating that around 4.7 million samples from 263 datasets could have been leaked to the models.

2. They document a number of emerging evaluation malpractices in the reviewed papers, including unfair or missing baseline comparisons, lack of code/data access, and avoidable data leakage. 

3. They propose a list of suggested best practices for researchers evaluating closed-source LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, such as avoiding web access, interpreting performance cautiously, using open models when possible, ensuring fair comparisons, and reporting details to improve reproducibility.

4. They release their survey results as a collaborative project on a website, detailing the datasets and level of leakage. This can help the research community better understand data contamination issues with these models. The website allows others to contribute known leaks.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic analysis quantifying the data contamination issue in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, along with documenting evaluation issues and suggesting best practices going forward. The public collaborative website is also a valuable contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Indirect data leakage - The paper introduces this concept to refer to data from benchmarks being leaked to proprietary models like ChatGPT through user interactions and evaluations. This can enable further model improvements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the paper quantify and categorize different levels of data leakage severity (low, moderate-low, moderate-high, high)? What thresholds are used to determine these categories?

2. What are some limitations of existing approaches for detecting data contamination that this paper identifies? How does the concept of "indirect data leaking" address some of these limitations?

3. What specific criteria does the paper use to determine if a paper provides data to ChatGPT in a way that could be used for further model training? For example, how is the data usage policy applied?

4. What are some challenges in accurately quantifying data leakage, especially when it comes to determining if separate leaks should be summed or treated as overlapping? How does this paper handle these challenges? 

5. How does the paper investigate the time distribution of papers leaking data to better understand when most leakage occurred? What trends does this analysis reveal?

6. What evidence suggests that data leaked by users may be more impactful for model improvement compared to plain web scraped text? How might this data be used by model vendors?

7. How does the paper categorize tasks in terms of data leakage severity? Which tasks have suffered from the most and least severe leaks overall?

8. What factors make the leaked custom datasets particularly problematic? Why is leaking labels for few-shot prompting considered an especially severe form of data leakage?

9. How comprehensive is the list of leaked datasets provided in this paper? What difficulties are there in compiling a fully exhaustive list?

10. How was the collaborative repository created by this paper designed to allow other researchers to contribute to data leakage quantification efforts? What benefits could this transparency provide?
