# [RH20T-P: A Primitive-Level Robotic Dataset Towards Composable   Generalization Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19622)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current robotic systems lack the ability to generalize to novel tasks and environments beyond their training distribution. Recent methods utilizing large language models (LLMs) as high-level planners show promise through "composable generalization agents" (CGAs) that break down tasks into primitive skills. 
- However, CGAs face challenges due to lack of a robotic dataset with fine-grained primitive skill annotations and over-reliance on proprietary LLMs like GPT-4V. This hinders transparency, flexibility, and precise motion planning.

Proposed Solution:
- A new primitive-level robotic dataset called RH20T-P built on the RH20T dataset with approx. 33,000 video clips covering 44 tasks. Clips are manually annotated with meticulous primitive skills based on robot arm motions and gripper state changes.
- Propose a CGA called RA-P built on RH20T-P, with two specialized planners - a task planner using LLaVA for decomposition into predefined primitive skills, and a motion planner using Deformable DETR to provide spatial information for motions.

Main Contributions:
- RH20T-P dataset with careful primitive skill design and diverse/rich spatial information to enable more advanced CGAs.
- RA-P agent demonstrating effectiveness of RH20T-P - adapts to novel physical skills through composable generalization using the dataset's primitive skills and motion trends.
- Results show RA-P outperforms imitation baselines and proprietary CGA methods on unseen tasks, especially benefiting from precise motion planning.

The paper makes key contributions in addressing challenges for composable generalization agents via a new robotic dataset and demonstration of an agent leveraging this dataset to handle novel tasks/skills. The proposed solutions help overcome hurdles related to transparency, flexibility, and motion planning compared to prior arts.
