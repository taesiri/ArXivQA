# [Partially-Observable Sequential Change-Point Detection for   Autocorrelated Data via Upper Confidence Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00220)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of sequential change point detection for multivariate autocorrelated data streams under partial observability. Specifically, due to limited sensing resources, only a subset of the multivariate data stream can be observed at each time point. This raises challenges in change point detection and localization due to information loss. The paper considers the problem of how to efficiently detect changes in the data stream based on adaptive sampling of a subset of variables over time.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a detection scheme called Adaptive Upper Confidence Region with State Space Model (AUCRSS). The key aspects are:

1) Models the multivariate data stream using a State Space Model (SSM) to capture correlations and autocorrelations. A partially observable Kalman filter is developed for online inference.

2) Constructs a change point detection scheme based on Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) using the prediction errors from Kalman filter. Analyzes how detection power relates to sampling strategy.

3) Formulates the problem as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) with detection power as reward. Proposes an adaptive sampling strategy based on Upper Confidence Bound to balance exploration and exploitation. 

4) Provides an Empirical AUCRSS algorithm to reduce computational complexity.

5) Theoretically analyzes the detection delay and proves that the adaptive sampling strategy can converge to optimal dimensions over time.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel formulation of multivariate autocorrelated data stream monitoring under partial observability using SSM and Kalman filter.

2) Connecting sampling strategy to detection power leveraging GLRT framework and CMAB formulation.

3) Adaptive sampling algorithm for balanced exploration and exploitation exploiting correlations.

4) Theoretical analysis of detection delay convergence.

5) Demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real data.

The paper makes key contributions in bridging the gaps between adaptive sampling, change point detection and autocorrelated data modeling for tackling a critical problem in streaming data monitoring.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called AUCRSS for partially-observable multivariate data stream change point detection, which models the data streams via a state space model, uses a combinatorial multi-armed bandit formulation to adaptively select the best subset of variables to observe, and applies an upper confidence bound strategy to balance exploration and exploitation for efficient change point detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the problem of partially-observable multi-sensor sequential change point detection for autocorrelated data streams:

1. It proposes a novel method called AUCRSS (Adaptive Upper Confidence Region with State Space model) which models the multivariate time series data using a state space model and develops a partially-observable Kalman filter algorithm for inference. 

2. It constructs a change point detection scheme based on the generalized likelihood ratio test using the one-step ahead prediction error and analyzes how the detection power relates to the adaptive sampling strategy.

3. It formulates the problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) with the detection power as the reward function and proposes an adaptive sampling policy based on the upper confidence bound to balance exploration and exploitation.

4. It provides theoretical analysis on the asymptotic average detection delay and proves some key properties of AUCRSS in terms of preferred sampling under in-control and out-of-control conditions.

5. It demonstrates the effectiveness of AUCRSS over several state-of-the-art methods through extensive numerical studies on synthetic data and a real-world case study of a milling process.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel framework AUCRSS for partially-observable multi-sensor sequential change point detection that carefully models autocorrelated multivariate data streams and develops an adaptive sampling strategy to improve detection power. Both theoretical and empirical results validate its advantages.

The paper proposes a new method called "adaptive upper confidence region with state space model (AUCRSS)" for partially-observable multivariate data stream change point detection, where the data exhibits autocorrelations. It uses a state space model along with a partially-observable Kalman filter for modeling and inference. For change point detection, a generalized likelihood ratio test method is developed. An adaptive sampling strategy based on upper confidence region is proposed to balance exploitation and exploration, with connections formulated to the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem. Theoretical analysis and numerical studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AUCRSS method.

7. Explain the difference between AUCRSS and E-AUCRSS. What approximation does E-AUCRSS make and why? How does it impact performance and complexity?

8. The adaptive α formulation uses a segment-wise linear function of the test statistic. Explore other possible formulations for α and their impact on performance.

9. How do the theoretical results characterize the behavior of the algorithm in in-control and out-of-control states? What do they imply about convergence over time?

10. The method models autocorrelation but assumes independence across variables conditional on the hidden state. Discuss extensions to model complex cross-variable dependencies and their potential benefits.
