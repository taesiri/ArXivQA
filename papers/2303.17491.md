# [Language Models can Solve Computer Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17491)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: 

Can a pre-trained large language model (LLM) agent successfully execute computer tasks guided solely by natural language instructions using a simple prompting scheme?

Specifically, the authors propose an approach called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) prompting, where the LLM recursively criticizes and improves its own outputs to ground them appropriately for the task. The key hypothesis is that by applying RCI prompting to sequentially improve task, state, and agent grounding, an LLM agent can effectively take actions on computers in a sample efficient manner without needing extensive fine-tuning or demonstrations.

The authors test this on the MiniWoB++ benchmark of web-based computer tasks. Their results show the RCI prompting approach significantly outperforms prior LLM methods and also surpasses supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques, using only a couple demonstrations per task.

Additionally, the paper explores if RCI prompting can enhance LLM reasoning abilities on a suite of language reasoning tasks, where it also proves effective. 

In summary, the central hypothesis is that recursive self-critiquing and improvement of outputs allows LLMs to execute computer tasks from natural language instructions in a simple yet powerful manner. The experimental results lend strong support to this hypothesis.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, I would summarize it in one sentence as: This paper proposes an approach using recursive criticism and improvement (RCI) prompting to enable large language model (LLM) agents to execute computer tasks guided by natural language instructions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models for computer control tasks:

Overall Approach:

- This paper proposes an approach called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) prompting to enable LLMs to execute computer tasks via natural language instructions. RCI works by having the LLM recursively critique and improve its generated actions. 

- Other recent work has focused more on selecting actions from a constrained set of options or integrating LLMs with additional models rather than having the LLM generate fully open-ended actions. For example, some methods ground actions by comparing to a predefined list of admissible actions or multiplying action probabilities with learned value functions.

- The RCI approach stands out in its aim to have the LLM autonomously ground its actions via critiquing and iterative improvement, without relying on extra trained components. This provides more flexibility to scale to diverse tasks.

Performance:

- This paper shows strong results on the MiniWoB++ benchmark, outperforming prior supervised learning, RL, and LLM methods. With RCI, their approach achieves state-of-the-art among methods using only demonstrations and no environmental rewards.

- However, RCI underperforms compared to state-of-the-art approaches that combine supervised learning from demonstrations and RL with handcrafted rewards. This highlights current limits in relying solely on an LLM's capabilities.

Sample Efficiency:

- A key advantage demonstrated is the high sample efficiency of RCI prompting. It requires only a couple demonstrations per task rather than tens of thousands like some prior work.

- This enables applicability to new tasks with very limited human data, making it more practical.

Reasoning Ability:

- Beyond computer tasks, the paper shows RCI prompting also improves LLM performance on reasoning benchmarks, outperforming zero-shot prompting and chain of thought prompting.

- This helps demonstrate the broader potential of RCI as a technique for enhancing LLM reasoning.

In summary, the RCI prompting approach sets itself apart by completely relying on LLMs to ground actions, while showing competitive performance on MiniWoB++ and improved reasoning ability. The high sample efficiency is a notable strength. But results also reveal current limits compared to methods that incorporate demonstrations and rewards.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Investigating novel prompt engineering techniques to enable more seamless integration of grounding updates, in order to improve overall plan correction capabilities for long-horizon decision making. The initial plan generated by the model may contain errors, so developing methods for plan correction during task execution could improve performance.

2. Exploring natural language as a universal interface for decision-making policies. Converting task-specific actions and states into a natural language input/output could allow for the development of more generalizable decision-making models. Integrating natural language input/output signatures into large language models is noted as an interesting avenue to create universal decision-making models.

3. Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The authors note current LLMs still have limitations in complex reasoning tasks such as thinking multiple steps ahead. Improving the reasoning proficiencies of LLMs will be crucial for accomplishing more cognitively demanding computer tasks.

4. Leveraging large multimodal foundation models. The paper suggests future multimodal models that incorporate text, images, audio and video could overcome challenges related to processing real-world websites and visual task components that the current HTML-based agent struggles with.

5. Fine-tuning language models on computer tasks. The authors note fine-tuning could increase model performance on these tasks compared to the pre-trained models used in the paper.

6. Combining the RCI prompting approach with other methods like reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Integrating RCI with more traditional RL/IL algorithms is noted as a promising direction, for example by learning to generate prompts/critiques.

In summary, the main future directions are improving reasoning and planning capabilities, developing more generalizable multimodal policies, and combining LLMs with other learning methods like RL and IL. Advancing LLMs to increase task grounding on computer tasks is the core focus.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for using large language models (LLMs) to execute computer tasks guided by natural language instructions. The key technique is Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) prompting, where the LLM recursively critiques and improves its own outputs to generate grounded actions. RCI is applied in three stages for computer tasks. First, an action plan is generated and improved via explicit RCI. Then, implicit RCI refines actions to be feasible in the current state. Lastly, implicit RCI ensures actions are executable by the agent. Experiments on the MiniWoB++ benchmark show the RCI approach surpasses existing supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance using only a handful of demonstrations per task and no reward function. Additionally, RCI prompting is shown to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities on a suite of language reasoning tasks, demonstrating its broad utility. Overall, the work presents a promising method for adapting LLMs to interactive decision-making problems using recursive self-critiquing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) prompting to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on computer tasks and reasoning benchmarks. RCI works by having the LLM recursively critique and improve its own outputs. For computer tasks, RCI is used to sequentially improve task grounding, state grounding, and agent grounding of actions generated by the LLM. Explicit RCI is used to improve task grounding by critiquing and improving a generated plan. Implicit RCI is then used to refine the task-grounded actions to be feasible in the current state (state grounding) and executable by the agent (agent grounding). 

The proposed RCI prompting method is evaluated on the MiniWoB++ benchmark of computer tasks and a suite of reasoning datasets. Results show it significantly outperforms prior LLM methods on MiniWoB++, reaching state-of-the-art performance with very few demonstrations per task. RCI also improves LLMs on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks over zero-shot prompting and prior prompting methods like chain-of-thought. Overall, the work demonstrates RCI prompting as an effective technique for adapting LLMs to interactive tasks and enhancing their reasoning abilities. The method provides a promising direction for utilizing LLMs in real-world decision-making problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) prompting as a technique to enhance the reasoning and grounding capabilities of large language models (LLMs). RCI prompting works by first generating an initial output through zero-shot prompting of the LLM. Then the LLM is prompted to critique its own output and identify any errors or problems. After critiquing the output, the LLM is prompted again to generate an improved output that addresses the issues identified in the critique. This recursive process of critiquing and improving can be repeated, with each iteration aiming to enhance the output. For computer tasks, RCI prompting is used to sequentially improve the task, state, and agent grounding of actions generated by the LLM. By leveraging the self-critiquing ability of LLMs, RCI prompting provides a simple yet effective technique to boost performance across a range of reasoning tasks and improve the applicability of LLMs to interactive computer control.
