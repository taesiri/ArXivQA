# [Do LLMs Implicitly Determine the Suitable Text Difficulty for Users?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: Personalized and adaptive education requires systems to dynamically adjust the difficulty level of content to match an individual student's comprehension level. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for educational applications, it is important to analyze their capability to implicitly modulate text difficulty between user inputs and generated responses without relying on explicit difficulty annotations. 

Proposed Solution: The authors conduct experiments on two datasets - a new Stack Overflow question-answering dataset and the existing Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus (TSCC) dialogue dataset. They analyze how well various LLMs are able to correlate the text difficulty levels between user inputs and model-generated responses using metrics like FLESCH, SMOG, FKGL, NERF and length. Additionally, relevance (BERTScore) and conciseness are evaluated. The models analyzed include different sizes of LLaMA-2, CodeLLaMA, Mistral based models and compare with human performance as well as GPT models.

Key Findings:
- LLMs can correlate difficulty levels between inputs and outputs reasonably well, sometimes even surpassing humans on certain metrics, indicating potential for personalized education applications.  
- Instruction tuning methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback are shown to be more impactful than simply scaling up model sizes for better difficulty handling ability.
- While performance on the Stack Overflow dataset was decent, dialogue scenarios on TSCC proved to be more challenging for implicit difficulty modulation.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of a new Stack Overflow conversational QA dataset for analyzing text difficulty correlation.
- Systematic benchmarking of various open-source LLMs on their zero-shot difficulty handling capability based on multiple metrics. 
- Demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to dynamically adjust text difficulty without explicit inputs, which can inform future work on adaptive educational systems.

In summary, this paper provides useful insights into benchmarking LLMs for unconditional text difficulty modulation, while also identifying areas for improvement via tailored instruction tuning. The findings open up possibilities for personalized and adaptive learning using LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how large language models can implicitly adjust the text difficulty between user input and generated response without explicitly specifying the user's comprehension level, finding that models like LLaMA-2-chat and GPT-4 demonstrate this capability while underscoring the importance of instruction tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is exploring how large language models (LLMs) can implicitly adjust text difficulty between user input and generated text without requiring explicit instruction or tuning on text difficulty. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Creates a new Stack Overflow dataset for question answering-based conversations to evaluate LLMs' ability to handle text difficulty
- Evaluates various LLMs on the Stack Overflow dataset and existing TSCC dataset through metrics like text difficulty correlation, synonymity, and text redundancy
- Finds that models like LLaMA-2-chat and GPT-3.5/4 can achieve high correlation in text difficulty between input and generated text, sometimes surpassing human performance
- Shows the importance of instruction tuning for improving LLMs' implicit text difficulty handling ability
- Discusses limitations around the datasets and evaluation methods used

The key insight is that with the right training approaches, LLMs have the potential to automatically modulate text difficulty to match users' comprehension levels without needing explicit signals - a crucial capability for education/learning applications. Analyzing this implicit difficulty handling process can inform future research into personalized and adaptive AI.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How exactly does the paper evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to implicitly determine suitable text difficulty for users? What metrics and datasets are used?

2. What prompts are used for the LLMs when generating text responses, and why is it important that these prompts do not explicitly indicate a target text difficulty level?

3. The paper finds that instruction tuning of LLMs leads to better performance in handling text difficulty. What specifically does instruction tuning of LLMs involve and why does it help with this task?  

4. What are the key differences in results between the Stack Overflow and TSCC datasets? What might explain why most LLMs struggle more with the TSCC conversations?

5. The paper observes that sometimes LLMs surpass human performance in handling text difficulty. What might enable the LLMs to do better than humans in certain cases? Are there also cases where humans still do markedly better?

6. How exactly is text redundancy evaluated in determining whether LLMs produce responses of appropriate length? What are the limitations of only comparing response length relative to input length?  

7. What might the skipping of rows by CodeLLaMa models indicate about limitations in their instruction tuning? Why do other instruction tuned models not have this issue?

8. Could the strong performance by GPT models be influenced by possible overlap between the Stack Overflow dataset and their training data? How could this be evaluated further?

9. What directions for future work related to evaluating or improving LLMs' text difficulty handling ability are suggested? Which seem most promising or impactful? 

10. How could the proposed evaluation approach be adapted to languages other than English? What key challenges would need to be addressed?
