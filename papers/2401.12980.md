# [Identifying Risk Patterns in Brazilian Police Reports Preceding   Femicides: A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Based Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12980)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Femicide, the murder of women due to their gender, is a major issue, especially in the context of domestic violence. Research shows there is typically a pattern of escalating violence by the perpetrator before such murders. If authorities could assess the risk level to victims, preventative steps could be taken. Machine learning offers a way to analyze past police reports to identify risk patterns. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network good for sequence data, to analyze domestic violence police reports preceding femicide cases. They take two approaches: 1) Classify reports as "higher risk" or "lower risk" based on if the femicide occurred within a year. 2) Predict next likely abusive action in sequential reports from the same perpetrator.

Data: 
162 Brazilian police reports from 2017-2021 related to 39 femicide victims, including incidents both long before and close in time to the murders.

Methods:
1) Classified reports as high/lower risk using LSTM. Achieved 66% accuracy in predicting risks.
2) Manually extracted features of abuse from reports to create sequences of actions. Used LSTM to predict next action, like going from threats to violence. 

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates LSTM can assess danger levels and patterns in domestic violence reports.
- Provides a machine learning approach to complement human risk assessment. 
- Method 2 gives specific insights into potential escalation of violence.
- Highlights importance of detailed police reports to enable analysis.
- Discusses real-world challenges: underestimation of abuse, limited resources.
- Overall, explores a way to leverage data to understand and prevent femicide based on early warning signs.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the LSTM-based solution proposed, the data and methods used, accuracy achieved, how this approach contributes to femicide risk assessment, real-world applications and challenges, and the overall goal of preventing future murders by understanding early abuse patterns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to analyze police reports on domestic violence cases in Brazil culminating in femicide, with the aim of assessing risk levels to prevent further violence against women.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing and demonstrating two LSTM-based approaches for assessing the risk levels associated with escalating domestic violence against women, using real police reports data, with the ultimate goal of preventing potential femicide incidents. 

Specifically, the two key contributions are:

1) Classifying police reports into higher risk and lower risk categories using LSTM, with 66% accuracy. This allows prioritizing cases where urgent action may be needed to protect victims.

2) Employing LSTM to predict the next anticipated action in a sequence of abusive behaviors extracted from police reports. This provides insights into the potential harm or danger the victim may face if no preventive measures are taken.

In summary, the paper introduces and tests the applicability of LSTM and natural language processing to supplement human subjective analysis in assessing the risk levels depicted in domestic violence cases, with the aim of preventing further harm to the victims. The promising results demonstrate these techniques' usefulness in this context.

The paper focuses on using LSTM and NLP techniques to analyze police reports related to domestic violence cases that culminated in femicide. The goal is to identify risk patterns and sequential behaviors that could help assess the danger faced by victims. Keywords like "femicide", "domestic violence", "risk assessment", "machine learning", "LSTM", and "NLP" capture the main themes and approaches of the research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that some reports provided just simple broad overviews while others contained more detailed narratives. In what ways could the varying level of detail in the reports impact the accuracy of the models? What steps could be taken to mitigate this?

2. The threshold for determining high vs low risk categories was set at 1 year preceding the femicide. However, the paper mentions that medium risk may be a more suitable term for the >1 year category. What considerations should go into setting an appropriate threshold here? 

3. The feature extraction process for the sequence prediction model was done manually. What are some ways this process could be automated to allow analysis on a much larger dataset? What NLP techniques could help extract both explicit keywords and implicit semantics from the reports?

4. The paper identified some broad categories like "physical aggression" that needed to be broken down into more specific features like "punches" for the model to better understand the nuances. What methods could be used during data exploration and preprocessing to systematically identify such cases and expand the feature space?  

5. Since the data sample size was relatively small, what techniques like cross-validation could help reliably evaluate model performance during training? How could additional external datasets be leveraged to pre-train the models before fine-tuning on this domain-specific data?

6. The paper mentions the possibility of human bias in underestimating the severity of domestic violence situations. In what ways could the models also inadvertently introduce bias into the risk assessments? How could this be evaluated and addressed?

7. For real-world usage, what additional steps would need to be taken to deploy and monitor these models responsibly if they are assisting with decisions regarding victims' safety?

8. The sequential prediction approach yields the next expected action based on the sequence history. However, how could the model provide insights into the estimated timeframe or probability of that predicted outcome? 

9. What mechanisms could be introduced to allow police officers to provide feedback to iteratively improve the model over time as more reports data becomes available?

10. Besides LSTM, what are some other sequence modeling techniques that could viably analyze the sequential behavior patterns in the data? How could an ensemble of different approaches potentially improve performance?
