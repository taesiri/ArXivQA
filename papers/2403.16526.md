## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Deformable image registration is crucial in medical imaging to fuse information from different modalities. Traditional iterative methods are slow while deep learning methods accelerate solutions but face challenges in usability and precision. The goal is to balance accuracy, efficiency and generalizability in registration.

Method:
This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated Motion Decomposition Transformer (ModeTv2) for deformable registration. Key aspects are:

1) Pyramid network structure for coarse-to-fine optimization. Handles global deformation at low resolution and local deformation at high resolution.

2) Motion Decomposition Transformer (ModeT) explicitly computes deformation field from feature correlations using multi-head neighborhood attention. Decomposes motion patterns at low resolution. 

3) CUDA implementation of ModeT attention for efficiency. Reduces memory usage and speeds up computation.

4) Registration Head (RegHead) refines and integrates subfields from ModeT using a convolutional layer. Increases deformation realism and reduces parameters.

5) Optional diffeomorphic layer for topology preservation.

Contributions:

- CUDA accelerated ModeT improves efficiency for pairwise optimization and enhances usability.

- RegHead effectively fuses motion subfields, improving accuracy and reducing parameters.

- Extensive experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Adopting pairwise optimization balances accuracy, efficiency and generalizability.

The method provides an interpretable deep learning model for deformable registration with strong inductive bias. The pyramid network and ModeT module enable faster convergence. RegHead and CUDA operators improve accuracy and efficiency. Overall, the method advances deep learning based image registration.
