# [OSRT: Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution with Distortion-aware   Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop an effective super-resolution method for omnidirectional images (ODIs) that properly accounts for the unique geometric distortions present in these images?

The key points related to this question seem to be:

- Previous ODI super-resolution (ODISR) methods do not properly account for the distortion effects when downsampling ODIs from the original fisheye projection to the equirectangular projection (ERP). This results in unrealistic training data.

- The authors propose a new downsampling method called "Fisheye downsampling" that applies downsampling directly on the original fisheye images to better mimic real world effects.

- They design a "Distortion-aware Transformer" (OSRT) that continuously modulates the distortions in ERP images using deformable attention and convolution blocks. This allows the model to adapt to distortions in a self-supervised manner.

- They augment the limited ODI training data by generating pseudo ERP images from regular 2D images. This helps address overfitting to the small training set.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that accounting for fisheye distortion effects and using a distortion-aware model architecture will improve ODISR performance compared to prior methods. The key contribution is the proposed Fisheye downsampling method and OSRT model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a more realistic downsampling process called Fisheye downsampling that better mimics the real-world imaging process for omnidirectional images (ODIs). This is in contrast to prior work that uses equirectangular projection (ERP) downsampling. 

2. Designing a distortion-aware Transformer model called OSRT that can continuously and self-adaptively modulate the distortions in ERP images using deformable mechanisms. Specifically, OSRT uses a distortion-aware attention block and distortion-aware convolution block.

3. Introducing a convenient data augmentation strategy to synthesize pseudo ERP images from plain images. This helps reduce overfitting of large networks on limited ODI datasets.

In summary, the key innovations are in formulating a more appropriate downsampling process, designing a distortion-aware Transformer to handle ODI distortions, and leveraging plain images for data augmentation. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed OSRT model. The main advantage is in effectively handling distortions in ODIs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called OSRT that uses a distortion-aware Transformer to super-resolve equirectangular omnidirectional images, outperforming previous methods by modeling the image distortion and augmenting the limited training data with synthesized equirectangular patches from regular images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in omnidirectional image super-resolution:

- It proposes a new downsampling approach called "Fisheye downsampling" that better mimics the real-world imaging process and generates more realistic low-resolution ERP image pairs for training. This is a novel contribution compared to prior works like LAU-Net and SphereSR that use standard bicubic downsampling on ERP images. 

- It designs a new architecture called OSRT (Omnidirectional image Super-Resolution Transformer) that incorporates geometric properties of ERP images in a "distortion-aware" manner. It uses deformable mechanisms to continuously modulate distortion, which is different from prior works that treat distortion as additional input or use latitude-specific modules.

- It shows superior quantitative results to prior state-of-the-art methods like LAU-Net and SphereSR. With the proposed Fisheye downsampling and OSRT, it achieves over 0.2dB PSNR gain.

- It proposes a data augmentation strategy to generate pseudo ERP images from perspective images. This helps overcome overfitting issues for large networks like OSRT. The data augmentation provides a 6x increase in training patches.

In summary, this paper pushes ODISR performance through contributions in problem formulation, model architecture, and data augmentation. The proposed techniques help the model better handle distortions in ERP images. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art ODISR performance. The key novelty is the distortion-aware modeling rather than treating distortion as external information.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced and robust fisheye downsampling methods to better mimic real-world imaging processes for omnidirectional images. The authors' proposed fisheye downsampling approach is a good start but has limitations. More work could be done to model real-world fisheye camera optics and sensor characteristics.

- Exploring other model architectures and self-attention mechanisms for omnidirectional image super-resolution. The authors propose a distortion-aware Transformer model, but there is room to experiment with other architectures like deformable convolutional networks. The self-attention could also be improved.

- Using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and improving perceptual quality. The authors focus on PSNR and SSIM metrics. But GAN training could help improve perceptual quality.

- Expanding and diversifying training datasets for omnidirectional images. The lack of training data was a major challenge. Developing better procedural generation or data augmentation techniques could help. Collecting more real-world training data could also be beneficial.

- Studying the sampling of equirectangular projections for display/viewing. The authors focus on the super-resolution reconstruction but properly sampling the equirectangular projection for display is also important for quality.

- Applying the techniques to video omnidirectional images. The current work looks at individual still images. Extending this to video super-resolution could be impactful.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more realistic data generation techniques, exploring novel model architectures, improving perceptual quality, expanding datasets, and extending the work to video and sampling for display. Overall, there are many opportunities to build upon this paper's foundations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes OSRT, a new method for super-resolving omnidirectional images stored in equirectangular projection (ERP). It introduces Fisheye downsampling, which better mimics the real-world imaging process and generates more realistic low-resolution ERP training pairs. The method designs a distortion-aware Transformer (OSRT) that modulates ERP distortions continuously using feature-level warping based on latitude offsets.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes OSRT, an Omnidirectional image Super-Resolution Transformer for super-resolving equirectangular projection images. Previous methods for omnidirectional image super-resolution use uniform downsampling on equirectangular images, which omits the geometric properties and results in unrealistic low resolution images. The authors propose using fisheye downsampling instead, which better preserves the pixel density distribution of the original fisheye images. To modulate the distortions in equirectangular images, the authors design a distortion-aware Transformer (OSRT) which incorporates the geometric properties in a distortion-aware manner. Specifically, OSRT uses feature-level warping to continuously modulate the distortions based on latitude. OSRT introduces two dedicated blocks - a distortion-aware attention block and a distortion-aware convolution block - which can directly replace standard blocks in Transformers and ConvNets to perform distortion modulation. Without requiring complex processing, OSRT outperforms previous methods by about 0.2dB in PSNR. The authors also propose a data augmentation method to generate pseudo equirectangular images from plain images to reduce overfitting. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed OSRT method.

In summary, this paper makes three main contributions - proposing a more realistic fisheye downsampling process, designing a distortion-aware Transformer to modulate equirectangular image distortions, and introducing a data augmentation method using plain images to boost performance. The proposed OSRT method achieves state-of-the-art results for omnidirectional image super-resolution by properly incorporating geometric properties into the model.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a distortion-aware Transformer called OSRT for omnidirectional image super-resolution. Omnidirectional images stored in equirectangular projection (ERP) format suffer from distortion due to stretching, especially near the poles. The paper first proposes a more realistic downsampling method called Fisheye downsampling which applies downsampling on the original fisheye images before converting to ERP format. This preserves the true pixel density distribution. Then the OSRT architecture modulates the ERP distortion in a continuous and self-adaptive manner without complex processing. It uses two dedicated blocks - distortion-aware attention block (DAAB) and distortion-aware convolution block (DACB) which perform feature-level warping using offsets predicted from the latitude. These blocks can directly replace standard self-attention and convolution blocks respectively to handle distortion. OSRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. The paper also proposes a data augmentation method to generate pseudo-ERP images from plain images to reduce overfitting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem of low resolution in omnidirectional images (ODIs), which are also known as 360° or panoramic images. 

- ODIs require very high resolution to capture details across the entire scene, but most ODIs today have insufficient resolution. 

- Previous methods have tried to solve this via super-resolution on equirectangular projection (ERP) images, but they don't properly account for the geometric properties of ERP in the degradation process. So their models don't generalize well to real ERP images.

- This paper proposes two main contributions:

1) A new "Fisheye downsampling" method that better mimics the real-world imaging process and creates more realistic low-resolution ERP image pairs for training.

2) A distortion-aware Transformer model (OSRT) that can continuously and adaptively modulate the distortions in ERP images during super-resolution, using ideas like deformable convolutions.

- OSRT outperforms previous methods by ~0.2dB in PSNR. The paper also proposes a data augmentation method using perspective projections to reduce overfitting.

In summary, the key question is how to do super-resolution for omnidirectional/panoramic images in a way that properly accounts for their geometric distortions, and the paper proposes a new downsampling model and Transformer-based method to address this.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for super-resolution of omnidirectional images (ODISR). Previous ODISR methods apply bicubic downsampling on equirectangular images (ERPs) to generate training pairs, but this process harms the intrinsic pixel density distribution of original fisheye images. To address this, the authors propose Fisheye downsampling, which applies downsampling on fisheye images before converting to ERP.
