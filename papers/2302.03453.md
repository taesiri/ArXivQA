# [OSRT: Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution with Distortion-aware   Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop an effective super-resolution method for omnidirectional images (ODIs) that properly accounts for the unique geometric distortions present in these images?

The key points related to this question seem to be:

- Previous ODI super-resolution (ODISR) methods do not properly account for the distortion effects when downsampling ODIs from the original fisheye projection to the equirectangular projection (ERP). This results in unrealistic training data.

- The authors propose a new downsampling method called "Fisheye downsampling" that applies downsampling directly on the original fisheye images to better mimic real world effects.

- They design a "Distortion-aware Transformer" (OSRT) that continuously modulates the distortions in ERP images using deformable attention and convolution blocks. This allows the model to adapt to distortions in a self-supervised manner.

- They augment the limited ODI training data by generating pseudo ERP images from regular 2D images. This helps address overfitting to the small training set.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that accounting for fisheye distortion effects and using a distortion-aware model architecture will improve ODISR performance compared to prior methods. The key contribution is the proposed Fisheye downsampling method and OSRT model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a more realistic downsampling process called Fisheye downsampling that better mimics the real-world imaging process for omnidirectional images (ODIs). This is in contrast to prior work that uses equirectangular projection (ERP) downsampling. 

2. Designing a distortion-aware Transformer model called OSRT that can continuously and self-adaptively modulate the distortions in ERP images using deformable mechanisms. Specifically, OSRT uses a distortion-aware attention block and distortion-aware convolution block.

3. Introducing a convenient data augmentation strategy to synthesize pseudo ERP images from plain images. This helps reduce overfitting of large networks on limited ODI datasets.

In summary, the key innovations are in formulating a more appropriate downsampling process, designing a distortion-aware Transformer to handle ODI distortions, and leveraging plain images for data augmentation. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed OSRT model. The main advantage is in effectively handling distortions in ODIs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called OSRT that uses a distortion-aware Transformer to super-resolve equirectangular omnidirectional images, outperforming previous methods by modeling the image distortion and augmenting the limited training data with synthesized equirectangular patches from regular images.
