# [Automated Fusion of Multimodal Electronic Health Records for Better   Medical Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) contain heterogeneous and multimodal patient data like demographics, medical codes, time-series monitoring data, and clinical notes. Effectively modeling and fusing these complex data modalities is critical for predictive tasks like diagnosis prediction.  
- Existing approaches rely on hand-crafted neural architectures that treat all modalities equally. This fails to capture the heterogeneity and requires extensive domain expertise. Recently proposed automated approaches have limitations in their search space and optimization process.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework called AutoFM to automatically find optimal architectures for encoding and fusing multimodal EHR data.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a two-stage search space, first searching modality-specific architectures with early fusion and then late fusion architectures. This accommodates heterogeneity across modalities.
- Employs a customized loss to promote diversity during search, guiding discovery of meaningful architectures. 
- Leverages a pruning-based algorithm after search to derive the final architecture while preserving performance.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across three binary classification tasks and one multi-label diagnosis prediction task on real EHR data.
- Ablation studies highlight the necessity of multimodal input and the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations like the diversity-promoting loss term.
- Visualizations of discovered architectures prove that the method can capture complex modality interactions and explore diverse fusion strategies.

The key advantage is the ability to automatically find specialized and effective architectures for handling multimodal EHR data without extensive human intervention. Both the search space and optimization process are tailored to this problem.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neural architecture search framework, AutoFM, to automatically discover optimal architectures for encoding and fusing diverse modalities in electronic health records to improve predictive modeling of patient outcomes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework called AutoFM for automatically fusing multi-modal electronic health records (EHR) data. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Introducing a new two-stage search space that includes both modality-specific search and multi-modal fusion search to better handle the diverse modalities in EHR data.

2) Customizing the search optimization by adding a new penalty term to the DARTS formulation to promote diversity in feature selection during search.

3) Devising a pruning-based algorithm for deriving the final optimal architecture from the trained supernet while preserving performance.

Through experiments on real-world EHR data, the paper shows that AutoFM can effectively search neural architectures for fusing multi-modal EHR data and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The contributions aim to automate and improve predictive modeling with heterogeneous EHR data.
