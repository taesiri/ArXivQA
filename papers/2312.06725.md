## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "EpiDiff: Enhancing Multi-View Synthesis via Localized Epipolar-Constrained Diffusion":

Problem:
Generating consistent and high-quality novel views from a single input image to reconstruct 3D shapes. Existing methods either lack consistency between views (e.g. Zero123) or use heavy 3D modeling that is slow and produces low-quality images (e.g. SyncDreamer). 

Proposed Solution:
EpiDiff - A localized interactive multiview diffusion model that inserts a lightweight epipolar attention block into a base diffusion model (e.g. Zero123). This block enables cross-view feature interaction for neighboring views based on epipolar geometry constraints. It models 3D consistency while preserving the original feature distribution and generative capabilities of the base model.

Key Contributions:
- Lightweight epipolar attention block that interactively aggregates features from neighboring views guided by epipolar constraints. Ensures consistency while being efficient.

- Preserves base model's feature distribution and generative capacities. Module is compatible with various diffusion models.  

- Generates 16 views in 12 seconds. Outperforms baselines in quality metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS.

- Capable of generating more freely distributed views. This improves 3D reconstruction quality compared to fixed viewpoints.

In summary, EpiDiff introduces an efficient and lightweight epipolar-constrained module for multiview consistency modeling compatible with different base diffusion models. It generates high quality and consistent novel views rapidly, also across more diverse viewpoints, enabling improved single view 3D reconstruction.
