# [CAE v2: Context Autoencoder with CLIP Target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09799)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how the supervision position and mask ratio affect the performance of masked image modeling (MIM) when using CLIP features as the supervision target. Specifically, the authors investigate:

1) Whether supervising only the visible (unmasked) patches can work well compared to supervising only the masked patches or both masked and visible patches. 

2) How the optimal mask ratio correlates with model size.

To study these questions, the authors develop a simple MIM framework called CAE v2 with a CLIP target and conduct experiments analyzing the effects of supervision position and mask ratio. Their key findings are:

1) Supervising only the visible patches with CLIP features works surprisingly well, achieving better performance than supervising just masked patches. This suggests the visible patches effectively distill knowledge from CLIP's semantic representations.

2) The optimal mask ratio positively correlates with model size - smaller models favor lower mask ratios while larger models prefer higher ones. This implies model scale should inform the choice of mask ratio.

Overall, this paper aims to provide new insights into effective strategies for supervision and masking in CLIP-guided masked image modeling, especially for small-scale models. The central hypothesis is that the supervision position and mask ratio are key factors influencing MIM performance with a CLIP target.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It develops a simple masked image modeling (MIM) pipeline called Context Autoencoder with CLIP Target (CAE-v2) to study two critical elements - supervision position and mask ratio - when using CLIP as the pre-training target.

- It finds that applying supervision only on the visible image patches can achieve remarkable performance, even better than supervising just the masked patches. This shows the effectiveness of distilling knowledge from CLIP into the representations of visible patches. 

- It reveals that the optimal mask ratio is positively correlated with model size - smaller models favor lower mask ratios while larger models prefer higher mask ratios. This provides a useful guideline for choosing mask ratios based on model scale.

- Driven by these two findings, the proposed CAE-v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across various model sizes on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection/instance segmentation tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is providing insights into supervision position and mask ratio when using CLIP as the pre-training target, which leads to an effective yet simple MIM approach that works well across different model scales. The findings can serve as useful guidelines for future MIM methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple masked image modeling framework called CAE v2 using CLIP supervisions, and shows that supervising only visible patches works well and the optimal mask ratio is positively correlated with model size.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work on masked image modeling:

- The key novelty of this paper is in studying two important aspects of masked image modeling (MIM) - supervision position and mask ratio - when using CLIP features as the reconstruction target. Most prior MIM research uses RGB pixels, tokens, or momentum encoder features as targets. Using CLIP is still relatively new.

- For supervision position, the common approach in MIM is to only supervise the model predictions on masked patches. This paper finds that also supervising the visible patches with CLIP features acts like a distillation signal and leads to good performance. 

- For mask ratio, prior work uses fixed ratios while this paper shows the ratio should be higher for larger model sizes. Specifically, the optimal mask ratio positively correlates with model capacity. This is a new insight.

- The proposed simple framework, CAE v2, outperforms prior art on ImageNet classification and segmentation tasks. It also provides useful guidelines for future MIM research.

- Concurrent work like MILAN and MaskDistill also use CLIP in MIM but focus more on multi-modality and loss design. This paper's contributions on supervision and mask ratio are orthogonal and complementary.

In summary, by studying supervision and masking in a CLIP MIM framework, this paper provides useful new perspectives to guide and improve masked image modeling. The performance gains on multiple benchmarks also validate the importance of these insights.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Explore the supervision position and mask ratio with larger models like ViT-Huge and ViT-Giant. The current work is limited to models up to ViT-Large due to resource constraints. Studying larger models can provide more insights.

- Investigate other modalities beyond CLIP as supervision targets for masked image modeling. While CLIP provides rich semantics, other targets may offer complementary benefits. 

- Analyze the optimal mask sampling strategies besides random and block-wise masking. Different spatial masking patterns could potentially improve representation learning.

- Study the impacts of different decoder designs. The current work uses a simple 1-layer transformer, but more complex decoders may be useful.

- Evaluate on a wider range of downstream tasks besides image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection/instance segmentation. Other tasks like video recognition could reveal new findings.

- Explore combining the insights from this work with concurrent methods like MILAN, dBOT and MaskDistill that also use CLIP in masked image modeling. There could be complementary gains.

- Investigate dynamically changing the mask ratio and supervision during training as the model evolves rather than using fixed settings. Adaptive approaches could further optimize masked image modeling.

In summary, the key future directions are studying larger models, exploring new supervision targets and mask strategies, evaluating on more tasks, and combining insights from concurrent works on CLIP-guided masked image modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies two critical elements in masked image modeling (MIM) - the supervision position and mask ratio - when using CLIP as the supervision target. The authors develop a simple MIM pipeline called CAE v2 to conduct experiments. They find that applying supervision only on the visible image patches can achieve remarkable performance, even better than supervising just the masked patches as in standard MIM approaches. They also find the optimal mask ratio is positively correlated with model size, i.e. smaller models prefer lower mask ratios. Based on these findings, they propose guidelines for supervision position and mask ratio in CLIP-targeted MIM. Their proposed CAE v2 framework achieves superior performance on ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation across different model sizes when following these guidelines. The key takeaways are that visible patch supervision works surprisingly well for CLIP-guided MIM, and mask ratio should be adapted based on model size.
