# [INarIG: Iterative Non-autoregressive Instruct Generation Model For   Word-Level Auto Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18200)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Iterative Non-autoregressive Instruct Generation (INarIG) model for the Word-Level Auto Completion (WLAC) task in computer-aided translation. The model constructs the human typed sequence into an Instruction Unit to guide word generation, and employs iterative decoding with subwords to fully utilize the input information. Specifically, the human typed sequence is encoded into the model via character-level embedding to ensure deep fusion of information. Iterative decoding at the subword level allows utilizing context from both sides of the target word, making the model more competent for low-frequency words. To address the challenge of incomplete translation context, the model leverages pre-training on machine translation and conditional masked language models, as well as multi-task learning. Experiments on two datasets show state-of-the-art results, with over 10% maximum increase in prediction accuracy. The analysis validates the effectiveness of the Instruction Unit in guiding generation, the advantage in low-frequency words, and the benefits of the training strategies. Key limitations are the fixed iterative decoding strategy and decoding direction. Overall, the model achieves excellent performance by innovatively constructing the human typed sequence and employing iterative subword decoding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an iterative non-autoregressive instruct generation model for word-level auto completion that achieves state-of-the-art results by constructing the human typed sequence into an Instruction Unit, employing iterative decoding with subwords, and using pre-training and multi-task learning strategies to address incomplete translation context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work include:

1. Constructing the human typed sequence into an Instruction Unit and performing character-level embedding to ensure deep information fusion at the encoding phase.

2. Using iterative decoding at the subword level to ensure compatibility with context dependencies on both sides of the target word, making the model more competent at handling low-frequency words. 

3. Utilizing pre-training and multi-task learning strategies to efficiently address the challenge of incomplete translation context in the WLAC task.

In summary, the key innovations of this work are in deeply fusing the human typed sequence into the model via an Instruction Unit, using iterative subword decoding to better handle low-frequency words, and leveraging pre-training and multi-task learning to deal with incomplete context. These contributions help the proposed model achieve new state-of-the-art results on WLAC benchmarks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Word-Level Auto Completion (WLAC): The main task that is the focus of the paper, which involves predicting a target word given a source sentence, translation context, and a human typed character sequence.

- Instruction Unit: A representation the authors construct from the human typed sequence to provide instructions to the model to guide word generation. Encoded at the character level.

- Iterative decoding: The authors employ an iterative decoding strategy at the subword level, decoding one subword token per iteration to form the final target word. Inspired by non-autoregressive translation models.

- Conditional masked decoding: The overall model structure uses a conditional masked language model, with a [MASK] token serving as the decoding anchor. Allows the model to leverage context from both sides.

- Pre-training and multi-task learning: Strategies proposed to address the challenge of incomplete translation context. Involve pre-training on translation tasks and multi-task learning with conditional masked language modeling.

- Low-frequency words: A core challenge in WLAC that the authors aim to address, since translators most need autoccompletions for uncommon words. The subword iterative decoding helps with this.

- Code-switching: A strategy for Chinese text to learn mappings between Chinese characters and Pinyin (phonetic symbols). Involves randomly converting some Chinese words to Pinyin during training.
