# [Gradient-based Discrete Sampling with Automatic Cyclical Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Discrete distributions, especially in high-dimensional deep models, tend to be highly multimodal due to inherent discontinuities. 
- Gradient-based discrete sampling methods are effective but can get trapped in local modes, failing to fully characterize such multimodal target distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Automatic Cyclical Scheduling" to enable efficient exploration and accurate sampling of multimodal discrete distributions. 
- The method incorporates (1) a cyclical step size schedule where large steps discover new modes and small steps exploit each mode; (2) a cyclical "balancing" schedule to ensure high-efficiency balanced proposals for each step size; and (3) an automatic tuning scheme to configure the cyclical schedules across diverse datasets.

Key Contributions:
- First gradient-based discrete sampler targeting multimodal distributions, using cyclical schedules for step size and balancing parameter.
- An automatic tuning algorithm that configures the cyclical schedules with minimal overhead.
- Non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and inference bounds for the proposed method.
- Demonstrates superior performance in sampling complex multimodal distributions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Energy-Based Models. Also shows improved learning of these models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the paper tackles a key weakness of gradient-based discrete samplers in characterizing multimodality through an elegant cyclical scheduling approach and automatic tuning scheme. Both theoretically and empirically it establishes strong results, advancing the state-of-the-art in this domain.
