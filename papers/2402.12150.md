# [Your Large Language Model is Secretly a Fairness Proponent and You   Should Prompt it Like One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12150)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language models (LLMs) frequently exhibit unfairness by prioritizing dominant perspectives from majority parties while overlooking alternative viewpoints from minority parties when discussing fairness-related issues. 

- This occurs because LLMs tend to adopt a default human personality representing the training data majority, leading to biased expressions.

- Crafting representative roles and debaters to encourage diverse perspectives is complex. Summarizing the various perspectives into a coherent, balanced conclusion is also difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FairThinking, an automated multi-agent pipeline designed to enhance and evaluate LLM fairness.

- It automatically generates relevant stakeholder roles with rich identites and details to faithfully represent different perspectives. 

- These roles engage in guided debates led by an impartial clerk who summarizes viewpoints and draws balanced conclusions.

- Inspired by jury principles, new roles judge the debate conclusions to evaluate fairness. More jurors favoring the conclusion indicates greater fairness.

Key Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates that role prompting can elicit diverse LLM viewpoints and biases stem from partial training data distributions.

- Introduces an innovative approach using automated role generation and multi-agent debates to encourage, summarize and evaluate diverse perspectives for fairer LLM expressions.

- Constructs a dataset with 1,004 controversial, socially impactful questions covering three fairness topics and six attributes. 

- Extensive experiments on four LLMs demonstrate FairThinking's ability to reduce biased expressions and aligned answers while improving viewpoint diversity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a pipeline called FairThinking that uses automated role assignment and multi-agent debates to elicit diverse perspectives from large language models on fairness-related issues, leading to fairer expressions that incorporate more viewpoints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a pipeline called FairThinking that aims to enhance the fairness of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) The paper reveals that existing conversational LLMs frequently tend to express the dominant perspectives of majority parties while ignoring alternative viewpoints, especially those from minority parties, when dealing with fairness-related issues. 

2) The paper hypothesizes that unfairness arises because LLMs take on the role of representing majority parties by default. Experiments confirm that role prompting can elicit diverse perspectives from LLMs.

3) Building on these insights, the paper develops FairThinking, an automated multi-agent pipeline designed to assign relevant stakeholder roles and engage them in debates to extract deeper perspectives on fairness issues. It also utilizes jury roles to evaluate the fairness of debate conclusions.

4) The paper creates a dataset of 1004 fairness-related questions across three categories to evaluate LLMs' fairness more thoroughly. Experiments on four LLMs demonstrate FairThinking's effectiveness in mitigating bias and incorporating more diverse viewpoints.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating an automated pipeline to enhance fairness in LLMs by impartially summarizing perspectives from automatically prompted roles in debates.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Fairness
- Bias
- Prompt engineering
- Role prompting
- Multi-agent debate
- Jury evaluation
- Dataset creation
- GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2, Mistral

The paper discusses issues with fairness and bias in large language models, and proposes a new method called "FairThinking" to improve fairness. The key ideas are using role prompting to elicit diverse perspectives, having multiple agents debate to summarize different viewpoints, and evaluating the debate conclusions with an AI jury. The method is evaluated on a newly created dataset of controversial questions related to fairness. Experiments are conducted with several state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2 and Mistral.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an automated pipeline called FairThinking to enhance fairness in large language models. Can you elaborate on the key components of FairThinking and how they work together to improve fairness? 

2. One key insight from the paper is that large language models tend to exhibit the viewpoints of majority parties when discussing fairness-related issues. Can you explain this observation in more detail and why it leads to unfairness?

3. The paper utilizes role prompting to elicit diverse perspectives from large language models. Can you describe the process of automated role generation in FairThinking and how it faithfully represents different parties?  

4. The paper designs a multi-agent debate mechanism for FairThinking. Can you explain the debate format, the role of the clerk, and how debate facilitates the extraction of deeper viewpoints?

5. The paper evaluates fairness using real-world jury principles and roles. Can you describe the jury setup in FairThinking, the voting mechanism, and how it aligns with human assessment of fairness?

6. Can you analyze the experimental results in Table 1 and highlight the key strengths of FairThinking across different language models and question types? What insights do the results provide?

7. The paper conducts an ablation study in Table 2. Can you explain the impact of removing debate or role prompting on the performance of FairThinking? What does this imply?  

8. Can you walk through the case studies in Tables 3-5 and contrast the perspectives provided by the backbone LM versus FairThinking? What additional viewpoints does FairThinking cover?

9. What are some limitations of the proposed FairThinking approach? How can the method be improved or expanded for more comprehensive fairness enhancement? 

10. The paper focuses on fairness regarding selected demographic attributes like gender and race. Can you suggest other applications or domains where FairThinking could be beneficial for encouraging fair and multi-perspective expressions?
