# [Conditional Contrastive Learning with Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05458)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research question this paper addresses is: How can we overcome the limitation of insufficient samples for some values of the conditioning variable in conditional contrastive learning?The key idea is that in conditional contrastive learning frameworks like weakly supervised, fair, and hard negatives contrastive learning, the conditional sampling procedure requires sufficient data samples associated with each value of the conditioning variable. However, in many real-world scenarios, some values may not have enough (or any) associated data samples. This is especially problematic when the conditioning variable is high-dimensional or continuous.To address this, the paper proposes a new method called Conditional Contrastive Learning with Kernel (CCL-K). The key idea is to avoid explicitly sampling data pairs from the conditional distributions like P(X|Z=z)P(Y|Z=z). Instead, CCL-K uses the Kernel Conditional Embedding Operator to sample and assign weights to all available data based on the similarity of their conditioning variable values to the target z. This allows making use of the entire dataset even when no samples exist with an exact z value.The experiments show CCL-K consistently outperforms previous conditional contrastive learning baselines that rely on explicit conditional sampling, especially in low sample regimes. So in summary, the paper proposes a novel kernel-based approach to overcome insufficient conditioning samples in conditional contrastive learning.
