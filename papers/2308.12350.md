# [Diffusion-based Image Translation with Label Guidance for Domain   Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12350)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve domain adaptive semantic segmentation by incorporating source domain labels to guide cross-domain image translation?The key hypothesis is that using source domain labels to explicitly guide the image translation process will help preserve semantic details and consistency between the translated images and source labels. This should then improve the performance of domain adaptive semantic segmentation models trained on the translated images. Specifically, the paper proposes a diffusion model based image translation framework and introduces two main components:1) Semantic Gradient Guidance (SGG): Uses source domain labels to guide the diffusion model's image translation process via gradient signals, preserving semantic details.2) Progressive Translation Learning (PTL): Progressively translates images across minor domain gaps to enable SGG to reliably work across a large domain discrepancy. The central hypothesis is that by incorporating source domain labels through SGG and bridging the domain gap via PTL, the proposed method can achieve improved performance in domain adaptive semantic segmentation compared to prior image translation methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks verify this hypothesis and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.In summary, the core research question is how to utilize source domain labels to guide cross-domain image translation for improving domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which is addressed through the proposed SGG and PTL components. The experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel label-guided image translation framework based on denoising diffusion models to address the problem of domain adaptive semantic segmentation (DASS). Specifically, the key contributions are:1. The paper proposes to exploit denoising diffusion models for image translation in DASS, which is the first attempt to use diffusion models for this task. A diffusion-based baseline model is developed.2. To enable semantic consistency during image translation, the paper proposes a novel Semantic Gradient Guidance (SGG) scheme to guide the translation process based on source domain labels. SGG contains a Local Class-regional Guidance (LCG) module and a Global Scene-harmonious Guidance (GSG) module.3. A Progressive Translation Learning (PTL) strategy is designed to facilitate SGG to work reliably across domains with large gaps. PTL decomposes the domain gap by generating intermediate domains.4. Comprehensive experiments on two DASS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches. The method brings significant improvements over existing GAN-based image translation techniques.In summary, the core contribution is developing a diffusion-based image translation framework that can transfer source labels precisely to guide the image translation process in DASS. The label guidance enables the model to preserve semantic details during translation. The proposed techniques of SGG and PTL allow the guidance to work effectively across domains.
