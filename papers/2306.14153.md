# [DomainStudio: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models for Domain-Driven Image   Generation using Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14153)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt diffusion models pre-trained on large datasets to new target domains using extremely limited data (e.g. 10 images) in order to generate high-quality and diverse samples. The key points are:- Directly fine-tuning diffusion models on limited data leads to overfitting, lacking diversity and detail. - The paper proposes "DomainStudio", a novel approach to adapt diffusion models to new domains using very few samples. - DomainStudio has two main components:  - Pairwise similarity loss to maintain diversity of samples.  - Losses to enhance high-frequency details in the adapted samples.- Experiments show DomainStudio generates higher quality and more diverse samples compared to fine-tuning diffusion models directly or using other GAN adaptation techniques.- The approach is compatible with both unconditional and conditional (text-to-image) diffusion models.In summary, the main hypothesis is that using the proposed DomainStudio approach, diffusion models can be adapted to new target domains using just a few samples (e.g. 10 images) while maintaining quality and diversity much better than existing techniques. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.
