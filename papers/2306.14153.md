# [DomainStudio: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models for Domain-Driven Image   Generation using Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14153)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt diffusion models pre-trained on large datasets to new target domains using extremely limited data (e.g. 10 images) in order to generate high-quality and diverse samples. The key points are:- Directly fine-tuning diffusion models on limited data leads to overfitting, lacking diversity and detail. - The paper proposes "DomainStudio", a novel approach to adapt diffusion models to new domains using very few samples. - DomainStudio has two main components:  - Pairwise similarity loss to maintain diversity of samples.  - Losses to enhance high-frequency details in the adapted samples.- Experiments show DomainStudio generates higher quality and more diverse samples compared to fine-tuning diffusion models directly or using other GAN adaptation techniques.- The approach is compatible with both unconditional and conditional (text-to-image) diffusion models.In summary, the main hypothesis is that using the proposed DomainStudio approach, diffusion models can be adapted to new target domains using just a few samples (e.g. 10 images) while maintaining quality and diversity much better than existing techniques. The experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes DomainStudio, a novel approach to adapt pretrained diffusion models to new target domains using limited data (e.g. 10 images). - It is the first work to introduce diffusion models for few-shot image generation. Previous works on few-shot image generation focused on GANs.- It proposes two main techniques to avoid overfitting and maintain diversity when adapting diffusion models with little data:   1) Pairwise similarity loss to keep relative distances between generated images similar to the source model.   2) High-frequency detail enhancement to retain details from the source model and learn new details from target data.- It shows DomainStudio achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to GAN-based few-shot image generation methods, generating more realistic and diverse images.- It demonstrates DomainStudio can adapt both unconditional image generation models and conditional text-to-image models using very limited data.- For unconditional generation, it enables novel applications like generating diverse paintings in an artist's style from a few examples. - For text-to-image generation, it allows adapting models to new domains/styles described by just a few images, while retaining diversity of generated content.In summary, this paper introduces diffusion models to few-shot image generation for the first time and proposes effective techniques to adapt them using very limited target data, outperforming prior GAN-based approaches. It has applications in both unconditional and text-conditional image generation.
