# [InMD-X: Large Language Models for Internal Medicine Doctors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language models for healthcare treat it as a single domain and overlook intricacies of various medical subspecialties. This one-size-fits-all approach is not optimal.  
- Each medical subspecialty has distinct language, requirements and intricacies. Need models tailored for granularity.

Solution:
- Developed InMD-X - a collection of 11 large language models fine-tuned for subspecialties in internal medicine: allergy, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious disease, oncology, pulmonology, rheumatology, nephrology/urology, and general internal medicine.

Methods:
- Curated domain-specific datasets by extracting 397K papers from 1669 top specialty journals in PubMed since 2010.  
- Pretrained models on datasets in self-supervised way.
- Created QA datasets from paper abstracts using GPT-3.5 findings. 
- Fine-tuned models on QA datasets.  
- Applied parameter efficient tuning for multiple model training.

Results: 
- Custom datasets showed variability across subspecialties in volume and diversity.
- Models exhibit distinct learning curves based on data differences. 
- InMD-X provides more accurate and relevant responses compared to general model.
- LORA based efficient tuning enables loading subsets of models as needed.

Contributions:
- Novel approach to develop specialized language models aligned with intricacies of granular medical subdomains.  
- Innovative method to construct domain-specific medical QA datasets.
- Suite of performant models catering to various internal medicine disciplines.

The paper introduces InMD-X, which is a suite of large language models tailored for various internal medicine sub-specialties. It discusses the methodology for constructing specialized datasets by extracting papers from PubMed journals for each sub-specialty. The models undergo pre-training on the medical papers, followed by fine-tuning on QA dataset pairs generated from paper abstracts. Approaches like parameter-efficient learning are employed during training. Experiments related to model inference time and loss curves are presented. The key focus areas relate to constructing practical medical language models aligned with specialty-specific demands, training methodology, and model optimization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions redefining internal medicine into 11 sub-categories. What were the criteria used for dividing internal medicine into these specific sub-specialties? Could there be alternative ways to categorize them?

2. The paper extracts abstracts from top 10% journals in each sub-specialty as per Journal Citation Reports (JCR). What is the rationale behind using only top 10% journals instead of a broader selection? How does journal quality impact model performance?

3. The paper uses a 2-step process to construct sub-specialty specific corpora - selecting queries and then extracting papers. What are the limitations of this approach? Could more advanced methods like clustering algorithms be explored? 

4. The paper extracts around 5 key findings per abstract for the QA dataset. On what basis was this number chosen? How does the number of key findings per abstract impact model training?

5. What are the ethical considerations around using commercial APIs like GPT-3.5 for medical dataset creation? Does automation remove human accountability in ensuring data quality?

6. The training methodology uses continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Why is self-supervised pre-training alone not sufficient? What is the rationale behind supervised fine-tuning?

7. Parameter efficient fine-tuning is claimed to be suitable when multiple models need to be used. Can you suggest some real-world medical use cases where such multi-model scenarios are likely?

8. How can the inferences from multiple sub-specialty models be consolidated effectively? Should an ensemble approach like Mixture-of-Experts be explored?

9. The paper lacks quantitative evaluation metrics. What benchmarks could be used to evaluate sub-specialty specific models? How can human medical expert evaluations supplement metrics?

10. Medical knowledge and best practices evolve continuously. How can the model be kept up-to-date? Should model re-training be continuous or periodic? What could be the update frequency?
