# [Delving into Discrete Normalizing Flows on SO(3) Manifold for   Probabilistic Rotation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to develop effective normalizing flows on the rotation manifold SO(3) for probabilistic modeling of rotations. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Existing normalizing flows in Euclidean space or general Riemannian manifolds cannot be directly applied to SO(3) due to its unique topology and geometry. 

2) By combining proposed building blocks of Mobius coupling layers and quaternion affine transformations, the resulting normalizing flow model can effectively represent complex multimodal distributions on SO(3).

3) The proposed rotation normalizing flows can be applied to both unconditional modeling of distributions on SO(3) as well as conditional modeling of rotation distributions given observations.

4) The proposed rotation normalizing flows will outperform existing methods for probabilistic modeling and regression on SO(3), by leveraging the flexibility and invertibility of normalizing flows.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop tailored normalizing flow models on SO(3) to enable flexible and accurate probabilistic modeling and inference for rotations. The key hypotheses are around the need for specialized techniques for SO(3) and the potential benefits of the proposed normalizing flow framework.
