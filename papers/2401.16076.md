# [Find the Cliffhanger: Multi-Modal Trailerness in Soap Operas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16076)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Creating trailers for long videos like movies or TV shows requires manually selecting and editing together brief enticing moments, which is time-consuming. 
- Determining which moments have high "trailerness" (suitability for inclusion in a trailer) depends on both visual appeal and dialogue information.  
- Most prior work does not adequately capture the multi-modal or multi-scale nature of determining trailerness.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a "Trailerness Transformer" that makes multi-modal, multi-scale predictions of trailerness using both visual and textual features of videos.
- Visual features are extracted at clip (2.5 sec) and shot scales using I3D network. Text features come from subtitle embeddings.  
- Individual transformers are trained on each modality-scale combination. Their predictions are fused to leverage complementary information.
- Editors' choices in existing trailers are used to generate pseudo-labels for supervising trailerness prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Multi-modal multi-scale transformer approach to predicting video trailerness.
- Introduction of new "GTST" soap opera dataset with trailers and subtitles for 63 episodes. Uniquely has editor-selected labels and is openly available.
- Experiments showing multi-modal fusion outperforms unimodal baselines. Combining textual shot-level with visual clip-level features works best.
- Analysis relating prediction scores to emotionally-charged visuals and urgent textual calls to action.

The paper demonstrates the complexity of determining trailerness and shows quantitatively and qualitatively how a multi-modal multi-scale approach captures relevant contextual information for this creative editing task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a multi-modal, multi-scale method to predict trailerness (suitability for use in a trailer) in videos by training transformers on editor-selected trailer moments from a new soap opera dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a multi-modal and multi-scale method for predicting the "trailerness" of moments in long-form videos to assist in selecting clips for trailers. Specifically:

- They introduce the concept of "trailerness" as a score indicating how suitable a video frame or sequence is for inclusion in a trailer.

- They present a dataset of soap opera episodes matched with trailer sequences to establish ground truth labels for trailerness.

- They propose a multi-modal (visual and textual features) and multi-scale (clip and shot level encodings) transformer-based model to predict trailerness scores. 

- They evaluate combinations of modalities and temporal scales, finding that fusing a visual stream at the clip level with both textual and visual streams at the shot level works best.

- They compare to baselines like random selection and video summarization methods, demonstrating the benefits of their approach.

In summary, the key contribution is the multi-modal and multi-scale transformer-based model for predicting trailerness to assist in selecting clips for trailers, enabled by a new dataset with editor-curated trailerness labels.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a multi-modal and multi-scale approach to predicting trailerness. Why is considering multiple modalities (visual and textual) and multiple temporal scales (clip and shot level) beneficial for this task? 

2. The paper extracts features using pre-trained models like I3D and MiniLM. How do you think the choice of pre-trained model impacts the overall performance of the method? Would using other state-of-the-art models for video and text yield better results?

3. The method uses a transformer architecture for each combination of modality and temporal scale. What are the benefits of using a transformer over other sequence modeling architectures like RNNs or CNNs? How does the self-attention mechanism help capture dependencies related to trailerness?

4. The paper evaluates multiple fusion approaches for combining the predictions from the different transformer streams. Why does the triplet combination of visual clip, textual shot and visual shot level perform the best? What is the intuition behind this?

5. The method is evaluated on a new soap opera dataset GTST. What are some key properties of this dataset that make it suitable for studying trailerness prediction? How does it compare to existing datasets?

6. The paper frames trailer generation as a form of biased video summarization. What is the key difference between video summarization and trailer generation that leads to this characterization? 

7. Only using visual features at shot level results in lower performance compared to the clip level. What could explain this difference in the context of predicting trailerness?

8. The method relies on obtaining pseudo labels using perceptual hashing between trailers and full videos. What are some limitations of this approach? How could the labeling be improved?

9. The quantitative results demonstrate this is a challenging task, with F1 scores around 9%. What factors contribute to the complexity of predicting trailerness automatically?

10. The paper demonstrates both quantitative and qualitative analyses. What additional insights do the qualitative results provide compared to only reporting quantitative performance? How could the qualitative evaluation be expanded?
