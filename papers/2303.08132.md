# [InstMove: Instance Motion for Object-centric Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08132)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve video instance segmentation and tracking methods using instance-level motion information. 

The key hypothesis is that modeling motion at the instance-level rather than just pixel-level optical flow will be more robust and beneficial for these tasks, especially in complex scenarios with occlusion or fast motion.

Specifically, the paper proposes:

- InstMove, a flexible motion prediction module that operates on instance masks to directly model position and shape changes over time. This captures instance-level motion patterns.

- Integrating InstMove into state-of-the-art video instance segmentation and tracking methods with minimal modification, to provide robust motion information. 

- Experiments demonstrating InstMove improves performance on challenging datasets featuring occlusion and fast motion, boosting prior state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that instance-level motion modeling is more effective than pixel-level optical flow for complex video understanding tasks involving tracking object instances over time. The proposed InstMove module and experiments aim to demonstrate this.
