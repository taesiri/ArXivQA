# [Interactions with Prompt Problems: A New Way to Teach Programming with   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are disrupting computing education by being able to easily solve basic programming problems when prompted correctly. 
- This threatens traditional pedagogies focused on students writing lots of code from scratch.  
- New ways of teaching programming that utilize LLMs are needed.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose "Prompt Problems" - a new type of programming problem where students are given a visual representation of the problem and must translate that into a prompt that will generate correct code when fed to an LLM.

- They built a tool called "Promptly" to deliver Prompt Problems. It works iteratively - students write a prompt, submit it, see the code generated and test cases, then refine their prompt until the code passes all test cases.

Main Contributions:
- Details the design of Prompt Problems and the Promptly tool.

- Through an exploratory study, pilot study, and large-scale study, analyzes how students interact with Prompt Problems.

- Identifies three key interaction patterns enabled by Prompt Problems: play, iteration, and reflection.

- Discusses how Prompt Problems teach programming concepts while encouraging metacognition and self-directed learning in the era of LLMs.

- Proposes Prompt Problems as an important new programming pedagogy uniquely suited for computing education with LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces Prompt Problems as a novel approach to teaching programming that embraces generative AI models like ChatGPT. By scaffolding the learning experience around iteratively creating prompts and analyzing the resulting code, Prompt Problems enable new forms of play, iteration, and reflection compared to traditional programming assignments. The paper provides evidence that Prompt Problems facilitate productive student interactions for learning computing concepts in the age of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces "Prompt Problems", a new type of programming problem for the era of large language models where students are presented a problem visually and must iteratively refine a natural language prompt to generate code that solves the problem, allowing them to learn programming concepts through decomposition, specification, code reading, debugging, and reflection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new type of programming problem called "Prompt Problems" where students are given a visual representation of a coding problem and must write a prompt to get a large language model (LLM) to generate code that solves the problem. This teaches students to decompose problems, explain solutions in plain English, read generated code, and debug through iterative prompt refinement.

2. It details the design and implementation of a tool called "Promptly" that was created to deliver Prompt Problems to students and facilitate iterative prompt writing and code generation from an LLM. The paper discusses design considerations made when building this tool.

3. Through a series of studies - an exploratory study, a pilot study, and a large-scale study - the paper examines how students interact with Prompt Problems and Promptly. Both quantitative data on student submissions and qualitative reflective data provide insights into student problem-solving processes and perceptions of learning from Prompt Problems.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of Prompt Problems as an innovative way to teach programming concepts in the era of large language models, along with empirical evidence examining student interactions with this new type of problem. The paper also makes a secondary contribution in detailing the design of a supporting tool for Prompt Problems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces "Prompt Problems" as a new type of programming problem for the era of large language models. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to traditional programming problems focused solely on writing code?

2. The iterative process of refining prompts seems central to learning with Prompt Problems. What are some ways an instructor could provide additional scaffolding or support for students as they go through this iterative process? 

3. The qualitative results highlight issues some students faced in achieving the appropriate level of specificity in their prompts. What changes could be made to the prompt problem design or the Promptly tool itself to help students write prompts at the right level of detail?

4. Could the non-deterministic nature of language models pose additional challenges for students learning with Prompt Problems? If so, how might an instructor help students develop more robust prompts?

5. The paper identifies several interesting interaction patterns with Prompt Problems like "Play" and "Reflection." What are some other potential interaction patterns or behaviors you might expect to see as students engage with these problems?  

6. How suitable do you think Prompt Problems would be for more advanced programming concepts beyond introductory courses? What adaptations might be needed?

7. The paper focuses solely on Python programming problems. How do you think Prompt Problems would need to be designed differently for other programming languages?

8. Beyond programming education, what other potential applications of the Prompt Problem concept seem promising for computer science or technical education more broadly?

9. The paper highlights issues of generalizability given the single university context. What key contextual factors do you think may influence the success of Prompt Problems? 

10. How does the Prompt Problem approach compare to other efforts aimed at preparing students for the age of AI assistants and autonomous coding? What unique advantages or limitations does it have?
