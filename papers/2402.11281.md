# [Can Large Multimodal Models Uncover Deep Semantics Behind Images?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11281)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the deep semantics (underlying meanings beyond superficial interpretation) of images is important for high-level intelligence. 
- Prior work has focused more on surface-level image understanding and lacks systematic investigation of visual deep semantics.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces DeepEval, a new benchmark to assess large multimodal models' capacity for visual deep semantics understanding.
- DeepEval includes a human-annotated dataset of 1,001 cartoons with description, title, and deep semantics for each image.
- It also features three progressive subtasks: fine-grained description selection, in-depth title matching, and deep semantics understanding through multiple choice questions.

Main Contributions:  
- Evaluation of 9 open-source LMMs and GPT-4V on DeepEval, revealing a substantial gap between their deep semantics comprehension and human performance. 
- Analysis showing that incorporating description texts notably enhances LMMs' perception of deep semantics.
- Detailed analysis within image categories, finding relative strengths and weaknesses of models across different semantics facets.
- A new dataset and tasks to promote research into models capable of comprehending visual content's profound semantics.

In summary, the paper tackles the limited prior analysis of visual deep semantics by introducing a comprehensive benchmark and dataset to evaluate and improve LMMs' understanding in this challenging area resembling high-level human cognition.
