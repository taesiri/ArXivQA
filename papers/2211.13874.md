# [FFHQ-UV: Normalized Facial UV-Texture Dataset for 3D Face Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13874)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to construct a large-scale, high-quality facial UV-texture dataset from in-the-wild images that can improve 3D face reconstruction. Specifically, the paper aims to create a facial UV-texture dataset with the following desired characteristics:- Large-scale with high diversity- High-quality texture maps that are evenly illuminated, have neutral expressions, and no occlusions (e.g. hair, glasses)- Can serve as facial assets for realistic 3D face rendering under different lighting conditions- Improves fidelity and quality of 3D face reconstruction from imagesTo achieve this, the key challenges are:1) The uncontrolled conditions of in-the-wild face images cannot directly provide high-quality textures2) From a single image, the complete facial texture cannot be obtained 3) Imperfect face alignment causes artifacts when unwrapping texturesTo address these challenges, the paper proposes a pipeline involving:1) Using StyleGAN-based editing to generate multi-view normalized faces from single images2) An elaborated texture extraction, correction and completion procedure 3) Training a GAN-based texture decoder for 3D face reconstructionThe central hypothesis is that this pipeline can produce a large-scale, high-quality facial UV-texture dataset from in-the-wild images, which can improve fidelity and quality of 3D face reconstruction compared to existing datasets and methods. Experiments demonstrate the diversity, quality, and utility of the proposed dataset and approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a new large-scale facial UV-texture dataset called FFHQ-UV. The main contributions are:- FFHQ-UV contains over 50,000 high-quality facial texture UV-maps that are evenly illuminated, have neutral expressions, and cleaned facial regions (no hair or accessories). This makes them suitable as facial assets for realistic 3D renderings. - A fully automatic pipeline is proposed to produce the dataset from in-the-wild face images. It utilizes recent advances in GANs and facial editing to generate normalized face images, followed by elaborate procedures for texture extraction, correction and completion.- Experiments show the dataset improves both fidelity and quality of 3D face reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods. A GAN-based texture decoder trained on FFHQ-UV gives superior reconstructed textures that are ready for relighting.- The large scale and high quality of FFHQ-UV advances research towards practical 3D face reconstruction. The dataset and code are made publicly available.In summary, the key contribution is the large-scale, high-quality FFHQ-UV dataset that enables more accurate and realistic 3D face reconstruction. The automated pipeline, improved results, and public availability also make valuable contributions.
