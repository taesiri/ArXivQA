# [Transformer Interpretability Beyond Attention Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09838)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate improved explanations for the decisions made by Transformer models? 

Specifically, the authors note that prior methods for explaining Transformer models like attention maps or relevance propagation have various limitations. Attention maps only look at one component of the self-attention heads and don't consider the full model. Existing relevance propagation methods like LRP don't work well with Transformers due to challenges like skip connections, attention mechanisms, and non-ReLU activations. 

To address these limitations, the authors propose a new method to compute and propagate relevance scores through Transformer networks in a way that handles attention layers, skip connections, and maintains the total relevance. Their central hypothesis is that this new propagation method will produce superior explanations compared to prior approaches.

The paper then validates this hypothesis through experiments on visual Transformer models like ViT and BERT models for NLP. They benchmark their approach on perturbation tests, segmentation, and a language reasoning task and demonstrate improved performance over attention maps, raw LRP, and other existing methods like GradCAM and rollout. Overall, the central thrust is developing an improved way to explain the predictions of Transformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel method to compute relevance for Transformer networks that assigns local relevance based on the Deep Taylor Decomposition principle and propagates these relevance scores through the layers. 

2. It handles the challenges of propagating relevance through Transformer networks by proposing solutions for non-parametric layers like attention and skip connections. This includes a normalization technique to maintain the total relevance.

3. It integrates the attention and relevance scores in a class-specific manner to produce visual explanations. This results in the method being inherently class-specific.

4. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments on visual and textual Transformer models. The method outperforms existing explainability techniques like attention maps, LRP, GradCAM etc. on tasks like image segmentation, positive/negative perturbation and language reasoning.

In summary, the key contribution is a new methodology to generate class-specific explanations for Transformer models by propagating and integrating relevance in a principled manner. This enables better interpretation of these powerful models. The strength of the approach is shown through superior results on vision and language tasks compared to previous techniques.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of transformer interpretability:

- The main contribution of this paper is developing a new method for assigning relevance scores and visualizing decisions in transformer models like BERT. Most prior work has focused on using attention weights directly as a way to explain transformer models. However, as this paper argues, attention weights provide an incomplete picture and can highlight irrelevant tokens.

- This paper proposes propagating relevance scores through all layers of a transformer using principles like Deep Taylor Decomposition. Their method handles unique challenges of transformers like skip connections and attention layers. Other methods like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) have struggled with some aspects of transformer architectures.

- A key advantage claimed is that this new method produces class-specific visualizations, unlike attention weights and other methods like LRP that are class-agnostic in practice. Producing class-specific explanations is important for understanding decisions. The paper shows examples where their method highlights different parts of an image depending on the target class.

- The paper evaluates the new method on a diverse set of vision and NLP datasets, including segmentation, perturbation analysis, and a language rationale extraction task. The proposed approach outperforms baselines like attention, LRP, GradCAM, and rollout across these benchmarks.

- Compared to other propagation-based methods like LRP, this paper handles unique aspects of transformers like skip connections and multiple attention layers. It also integrates both relevance and gradient information to improve explanations. The ablation studies demonstrate the importance of these contributions.

- Overall, this paper makes significant advances in transformer interpretability by developing a relevance propagation method tailored to key properties of transformers. The thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluation on vision and language tasks shows the promise of this approach compared to existing techniques.

In summary, this paper moves beyond using just attention weights for transformer interpretability, handles unique challenges of transformers, produces class-specific explanations, and demonstrates effectiveness on diverse vision and NLP tasks. It makes important progress compared to prior work in developing relevance propagation techniques for state-of-the-art transformer models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the proposed interpretability method to Transformer models in other domains beyond vision and language, such as bioinformatics, time series, graph data, etc. The authors mention their method is generic and could be extended to other types of Transformer architectures.

- Evaluating the method on additional explainability benchmarks and datasets, especially ones that provide rationales or justifications from human experts. The authors tested their method on image and text datasets but note there is room for more comprehensive benchmarking.

- Developing improved methods for mapping the token-level explanations back to the original inputs, e.g. images or text. The paper mentions limitations of relying on the pretrained tokenizer when visualizing text explanations. Better input reconstruction could improve faithfulness. 

- Extending the approach to provide more fine-grained explanations at the layer and head levels within Transformers, rather than treating the full model as a black box. The authors suggest drilling down could provide insights into the roles of different components.

- Adapting the method to generate counterfactual explanations, to identify minimal changes to the input that would change the model's prediction. The authors propose this as a way to enhance the explanations.

- Applying the visually interpretable explanations to improve downstream applications like weakly supervised localization and segmentation. The authors mention this as a promising direction.

- Developing interactive interfaces and user studies to assess the utility of the explanations for users, compared to other methods. The authors note user evaluation is an important area for future work.

So in summary, the main suggested directions are extending the approach to new domains and tasks, more comprehensive evaluation, improving input reconstruction, providing finer-grained and counterfactual explanations, and assessing utility for end users. The authors position their work as an initial step toward better interpreting Transformers.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for interpreting and visualizing predictions from Transformer models. Transformers and self-attention models have become very popular for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, their internal workings are complex and difficult to interpret. Most prior work has tried to interpret Transformers by only looking at the attention weights. This paper argues that attention weights alone do not provide a complete understanding of the model. 

The authors propose a new method that computes relevance scores based on the Deep Taylor Decomposition principle. It then propagates these relevance scores through all layers of the Transformer, including attention layers and skip connections. The method handles challenges with skip connections and attention layers to maintain proper relevance attribution. Experiments on vision and language tasks show the method provides better explanation and segmentation compared to prior approaches. The visualizations are also class-specific, unlike previous methods. The code for the method is provided to enable further research. Overall, this paper demonstrates a novel way to generate more accurate and insightful explanations from Transformer models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Transformer Interpretability Beyond Attention Visualization":

The paper proposes a new method for generating visual explanations of decisions made by Transformer models. The key ideas are 1) assigning local relevance scores to model components based on the Deep Taylor Decomposition principle, 2) propagating these relevance scores through all layers of the model in a way that maintains the total relevance and handles issues like skip connections and attention layers, and 3) integrating the relevance scores with gradient information to produce final class-specific explanation maps. Specifically, relevance scores are computed using a modified layer-wise relevance propagation rule that considers only positive attributions. These scores are normalized when propagating through skip connections and attention layers to avoid numerical instability and maintain the total relevance. The relevance is then combined with gradients of the attention maps to weigh the attention coefficients. This weighted attention is aggregated across layers to produce the final explanation heatmap for the input tokens related to the classification. A key advantage is generating visualizations specific to target classes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper addresses the problem of interpreting and explaining the predictions of Transformer models, which are increasingly popular in NLP and computer vision tasks. 

Specifically, the authors point out that existing methods for visualizing and understanding Transformers often rely only on the attention maps, which provide limited insight into the full model. They note deficiencies in other methods like gradient-based approaches and relevance propagation techniques when applied to Transformers. 

The main question the paper seems to be addressing is: How can we develop better methods to explain the predictions of Transformer models in vision and language tasks, in a way that provides more complete and consistent visualizations of the parts of the input that led to a particular output?

The authors propose a new method that assigns local relevancy scores using principles from Deep Taylor Decomposition, and then carefully propagates these through the layers of Transformers, handling challenges like skip connections and attention mechanisms. Their goal is to generate class-specific visualizations that identify the key parts of the input that influenced the model's predictions.

In summary, this paper aims to develop an improved approach to Transformer interpretability that goes beyond just visualizing attention, and provides more coherent explanations of the model's reasoning in computer vision and NLP tasks.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for visualizing and explaining the decisions of Transformer models. Transformers, which utilize self-attention mechanisms, are becoming increasingly popular for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging compared to CNNs. Existing methods rely solely on attention scores or make simplistic assumptions about attention propagation. This paper introduces a technique to assign relevance scores to input tokens based on the Deep Taylor Decomposition principle. It then propagates these scores through the network layers, handling challenges like skip connections and attention matrices to maintain attribution conservation. For vision Transformers, it generates a class-specific heatmap highlighting important image regions. Experiments on ImageNet classification and sentiment analysis show it outperforms previous methods like raw attention, rollout, GradCAM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for localization, perturbations and rationales. The approach provides more consistent, class-dependent visualizations while addressing limitations of attention mechanisms alone.
