# [FoodFusion: A Latent Diffusion Model for Realistic Food Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03540)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces FoodFusion, a novel latent diffusion model tailored for realistic food image generation based on textual descriptions. The authors compiled an extensive food image dataset from multiple open sources, comprising over 335,000 images across 3,819 categories. To enhance data quality, they leveraged advanced techniques including prompt engineering with CLIP and segmentation with SAM to refine the image-caption pairs. Their method trains the latent diffusion model on this curated high-quality dataset. Experiments demonstrate FoodFusion's superior ability to generate diverse and realistic food images compared to existing publicly available models like Latent Diffusion and DALL-E Mini. The key innovations include the compilation of a large-scale high-quality food dataset, data cleaning procedures to align images with descriptions, and fine-tuning the latent diffusion model on this refined data to achieve state-of-the-art performance in food image synthesis. By open-sourcing the dataset and models, this work enables advancements in applications requiring authentic food imagery such as image-based dietary assessment.
