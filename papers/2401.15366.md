# [Face to Cartoon Incremental Super-Resolution using Knowledge   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Facial super-resolution using GANs has shown promise, but GANs have limited ability to adapt to new, unseen data. This is an issue in real-world applications where new facial data is continuously generated. 

- The paper aims to address this issue by exploring incremental learning to expand GANs capability for facial super-resolution to new datatypes, while retaining performance on old data.

Method:
- Proposes "Incremental Super-Resolution using Knowledge Distillation (ISR-KD)" framework. 

- Uses a GAN-based network pre-trained on CelebA face dataset as the starting point. The network is then incrementally trained on the iCartoonFace cartoon dataset using proposed method.

- Knowledge distillation is used - the pre-trained network's outputs are compared with the incrementally trained network's outputs on CelebA data. This retains performance on CelebA while improving on iCartoonFace.

- Additional losses like edge loss, adversarial loss, identity loss etc. are used alongside knowledge distillation loss.

Contributions:
- Proposes incremental learning for GAN-based face super-resolution to expand model's capability to new datatypes. 

- Uses knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

- Achieves improved performance on cartoon faces while retaining performance on real faces.

- Demonstrates effectiveness of knowledge distillation for incrementally expanding facial hallucination capability of GANs within a unified framework.

- The ability to incrementally adapt makes the method suitable for real-world applications where facial data distribution changes over time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an incremental super-resolution framework using GANs and knowledge distillation to incrementally adapt a facial super-resolution model trained on CelebA dataset to cartoon faces from iCartoonFace dataset while retaining performance on CelebA faces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an Incremental Super-Resolution technique using Knowledge Distillation (ISR-KD) for exploiting the existing knowledge for super-resolution on new types of images without training from scratch. 

2. The proposed model is originally developed and trained for face super-resolution and incrementally trained for cartoon face super-resolution.

3. The proposed model is able to improve the cartoon face super-resolution performance with negligible performance drop for original face super-resolution.

In summary, the key contribution is an incremental learning framework leveraging knowledge distillation to expand a facial super-resolution model to handle cartoon faces, while retaining performance on real faces. This allows adapting the model to new data without catastrophic forgetting.
