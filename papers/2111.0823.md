# [LSTA-Net: Long short-term Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for   Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.0823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is on developing an effective approach for skeleton-based action recognition that can model both long-range and short-range spatial-temporal dependencies in skeletal sequences. The main hypothesis is that explicitly capturing long-range dependencies in both the spatial and temporal dimensions is crucial for distinguishing different actions in skeleton sequences. However, prior methods rely heavily on predefined graph traversal rules or topologies, which are inadequate in modeling the complex relationships in real skeletal data lacking contextual information.To address this limitation, the paper proposes a novel long short-term feature aggregation strategy implemented through a factorized network architecture. The key ideas are:- Alternately perform spatial feature aggregation and temporal feature aggregation in a purely factorized manner, without relying on unified spatial-temporal operators like in prior works.- For spatial modeling, propose a multi-scale decentralized aggregation scheme to capture dependencies between distant joints. - For temporal modeling, propose an attention-enhanced temporal pyramid aggregation module to efficiently enlarge receptive fields and model long-range dynamics.- Further employ attention modules to enhance the aggregated spatial and temporal features.Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that this proposed approach can effectively capture both long and short range dependencies in space and time, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with high efficiency.In summary, the central hypothesis is that factorized spatial-temporal feature aggregation with explicit modeling of long-range dependencies is an effective and efficient approach for skeleton-based action recognition. The experiments aim to validate this idea.
