# [Improving Robustness for Joint Optimization of Camera Poses and   Decomposed Low-Rank Tensorial Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) represented as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) suffer from slow training and inference. Voxel-based methods accelerate this but still have high memory usage. Recently proposed decomposed low-rank tensor representation reduces memory usage but lacks robustness for jointly optimizing camera poses and scene geometry from only 2D supervision images.

Proposed Solution: 
- Conduct 1D analysis relating signal spectrum to convergence of gradient-based joint optimization, revealing need to control high frequencies.
- Propose efficient 3D filtering on decomposed tensor using separable component-wise convolution of Gaussian kernels. Allows controlling spectrum while retaining efficiency.
- Additional techniques like smoothed 2D supervision, randomly scaled kernels, and edge-guided losses further stabilize optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Provide theoretical insights showing importance of radiance field spectrum for joint optimization convergence.
- Algorithmically introduce separable component-wise convolution for efficient 3D filtering on decomposed tensors.
- Comprehensive evaluations show state-of-the-art quality and 4x faster convergence for joint optimization without known poses.

In summary, this paper identifies the impact of signal properties on joint pose and geometry optimization, and contributes an efficient spectral control method for decomposed tensor scene representations. Additional stabilization techniques are proposed to further enhance performance. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and rapid convergence for the joint optimization problem.
