# [CLAPSpeech: Learning Prosody from Text Context with Contrastive   Language-Audio Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10763)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we learn better text representations that capture prosodic information (e.g. pitch, duration) to improve expressive text-to-speech synthesis? The key ideas and contributions of the paper can be summarized as:- Proposes a cross-modal contrastive pre-training framework called CLAPSpeech to explicitly model the correlation between text context and prosody patterns. - Introduces a text encoder and prosody encoder trained with contrastive loss to connect text context with corresponding prosody extracted from speech.- Utilizes multi-scale pre-training to capture prosody at both word and phoneme levels. - Shows the pre-trained CLAPSpeech text encoder can be conveniently incorporated into existing TTS models like FastSpeech 2 and PortaSpeech to improve their prosody prediction.- Demonstrates improved performance over baselines on multiple datasets across languages and speakers. Analyzes model representations and performs ablation studies.In summary, the paper introduces a novel contrastive learning approach for learning text representations that are better at capturing prosodic information from context, which leads to more expressive speech synthesis when incorporated into existing TTS models. The method is analyzed extensively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing CLAPSpeech, a novel cross-modal contrastive pre-training framework for improving prosody modeling in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. CLAPSpeech is the first work to utilize cross-modal contrastive learning to explicitly model the correlation between text context and prosody patterns in speech. It trains a text encoder and a prosody encoder to connect the text context with its corresponding prosody in a joint embedding space. 2. It introduces a multi-scale pre-training framework to capture prosody patterns at both the phoneme and word levels.3. Experiments show CLAPSpeech can effectively improve prosody modeling and outperforms previous representation learning methods like BERT and A3T when incorporated into existing TTS systems. It generalizes well across languages (English and Chinese), speakers (single and multi-speaker), and TTS models (prediction-based and variation-based).4. Analysis shows CLAPSpeech learns text representations that are more sensitive to context changes compared to baselines. The text-speech joint space also enables intuitive prosody transfer applications.5. Ablation studies validate the importance of the model components like using byte-pair encoding features, multi-scale pre-training, and the contrastive learning objective.In summary, the core contribution is proposing a novel contrastive learning approach to explicitly model text context and prosody correlations for improving expressive TTS synthesis. The method is model-agnostic, generalizable, and outperforms previous representation learning techniques.
