# [CLAPSpeech: Learning Prosody from Text Context with Contrastive   Language-Audio Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10763)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we learn better text representations that capture prosodic information (e.g. pitch, duration) to improve expressive text-to-speech synthesis? The key ideas and contributions of the paper can be summarized as:- Proposes a cross-modal contrastive pre-training framework called CLAPSpeech to explicitly model the correlation between text context and prosody patterns. - Introduces a text encoder and prosody encoder trained with contrastive loss to connect text context with corresponding prosody extracted from speech.- Utilizes multi-scale pre-training to capture prosody at both word and phoneme levels. - Shows the pre-trained CLAPSpeech text encoder can be conveniently incorporated into existing TTS models like FastSpeech 2 and PortaSpeech to improve their prosody prediction.- Demonstrates improved performance over baselines on multiple datasets across languages and speakers. Analyzes model representations and performs ablation studies.In summary, the paper introduces a novel contrastive learning approach for learning text representations that are better at capturing prosodic information from context, which leads to more expressive speech synthesis when incorporated into existing TTS models. The method is analyzed extensively.
