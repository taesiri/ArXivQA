# [BlindDiff: Empowering Degradation Modelling in Diffusion Models for   Blind Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "BlindDiff: Empowering Degradation Modelling in Diffusion Models for Blind Image Super-Resolution":

Problem:
- Single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input. Most SISR methods assume a fixed degradation model (e.g. bicubic downsampling) and fail on real images with complex unknown degradations. 
- Blind SISR tackles this by jointly estimating the degradation (blur kernel) while super-resolving the image. However, existing blind SISR methods produce results with noticeable artifacts and low perceptual quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes BlindDiff, a diffusion model (DM) based blind SISR method. It formulates blind SISR as a MAP problem and unfolds the optimization into the DM's reverse process for alternate estimation of kernel and HR image.

- It proposes a modulated conditional transformer (MCFormer) network that provides generative priors on both data and kernels. MCFormer is trained with noise and kernel constraints to ensure these priors. 

- A kernel-aware gradient term is introduced between DM sampling steps to enforce degradation consistency and enable joint optimization of kernel and HR image in a closed loop. The kernel modulates image features for better degradation-aware representations.

Main Contributions:
- An effective and efficient DM-based framework BlindDiff for blind SISR by unfolding MAP optimization into the DM reverse process.

- A MCFormer network to provide generative priors on images and kernels within the DM workflow. It is trained with both noise and kernel constraints.

- The kernel-aware gradient term that bridges adjacent sampling steps for alternate estimation of kernel and HR image in a mutual reinforcing manner.

- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on blind SISR while being efficient in parameters and computations than existing DM methods. Evaluated extensively on synthetic and real datasets.
