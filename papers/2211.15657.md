# [Is Conditional Generative Modeling all you need for Decision-Making?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15657)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be whether conditional generative modeling (using diffusion models in particular) can be an effective tool for sequential decision-making tasks like offline reinforcement learning, constraint satisfaction, and skill composition. More specifically, some of the key hypotheses examined in the paper include:- Framing offline RL as conditional generative modeling of trajectories rather than dynamic programming can lead to effective policies without needing complex heuristics like in standard offline RL approaches.- Using classifier-free guidance and low-temperature sampling with diffusion models can serve as an implicit form of dynamic programming to extract good behaviors from the offline dataset.- Conditioning the generative model on different types of variables (returns, constraints, skills) allows flexibly generating behaviors at test time like maximizing rewards, satisfying constraints, and composing skills.So in summary, the main research question is assessing the potential of conditional generative modeling, especially diffusion models, as an alternative paradigm to standard reinforcement learning for decision-making across different settings. The key hypothesis is that this approach can be more effective and avoid some complexities of traditional RL methods.
