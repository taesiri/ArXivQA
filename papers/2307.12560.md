# [Interpolating between Images with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12560)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper introduces a method for generating high-quality interpolations between real images using pre-trained latent diffusion models. 

The key research questions/goals are:

- Can we leverage the capabilities of latent diffusion models (in particular, text conditioning and pose conditioning) to interpolate between real images in a zero-shot manner, without having to train or fine-tune a model?

- How should we perform the interpolation in latent space to generate smooth, creative transitions rather than simply alpha blending the input images?

- How can we guide the interpolation using information extracted from the input images, such as text embeddings and subject poses, to maintain consistency? 

- What metrics can effectively evaluate the quality of an image interpolation sequence?

So in summary, the central goal is developing an approach to interpolate between real images with large differences in style, content and pose, by making intelligent use of the conditioning mechanisms and inverted latent spaces provided by pre-trained latent diffusion models. The key technical components are the latent interpolation scheme, text inversion, pose guidance, and potentially CLIP-based candidate screening.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method for interpolating between real images using pre-trained latent diffusion models. The key ideas are:

- Performing interpolation in the latent space of a denoising diffusion model at different noise levels, rather than just interpolating the clean latents. This allows more flexibility to find smooth interpolations.

- Using textual inversion and pose estimation to extract relevant conditioning information from the input images. This information is interpolated and fed to the model during denoising to help guide the interpolation process. 

- Leveraging CLIP guidance to select the highest quality interpolation from multiple candidates.

The authors demonstrate that this approach can generate convincing interpolations between diverse image pairs with different subjects, styles, and layouts. They argue this will enable new creative applications compared to existing video interpolation and style transfer techniques.

Overall, the main contribution is proposing an end-to-end pipeline leveraging recent advances in diffusion models to enable high-quality interpolation of real images, a task which has not been previously demonstrated. The method is applied to a range of example image pairs to highlight its capabilities and limitations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a method for interpolating between real images using latent diffusion models. The key idea is to interpolate in the latent space at different noise levels, providing text embeddings and pose information as conditioning inputs. This allows generating smooth transitions between diverse images that differ in style, layout, and subject pose. The approach offers creative control via text prompts and CLIP ranking while requiring little hyperparameter tuning. Overall, the method enables high-quality image interpolations for creative applications in art, media, and design.

In one sentence: The paper proposes a technique to interpolate between real images with different styles/layouts using latent diffusion models conditioned on text and pose.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The key novel contribution is the proposed method for interpolating between real images using latent diffusion models. This has not been done before to my knowledge, as previous work focused more on interpolating between generated images or videos. 

- The approach of guiding the interpolation using textual inversion and pose estimation is clever, as it helps provide useful conditioning information to the model during the interpolation process. This allows better control over semantic changes between frames.

- Using CLIP to select the best interpolated frames is also an interesting idea. Leveraging CLIP as an automatic evaluator allows generating multiple options and picking the highest quality result.

- Compared to video interpolation papers, this work tackles a more unconstrained setting where style/content can change arbitrarily between frames rather than just motion/occlusions. The insights likely won't transfer directly.

- Compared to GAN interpolation papers, this method is more general as it can interpolate real images rather than just GAN-generated ones. The approach of adding noise before interpolating is somewhat similar though.

- For style transfer, this paper presents a different goal of gradual interpolation rather than a single output image. The techniques used are quite different as a result.

- Overall, this paper explores a novel and creative application of diffusion models. The design choices are reasonable but still demonstrate capability not shown before. The qualitative results look promising and highlight interesting future directions. Expanding this to video domains could be an exciting avenue for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential directions for future research:

- Developing better evaluation metrics for image interpolation quality. The authors note that standard metrics like FID and PPL do not adequately capture the quality of creative interpolations, as they penalize deviations from the original image distribution even if the interpolations look good qualitatively. More perceptually-aligned metrics are needed.

- Exploring non-uniform interpolation schedules that can produce smoother perceptual transitions between frames. The rate of stylistic changes in particular can vary a lot across the interpolation sequence. Allowing more user control over the interpolation schedule could help. 

- Improving the model's ability to handle large gaps in style, semantics, and layout between input images. The paper shows some failure cases where the model struggles to convincingly interpolate very different image pairs. More research is needed to bridge these challenging gaps.

- Combining interpolation with other image and video generation techniques like motion generation, segmentation, and bounding boxes for more control. The authors suggest interpolation could be readily integrated with these other methods.

- Deploying the method in creative tools and evaluating real-world usage, e.g. building an interpolation feature into Stable Diffusion. Studying how artists use interpolation in practice could reveal new directions.

In summary, the main suggestions are developing better evaluation metrics, allowing more user control over the interpolation process, improving performance on challenging image pairs, and integrating interpolation into full creative tools for further research and applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper: 

The paper introduces a method for interpolating between real images using pre-trained latent diffusion models. The key ideas are 1) interpolating in the latent space between two input images after adding noise, 2) conditioning the model on interpolated text embeddings derived from textual inversion and interpolated poses from OpenPose to guide the image generation process, and 3) using CLIP similarity scores to select the highest quality image from multiple candidates. The method is able to generate convincing interpolations between diverse image pairs spanning different subjects, styles, and layouts. Limitations are that it can fail on images with very different styles or semantics. The overall contribution is a flexible framework for high-quality image interpolation that can expand the creative applications of generative models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a method for interpolating between real images using latent diffusion models. The key idea is to leverage the conditioning capabilities of diffusion models to guide the interpolation process in latent space. Given two input images, the authors first encode them into latent vectors using a pre-trained encoder. They then add noise to these latent vectors and interpolate between them over multiple diffusion timesteps. To generate each intermediate frame, they interpolate the text embeddings and poses extracted from the input images to condition the diffusion model's denoising process. This helps ensure smooth transitions in style, content, and pose across the interpolation sequence. The authors compare various interpolation schemes and find that adding shared noise to the input latents before interpolating yields the most convincing results. They also show how ranking interpolated candidates with CLIP can further improve results. Qualitative experiments on a diverse image dataset demonstrate interpolations spanning changes in subject, style, and layout. Limitations include difficulty bridging large gaps in semantics or style between inputs. Overall, this work presents a simple yet effective approach for using latent diffusion models to interpolate real images in a zero-shot manner. Key innovations include using conditioned diffusion to guide interpolation and leveraging CLIP for candidate ranking.

In summary, this paper introduces an interpolation method for latent diffusion models to smoothly morph between real images that may differ significantly in content and style. The core ideas are to interpolate noisy latents and condition the diffusion model on interpolated text and pose to yield convincing intermediate frames. Experiments demonstrate creative interpolations spanning diverse domains and layouts. The proposed pipeline is readily deployable with existing pre-trained models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a method for interpolating between real images using pre-trained latent diffusion models. Given two input images, the pipeline first encodes them into latent vectors using the encoder of a latent diffusion model like Stable Diffusion. It then adds noise to these latents and interpolates between them to generate intermediate noisy latents. To convert these noisy latents into images, the pipeline extracts text embeddings and pose keypoints from the original inputs, interpolates these conditionings, and provides them along with the noisy latents to the denoising model to generate intermediate frames. This process can be iterated to interpolate latents at different noise levels in a branching structure. For higher quality results, the pipeline can generate multiple candidates using different noise samples and select the best using CLIP similarity scoring. The overall approach allows flexible interpolation between diverse image pairs in terms of content, style, and pose.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents a method for interpolating between real images using latent diffusion models. The key problems and questions it is addressing are:

- Image interpolation is an under-explored task, especially for real images with different styles/content. The paper argues this is a useful capability for creative applications.

- How can we smoothly interpolate in the latent space of diffusion models to transform one real image into another, while maintaining high image quality?

- How can we provide control over the interpolation process using text prompts, pose information, and CLIP guidance? 

- What are good quantitative evaluation metrics for interpolated image sequences? The paper argues that standard metrics like FID and PPL are insufficient.

In summary, the core problem is how to leverage the capabilities of latent diffusion models to perform high-quality interpolation between diverse real-world images, which is not handled well by prior work on latent space traversal, video frame interpolation, or style transfer. The key contributions are proposing interpolation techniques to address this problem, as well as analyzing the effect of different design choices and conditioning mechanisms.
