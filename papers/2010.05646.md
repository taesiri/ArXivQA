# [HiFi-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient and High   Fidelity Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) model that achieves both high computational efficiency and high fidelity audio quality for speech synthesis? 

The authors propose a new model called HiFi-GAN that aims to address this question. The key ideas are:

- Using a multi-period discriminator that looks at different periodic parts of the raw audio waveform to better capture the diverse periodic patterns in speech. 

- Using a multi-receptive field fusion module in the generator to observe audio patterns across different timescales in parallel.

- Additional loss functions like mel-spectrogram loss and feature matching loss to improve training stability and audio fidelity.

The hypothesis seems to be that by designing the discriminator and generator in these ways, HiFi-GAN can generate high quality speech audio efficiently compared to previous autoregressive or flow-based generative models. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis by evaluating HiFi-GAN against other models on metrics like audio quality, synthesis speed, and model size.

So in summary, the central research question is how to develop an efficient and high fidelity GAN architecture for speech synthesis, with the hypothesis that the proposed HiFi-GAN model can achieve this goal. The paper presents experiments to test this hypothesis.
