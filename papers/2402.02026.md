# [Multimodal-Enhanced Objectness Learner for Corner Case Detection in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02026)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing object detectors perform well in closed-set scenarios but struggle with open-world scenarios like corner cases in autonomous driving. Corner cases consist of novel instances of common classes (e.g. overturned truck) or instances of novel classes (e.g. traffic cone). Most detectors rely heavily on visual appearance cues seen during training, resulting in poor generalization and inability to detect novel objects.

Solution - MENOL:
The paper proposes a MultiModal-Enhanced Objectness Learner (MENOL)  to improve recall of novel classes using:

1) Geometry cues (depth, normal) to reduce discrepancy between known and novel classes and provide additional knowledge to learn notion of "objectness".

2) An objectness notion learner using vision-centric and image-text multimodal learning to better understand objectness. It uses deformable DETR + RoBERTa architecture.

3) A semi-supervised framework where objectness learner acts as teacher to generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled geometry images, infusing objectness knowledge into student model.

4) A DINO-based student model trained on pseudo-labeled geometry images combined with annotated RGB images to get the final open-world object detector.

Main Contributions:

- Provides a way to reduce discrepancy between known and novel classes to improve detection of corner cases 

- Multimodal objectness notion learner to learn the concept of "objectness"

- Semi-supervised framework to infuse objectness knowledge into student model

- Achieves 76.6% mAR-corner on CODA dataset, outperforming baselines by a large margin, showing ability to detect novel objects.

In summary, the paper presents an effective open-world object detection pipeline leveraging multiple modalities and semi-supervised learning to significantly improve recall on novel classes for corner case detection in autonomous driving.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal-enhanced objectness learner (MENOL) framework that uses vision-centric and image-text modalities in a semi-supervised learning approach to improve detection of corner cases in autonomous driving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel framework called MENOL (Multimodal-Enhanced Objectness Learner) for corner case detection in autonomous driving. Specifically:

- It proposes a multimodal-enhanced objectness notion learner and a semi-supervised learning framework to improve the recall of novel/corner case classes with lower training costs. This provides a general way to reduce the discrepancy between known and unknown classes.

- It utilizes both vision-centric (RGB, depth, normal images) and image-text modalities to provide additional knowledge and diverse information for the model to better learn the notion of objectness. 

- It shows that MENOL outperforms many public baselines, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art ORE method by 71.3% and 60.6% in terms of mAR-corner and mAR-agnostic metrics respectively on the CODA dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the MENOL framework that leverages multiple modalities and semi-supervised learning to effectively improve the detection of corner cases for autonomous driving.
