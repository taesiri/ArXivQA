# [Who is bragging more online? A large scale analysis of bragging in   social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Bragging is an important speech act to build positive self-image but can risk dislike if negatively perceived. Prior work has only qualitatively studied bragging behavior for specific contexts and small datasets. This paper aims to provide the first large-scale quantitative analysis of bragging prevalence and dynamics on social media over time and across user groups.

Methods:
- Collected 1M+ English tweets from 2,685 Twitter users in the US over 10 years along with user traits like gender, age, education, income. 
- Identified bragging tweets using a state-of-the-art neural classifier with 78.55 F1. 
- Computed user-level bragging prevalence scores normalized over time.
- Correlated bragging scores with user traits and popularity metrics like followers. 
- Analyzed differences in linguistic expressions of bragging across user groups.

Key Findings:
- Bragging percentage steadily decreases over the 10 years within the same group of users.
- Females, younger users, higher educated and higher income users brag more. Popular users also brag more.
- Male users brag more about leisure activities while females focus more on themselves. Older and educated users involve others when bragging.
- Younger users and females use more emojis while bragging.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale quantitative analysis of bragging dynamics and prevalence on social media
- Analysis of impact of gender, age, education, income and popularity on bragging
- Uncovering distinctions in bragging language across different user groups over time

The paper provides a comprehensive computational analysis of an important social phenomenon at scale. The temporal dynamics, correlations with user traits and linguistic expressions reveal new insights about bragging behavior on social platforms.
