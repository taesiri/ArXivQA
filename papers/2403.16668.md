# [Who is bragging more online? A large scale analysis of bragging in   social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Bragging is an important speech act to build positive self-image but can risk dislike if negatively perceived. Prior work has only qualitatively studied bragging behavior for specific contexts and small datasets. This paper aims to provide the first large-scale quantitative analysis of bragging prevalence and dynamics on social media over time and across user groups.

Methods:
- Collected 1M+ English tweets from 2,685 Twitter users in the US over 10 years along with user traits like gender, age, education, income. 
- Identified bragging tweets using a state-of-the-art neural classifier with 78.55 F1. 
- Computed user-level bragging prevalence scores normalized over time.
- Correlated bragging scores with user traits and popularity metrics like followers. 
- Analyzed differences in linguistic expressions of bragging across user groups.

Key Findings:
- Bragging percentage steadily decreases over the 10 years within the same group of users.
- Females, younger users, higher educated and higher income users brag more. Popular users also brag more.
- Male users brag more about leisure activities while females focus more on themselves. Older and educated users involve others when bragging.
- Younger users and females use more emojis while bragging.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale quantitative analysis of bragging dynamics and prevalence on social media
- Analysis of impact of gender, age, education, income and popularity on bragging
- Uncovering distinctions in bragging language across different user groups over time

The paper provides a comprehensive computational analysis of an important social phenomenon at scale. The temporal dynamics, correlations with user traits and linguistic expressions reveal new insights about bragging behavior on social platforms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the first large-scale quantitative study of bragging behavior on social media, analyzing over 1 million English tweets to understand bragging prevalence, temporal dynamics, and correlations with user traits like gender, age, education, income, and popularity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Providing the first large scale quantitative study on the prevalence of online bragging using a longitudinal data set that includes over 1 million English tweets posted by a group of 2,685 Twitter users in the U.S. over ten years. The study identifies bragging through Natural Language Processing methods and focuses on analyzing its overall prevalence, temporal dynamics and impact of demographic factors.

Key findings include:
- Bragging steadily decreases over time within the same group of users over the 10 year period. 
- Bragging is more prevalent among users who are female, younger, more educated, have a higher income and are more popular on Twitter.
- Differences in bragging language and topics based on gender, age, education and income levels. For example, male users brag more about leisure while female users focus more on themselves.

So in summary, the main contribution is conducting the first computational study to quantify bragging behavior at scale along with an analysis of how it differs across user groups.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Bragging - The main focus of the paper is studying bragging behavior in social media.

- Social media - The paper specifically looks at bragging behavior on the Twitter platform. 

- Computational sociolinguistics - The methods used in the paper fall under the field of computational sociolinguistics.

- Prevalence - A major research question is studying the overall prevalence of bragging on Twitter over time.

- User traits - The paper examines how various user traits like gender, age, education, income, and popularity correlate with bragging behavior. 

- Longitudinal analysis - The study uses a longitudinal Twitter dataset spanning 10 years to analyze temporal bragging dynamics.

- Linguistic analysis - Linguistic methods are used to identify topics and patterns associated with bragging by different user groups.

- Normalization - A time normalization method is used to account for changing base rates of bragging over time.

- Self-presentation - The paper connects bragging to broader theories of online self-presentation.

So in summary, the key terms cover bragging, social media analysis, computational sociolinguistics methods, user traits, longitudinal analysis, linguistics, and self-presentation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses a bragging classifier to identify bragging tweets. What details are provided about the performance of this classifier on the analysis dataset? How does this compare to the reported performance on the test set from the original paper that proposed the classifier?

2. The paper normalizes the user-level bragging ratio by the overall bragging prevalence over time. What is the rationale behind this time normalization? How could not doing this impact the analysis?  

3. For the linguistic analysis of topics associated with bragging, the paper uses a univariate correlation method. What are some limitations of this method? What other linguistic analysis methods could provide a more nuanced understanding of differences in bragging language?

4. In the analysis of bragging prevalence across demographics, what confounding variables could impact the observed correlations between traits like gender, age etc. and bragging? How does the paper try to control for some of these variables?

5. The paper finds an inverse relationship between age and bragging but positive relationships between education, income and bragging. What explanations are provided for these opposing trends? How could this be analyzed further?  

6. For the analysis across gender, the paper concludes women use more emojis while bragging. But could this also be related to age, since the paper finds younger users also use more emojis? How could the interplay between multiple attributes be studied?

7. The paper studies the relationship between user popularity traits like follower counts and bragging. But how reliable are these popularity indicators in determining the actual size of the target audience? What other metrics could also be indicative of audience size?

8. Most of the analysis looks at aggregate correlation trends across thousands of users. What methodology could be used to do an in-depth qualitative analysis of differences in bragging language across individual users with varying attributes?

9. The language analysis relies on univariate correlation between unigrams and bragging. What other more complex linguistic constructs like topics, frames etc. could reveal insights related to bragging behavior differences across user groups?

10. The paper studies bragging behavior exclusively on Twitter. What other social media platforms could this analysis be expanded to and how could we expect bragging behavior to differ across platforms?
