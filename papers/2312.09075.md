# [Towards Verifiable Text Generation with Evolving Memory and   Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09075)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces VTG, a novel framework for verifiable text generation using large language models (LLMs). VTG addresses several key challenges in generating accurate, well-cited text: (1) focus shifting during long text generation, (2) balancing precision and scope during document retrieval, and (3) discerning complex relationships between claims and citations. 

To address these challenges, VTG utilizes an evolving long short-term memory to retain both valuable past documents and up-to-date documents. It enhances precision and scope in retrieval through active retrieval and diverse query generation. Moreover, it enables reflection on claim-citation relationships through a two-tier verifier and evidence finder.  

Extensive experiments were conducted on five datasets across three knowledge-intensive tasks. The results demonstrate that VTG significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both citation quality and answer correctness. Analytical experiments also verified the efficacy of VTG's components and parameters.

In summary, VTG provides an effective approach to high-quality, verifiable text generation through its use of evolving memory, active retrieval, diverse queries, two-tier verification, and self-reflection.
