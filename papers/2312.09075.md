# [Towards Verifiable Text Generation with Evolving Memory and   Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) face challenges with generating inaccurate, hallucinated outputs. An effective solution is to enable LLMs to provide citations to verify the factual correctness of their outputs, known as verifiable text generation.

- However, verifiable text generation is difficult due to three key issues: (1) The focus of the generated text shifts over time, requiring dynamic support from documents, (2) There is a precision vs scope tradeoff in retrieving documents - precise retrieval reduces noise but limits scope while expansive retrieval improves scope but introduces noise (3) Determining if a citation supports a claim requires nuanced reasoning about their relationship.

Proposed Solution - VTG:
- The paper proposes VTG, a framework for verifiable text generation using evolving memory and self-reflection. 

- VTG maintains an evolving long-short term memory to store valuable past documents and recent documents. This handles the focus shifting issue.

- It uses active retrieval and diverse query generation to enhance both precision and scope of document retrieval, addressing the retrieval tradeoff.

- It employs a two-tier verifier and evidence finder to re-examine and reflect on the relationship between claims and citations, enabling nuanced reasoning.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces VTG, an innovative approach combining long short-term memory and two-tier verification for verifiable text generation.

- Evolving memory effectively retains valuable and recent documents, addressing focus shifts. Active retrieval and diverse queries improve retrieval precision and scope.

- Two-tier verifier and evidence finder facilitate nuanced reasoning about the claim-citation relationships.

- Experiments on 5 datasets and 3 tasks demonstrate VTG substantially improves over strong baselines in citation quality and answering correctness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VTG, a framework for verifiable text generation that uses evolving long and short-term memory to retain valuable and up-to-date documents, active retrieval and diverse query generation to enhance precision and scope, and a two-tier verifier with an evidence finder to enable reflection on the relationship between claims and citations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces VTG, a unified framework that guides the generation model using a combination of long short-term memory and a two-tier verifier, providing a self-reflective and nuanced approach for verifiable text generation.

2. The implementation of long short-term memory effectively captures the most valuable and up-to-date documents, significantly addressing the focus-shifting issue. The active retrieval mechanism and integration of diverse query generation increase both the precision and scope of the retrieved documents.

3. The two-tier verifier and evidence finder enable in-depth analysis of the relationship between generated sentences and potential evidence.  

4. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three knowledge-intensive tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing VTG, an innovative verifiable text generation approach with evolving memory and self-reflection capabilities. VTG addresses major challenges in this task through its memory system, retrieval mechanisms, and verification components. Experiments demonstrate VTG's superior performance over existing methods.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions an "evolving long short-term memory system" to address the focus-shifting issue in verifiable text generation. Can you explain in more detail how this memory system works and how it helps with focus-shifting? 

2. The paper talks about active retrieval and diverse query generation to enhance both precision and scope of retrieved documents. What specific techniques are used for active retrieval and diverse query generation? How do they balance precision and scope?

3. What is the rationale behind having separate sentence generation and citation generation modules? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this divided approach?

4. Can you explain the workings of the two-tier verifier in more depth? What are the differences in the verification logic used by the generation verifier and memory verifier?

5. How exactly does the evidence finder module generate queries in a context-aware manner? What information is integrated from the context when formulating these queries?

6. The paper mentions iterative generation and verification as an attempt to emulate human-like composition of text with citations. In what specific ways does the proposed method mimic human behavior in this task?

7. What modifications could be made to the citation simplifier to further refine the citations and remove different types of unnecessary references? 

8. The paper analyzes the impact of various hyper-parameters. What other hyper-parameters could be explored to further optimize the model?
