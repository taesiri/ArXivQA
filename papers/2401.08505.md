# [Harnessing Orthogonality to Train Low-Rank Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks have a large number of parameters, making them computationally expensive to train and deploy. Reducing the number of parameters without compromising accuracy is an important research goal.
- The learning dynamics and intrinsic structure of neural networks are not well understood, limiting techniques to compress them.

Methodology:
- Analyzed the singular value decomposition (SVD) of neural network weights during training. 
- Observed that the orthogonal bases of the weights, captured in the SVD, stabilize after initial training epochs across various network architectures.
- Proposed a novel Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training technique that:
   - Starts training in full-rank form
   - Transitions weights to SVD-based low-rank form after delay period
   - Freezes orthogonal bases, only updates singular values
   - Adaptively reduces rank by removing insignificant singular values

Contributions:
- Provides evidence that neural network weights develop an intrinsic orthogonal structure during training
- Introduces OIALR training to exploit this, seamlessly integrating into normal workflows
- Shows OIALR reduces parameters by upto 90% with minimal accuracy loss across datasets, models and tasks
- Matches or improves accuracy and training time over baseline with proper hyperparameter tuning
- Enables model compression and efficient fine-tuning for resource-constrained deployment

The key insight is that neural network weights learn an orthogonal coordinate system/basis during initial training. By freezing this basis later and adaptively reducing singular values, OIALR greatly reduces parameters without losing model expressivity. When tuned appropriately, significant improvements are achieved.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel neural network training method called Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training that exploits the stabilization of orthogonal bases in network weights during training to significantly reduce the number of parameters with minimal impact on accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training, a novel training method that exploits the intrinsic orthogonality of neural networks to reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, the paper:

- Shows evidence that the orthogonal bases of a network's weights stabilize during training.

- Proposes the OIALR training method which transitions weights to their SVD representation midway through training and only trains the singular values while freezing the orthogonal bases. The bases are periodically updated and pruned.

- Demonstrates through experiments on image classification and time series forecasting tasks that OIALR can seamlessly integrate into existing training workflows and match or exceed the performance of full-rank models while requiring far fewer trainable parameters.

- Shows when properly tuned, OIALR can outperform both full-rank training and other low-rank methods in terms of accuracy and training time.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and experimental validation of the OIALR training method that exploits weight orthogonality to train compact yet accurate neural network models.

The paper introduces a novel training method called OIALR that exploits the intrinsic orthogonality that stabilizes in neural networks during training. It uses singular value decomposition to decompose the weight matrices into orthogonal bases, singular values, and cobases. By only training the singular values after a certain point, it can reduce the number of trainable parameters in the network while maintaining accuracy. Key ideas explored are low-rank approximations, model compression, parameter efficiency, basis vector stability, and harnessing intrinsic orthogonality. The method is benchmarked on various datasets and neural network architectures. When properly tuned, OIALR can outperform conventional training methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called "Stability" to measure the change in a weight matrix's orthogonal bases during training. How is this metric calculated and what does a higher or lower stability value indicate about the evolution of the bases? 

2. The Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training method transitions weights to their SVD representation after a delay period $d$. How is this delay period determined and what impact could it have on the training dynamics if set incorrectly?

3. When updating the U and V bases during OIALR training, singular values below a threshold $\beta$ times the maximum singular value are discarded. What is the rationale behind this thresholding approach and how sensitive are the results to the choice of $\beta$? 

4. The paper mentions using compact SVD instead of regular SVD. What is the difference between compact and regular SVD and why might compact SVD be preferred in the context of OIALR?

5. The learning rate schedule discovered via hyperparameter optimization for OIALR training on CIFAR-10 increases as the number of parameters decreases. Why does this make intuitive sense and how might it impact training dynamics?

6. While OIALR training worked well for Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers, what types of neural network architectures might it struggle with and why?

7. The paper demonstrates OIALR on computer vision and time series forecasting tasks. What other data modalities or tasks could benefit from orthogonality-informed training approaches?

8. How does the stabilization of the orthogonal bases enable compression of neural networks? What is lacking in our understanding that prevents even higher compression rates?  

9. Could the stabilization of orthogonal bases during training be leveraged to improve transfer learning or continual learning approaches? If so, how?

10. The authors use identical hyperparameters for baseline and OIALR training in some experiments. What modifications to optimization hyperparams could further improve results for OIALR?
