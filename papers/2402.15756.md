# [Detection Is Tracking: Point Cloud Multi-Sweep Deep Learning Models   Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In autonomous driving, lidar point clouds are passed through a deep learning "virtual sensor" to produce detections like bounding boxes. Often multiple lidar sweeps are accumulated as input to improve performance.
- However, the input contains temporal information but the output detections only correspond to the end time of the input buffer. The paper argues this lacks symmetry and temporal information in the outputs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents a deep learning model called MULSPAD that produces "paired detections" - two bounding boxes for each detected object at both the end and start times of the multi-sweep input lidar buffer.

- This is achieved by fairly straightforward modifications to existing lidar detection models like adding another processing stage and regression heads.

- The paired detections aim to add temporal information and symmetry, enabling easier tracking and more robust trackers.

Key Contributions:

- New perspective that output of multi-sweep detection model should also contain temporal information for symmetry.  

- Concept of paired detections at both ends of input lidar sweep buffer, enabled by minor changes to existing detection models.

- Showing paired detections can construct basic trackers easily and enable more sophisticated trackers to be more robust against choice of motion/birth-death models.

- Proof-of-concept model MULSPAD built on VoxelNeXT detector that produces paired detections using Waymo Open Dataset.

- Demonstrates efficacy of proposed approach - simpler and more robust detection & tracking, without much extra computation.

In summary, the key insight is that temporal nature of multi-sweep lidar input should lead to temporal information in outputs, achieved neatly via paired detections from barely-modified detectors. This promises simpler and better performing perception pipelines.
