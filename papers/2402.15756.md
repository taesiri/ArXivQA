# [Detection Is Tracking: Point Cloud Multi-Sweep Deep Learning Models   Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In autonomous driving, lidar point clouds are passed through a deep learning "virtual sensor" to produce detections like bounding boxes. Often multiple lidar sweeps are accumulated as input to improve performance.
- However, the input contains temporal information but the output detections only correspond to the end time of the input buffer. The paper argues this lacks symmetry and temporal information in the outputs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents a deep learning model called MULSPAD that produces "paired detections" - two bounding boxes for each detected object at both the end and start times of the multi-sweep input lidar buffer.

- This is achieved by fairly straightforward modifications to existing lidar detection models like adding another processing stage and regression heads.

- The paired detections aim to add temporal information and symmetry, enabling easier tracking and more robust trackers.

Key Contributions:

- New perspective that output of multi-sweep detection model should also contain temporal information for symmetry.  

- Concept of paired detections at both ends of input lidar sweep buffer, enabled by minor changes to existing detection models.

- Showing paired detections can construct basic trackers easily and enable more sophisticated trackers to be more robust against choice of motion/birth-death models.

- Proof-of-concept model MULSPAD built on VoxelNeXT detector that produces paired detections using Waymo Open Dataset.

- Demonstrates efficacy of proposed approach - simpler and more robust detection & tracking, without much extra computation.

In summary, the key insight is that temporal nature of multi-sweep lidar input should lead to temporal information in outputs, achieved neatly via paired detections from barely-modified detectors. This promises simpler and better performing perception pipelines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep learning model called MULSPAD that takes multi-sweep lidar input and produces paired detections, i.e. bounding boxes at both the current time and a past time, for each detected object, arguing that such temporal symmetry in the output matches the temporal nature of the multi-sweep input and can benefit detection and tracking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new deep learning model called MULSPAD (MULti-Sweep PAired Detector) that produces paired detections for each object from multi-sweep lidar input. Specifically:

- MULSPAD outputs, for each detected object, a pair of bounding boxes - one for the current time and one for a past time corresponding to the beginning of the multi-sweep lidar input buffer. This provides temporal information about where the object is and where it was.

- Getting these paired detections only requires fairly straightforward modifications to existing multi-sweep lidar detection models like VoxelNeXT. It adds symmetry and enriches the information passed to the tracking module.

- The paired detections can enable building simple tracking heuristics and also make the design of more sophisticated trackers more robust. Preliminary experiments on Waymo data confirm the efficacy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and realizing a new way of producing paired object detections from multi-sweep lidar input to facilitate tracking, via the new model MULSPAD.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that with multi-sweep lidar input, the detection output should also contain temporal information in the form of paired bounding boxes. What is the intuition behind this argument? How does it conceptually differ from existing methods?

2. The paper proposes MULSPAD which produces paired detections. Explain in detail the architecture and key components of MULSPAD. How does it differ from/build upon VoxelNeXT and CenterPoint? 

3. The definition of the begin time $t_b$ and end time $t_e$ for ground truth tracks seems non-trivial considering various boundary cases like object birth/death etc. Elaborate this process and discuss any potential complications.  

4. The paper claims paired detections can make tracking more robust. Substantiate this claim. How exactly can the extra temporal information be exploited by trackers? Discuss with examples.

5. Explain the RFS tracker used as a baseline in the paper. How is the special case with a hypothesis budget of 1 related to greedy assignment? Elaborate with visuals.  

6. The paper employs some likelihood models for tracking. Explain these models, the intuition and assumptions behind them. How are they designed differently for static/slow and fast moving objects?

7. The lateral deviation model uses the max of $|BB'|$ and $|CC'|$. Why is the max operation used here instead of mean or sum? What insight does this provide about the model?

8. One ablation study that can be done is using single sweep detection instead of MULSPAD. Speculate what degradation you might expect in tracking performance and why.

9. The paper demonstrates tracking results on Waymo dataset qualitatively. What quantitative tracking metrics could be used to evaluate performance more rigorously?

10. The paper claims only marginal extra computation for MULSPAD over single sweep detection. Provide a detailed analysis to substantiate or counter this claim.
