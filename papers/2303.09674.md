# [DiGeo: Discriminative Geometry-Aware Learning for Generalized Few-Shot   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09674)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we improve generalized few-shot object detection by learning more discriminative features that achieve both inter-class separation and intra-class compactness?

The key hypothesis is that by explicitly encouraging the feature representations to have these properties of discrimination, the model can better generalize to detecting both base classes (with abundant training data) and novel classes (with limited data). 

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called DiGeo that:

- Uses an offline simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier to derive fixed class centers that are maximally and equally separated, guiding inter-class separation. 

- Includes adaptive class-specific margins in the classification loss to encourage intra-class feature compactness around the class centers.

- Learns the margins via self-distillation based on the training instance distribution priors.

The goal is to improve few-shot detection performance on novel classes without hurting base class detection, by improving the overall discriminative ability of the learned feature representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets are used to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new training framework called DiGeo (Discriminative Geometry-aware learning) for generalized few-shot object detection. The key ideas are:

- Pointing out that insufficient discriminative feature learning is a reason for the trade-off between base class and novel class performance in existing methods. 

- Learning features with inter-class separation and intra-class compactness to improve discrimination. This is done by:

1) Deriving an offline simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier with maximally and equally separated weights as class centers. 

2) Adding adaptive class-specific margins into the classification loss to encourage compact clusters close to the centers.

- Initializing and adjusting the margins via self-distillation from the prior training instance distribution due to class imbalance.

The proposed DiGeo framework improves generalization on novel classes without hurting base class detection on few-shot detection benchmarks. It also extends to long-tail detection.
