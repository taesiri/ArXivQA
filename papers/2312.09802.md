# [Concept Prerequisite Relation Prediction by Using   Permutation-Equivariant Directed Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of concept prerequisite relation prediction (CPRP), which aims to predict prerequisite relations between knowledge concepts (KCs) in education. CPRP helps in applications like learning path planning and material recommendation. It is typically formulated as a link prediction task on a directed graph of KCs. However, existing directed graph neural networks (GNNs) used for this task have limited ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, reducing the expressiveness of learned representations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a permutation-equivariant directed GNN for CPRP based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Specifically:

1. KC embeddings are obtained from BERT based on concept textual descriptions. A directed KC graph is constructed.

2. A novel WL test-guided directed GNN is designed to learn KC representations by: (a) Redefining k-tuples to fit directed graphs; (b) Constructing multiple graphs to capture different neighbor relationships; (c) Fusing information from different graphs using MLP; (d) Reallocating k-tuple representations back to nodes.  

3. A Siamese network takes KC representations and predicts the probability of a prerequisite relation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first WL test-based directed GNN to improve expressiveness for CPRP by distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous methods like ConLearn, CPRL and GAE/VGAE.

- Provides a novel permutation-equivariant framework for directed graphs that can be applied to other tasks involving directed networks.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in enhancing directed GNNs for concept prerequisite prediction through an innovative integration of the WL test. Both methodology and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed techniques.
