# [Belief Change based on Knowledge Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of quantitatively modeling belief change operations such as contraction, expansion and revision. Belief change deals with incorporating new information into a knowledge base while preserving consistency. Existing approaches like the AGM framework provide a set of qualitative postulates that belief change operators should satisfy, but lack a quantitative modeling. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using Knowledge Measures (KMs) to quantitatively model belief change operators. KMs aim to quantify the amount of knowledge/information in a knowledge base. The paper first generalizes KMs to probabilistic settings based on information theory. It then defines KM-based contraction, expansion and revision operators that try to minimize the information-theoretic surprise of the changed belief. Specifically:

- Contraction removes sentences from a belief while preserving consistency. The KM-contraction operator selects the most probable remainders that don't entail the contracted sentence.

- Expansion incorporates new sentences without removing existing ones. 

- Revision incorporates new sentences while removing others if needed to preserve consistency. KM-revision combines KM-contraction and expansion using the Levi identity.

The paper shows these operators satisfy standard AGM postulates. It also shows any operator satisfying AGM postulates can be represented as a KM-based operator regulated by a suitable probability distribution.

Main Contributions:

- An information-theoretic generalization of KMs beyond uniform distributions

- KM-based quantitative modeling of contraction, expansion and revision operators that adhere to AGM postulates

- Representation theorem: any AGM compliant operator can be expressed as a KM-based operator

- Quantitative measures of information loss, gain and change for the respective operators

Additionally, the paper looks briefly into iterated revision, and building a non-recovery compliant contraction operator within the KM framework.

In summary, the paper provides a novel quantitative perspective on modeling belief change grounded in information theory and knowledge measures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces knowledge measure-based belief change operators for propositional logic that satisfy the AGM postulates and shows that any belief change operator satisfying the AGM postulates can be represented as a knowledge measure-based operator defined in terms of minimizing information theoretic surprise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to knowledge measures and belief change:

1. It presents a general information theoretic approach to knowledge measures, with Straccia's previous work being a special case. 

2. It proposes knowledge measure-based belief change operators for contraction, expansion, and revision that satisfy the AGM postulates.

3. It shows that any belief change operator satisfying the AGM postulates can be represented as a knowledge measure-based operator, regulated by a specific probability distribution over possible worlds.

4. It introduces quantitative measures for information loss during contraction, information gain during expansion, and information change during revision.

5. It gives a preliminary investigation into iterated belief revision using knowledge measures and shows that some but not all of the standard postulates are satisfied.  

6. It illustrates how to build a non-recovery postulate compliant contraction operator from the knowledge measure-based framework, using severe withdrawal as an example.

In summary, the main contribution is a quantitative belief change framework based on knowledge measures that provides representations for all AGM compliant operators and ways to measure information change.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Knowledge measures (KMs) - methods for quantifying the amount of knowledge or information in a knowledge base
- Belief change - processes for changing the beliefs in a knowledge base when new information is acquired
- Contraction - removing information from a knowledge base
- Expansion - adding information to a knowledge base 
- Revision - adding new information to a knowledge base while removing conflicting information
- AGM postulates - principles that belief change operators should satisfy
- Iterated belief revision - applying sequences of revision operations
- Information loss - quantifying how much information is lost during contraction
- Information gain - quantifying new information added during expansion
- Information change - quantifying net change during revision
- Principle of minimal surprise - preference for least surprising/most probable options in belief change
- Knowledge-measure based operators - belief change operators defined using knowledge measures
- Representation theorems - showing equivalence classes of operators satisfying sets of postulates

The key focus areas are knowledge measures, AGM belief change postulates, and using knowledge measures to define quantitative belief change operators.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the knowledge measure based belief change method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the principle of minimal surprise relate to other principles like the principle of indifference and informational economy? What are the key differences in how they guide the belief change process?

2) The knowledge measures introduced satisfy axioms like additivity. What would be the effect of relaxing some of these axioms? Can useful alternatives still be defined?

3) The contraction operator is defined based on a minimization over the remainders. What if a maximization was used instead? Would that lead to a useful variant of the operator?

4) What are the computational complexity implications of using the proposed knowledge measure based operators? How do they compare with traditional AGM operators?

5) The framework allows different probability distributions to determine different contraction operators. What guidance exists on selecting an appropriate distribution for a given scenario? 

6) How sensitive are the proposed operators to small changes in the underlying probability distribution? Is there a notion of continuity that can be formally defined and studied?

7) The treatment of iterated revision shows some postulates do not hold. Can the framework be extended in a principled manner to better address iterated belief change?

8) The severe withdrawal operator loses more information than regular contraction. Can this concept of information loss be further formalized to study withdrawal versus contraction?

9) The use of knowledge measures facilitates numeric measures of information loss and gain. How can these effectively guide an agent in managing its beliefs?

10) The framework focuses on propositional logic. What are the chief challenges in extending it to first-order logic or other more expressive logics?
