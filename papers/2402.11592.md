# [Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM   Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, fine-tuning them using first-order (FO) optimizers like SGD and Adam incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need for backpropagation (BP). This memory inefficiency poses challenges especially for applications like on-device training where memory is limited.  

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes using BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods as a solution to reduce memory costs during LLM fine-tuning. The initial concept was introduced in Malladi et al. (2024), which employs ZO stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). This paper conducts the first comprehensive benchmark study to explore a broader range of ZO optimization techniques for LLM fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:

- Creates the first benchmark for evaluating various ZO optimization methods for LLM fine-tuning, covering 5 LLM families, 3 task complexities, and 5 fine-tuning schemes.

- Reveals previously overlooked principles about ZO optimization for LLM fine-tuning, including the importance of task alignment, the role of forward gradient as a competitive baseline, and the tradeoffs between algorithm complexity, accuracy and efficiency.  

- Proposes techniques to further advance ZO optimization for LLM fine-tuning: (i) block-wise ZO optimization to reduce variance; (ii) hybrid ZO and FO training to balance performance and memory; (iii) sparsity-induced ZO optimization to improve accuracy.

- The proposed enhancements to incorporate ZO optimization provides pathways to achieve further memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning without compromising accuracy. The benchmark and optimization insights lay groundwork to facilitate adoption of ZO methods.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores using block-wise zeroth-order optimization to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. How does splitting the model into blocks and estimating the gradients block-wise specifically help mitigate the high variance issue of zeroth-order methods? What are the tradeoffs in terms of computation cost?

2. The paper proposes a hybrid first-order and zeroth-order training approach. What is the intuition behind using first-order methods on the deeper layers and zeroth-order methods on the shallower layers? How does this approach balance performance and memory efficiency? 

3. Sparsity-induced zeroth-order optimization is introduced in the paper to further improve accuracy. What types of sparsity patterns were explored? How does introducing sparsity in the gradient estimate potentially improve performance and what are the limitations?

4. The paper benchmarks performance across multiple model architectures, including RoBERTa, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, and Mistral. What architectural differences between these models have the biggest impact on the relative performance of zeroth-order versus first-order methods?

5. What specific types of tasks or datasets lead to the biggest gaps in performance between first-order and zeroth-order methods? Are there certain complexity or length thresholds that zeroth-order struggles with in practice? 

6. The paper argues that task alignment plays a crucial role in effectively applying zeroth-order methods. What specifically about task alignment helps mitigate issues with zeroth-order optimization? Are there ways to improve alignment?

7. Among the zeroth-order algorithms explored, which ones tend to perform the best in terms of balancing accuracy and efficiency? Are there clear stability or convergence differences between the methods?

8. The forward gradient method is introduced as a competitive baseline to other zeroth-order approaches. What are its advantages and disadvantages compared to classic zeroth-order estimators? When does it tend to outperform other options?

9. For real-world deployment, what are the practical bottlenecks of using zeroth-order methods instead of typical first-order techniques? Are there any caveats around convergence, hyperparameter tuning, etc?

10. The paper focuses on natural language processing tasks. Would the proposed zeroth-order methods be expected to have similar advantages for other modalities such as computer vision? What differences might be anticipated?
