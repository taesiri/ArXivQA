# [Instant3D: Instant Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08403)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes Instant3D, a novel framework for fast text-to-3D generation that can create a 3D object from an unseen text prompt in less than one second using a single feedforward network.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Instant3D for fast text-to-3D generation. It generates 3D objects from text prompts in a feedforward manner, taking less than one second. This is much faster than existing methods which optimize neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from scratch for each prompt, taking hours. The key innovation is a neural network that directly maps text to a 3D triplane representation. To effectively incorporate the text condition, it combines three techniques: cross-attention, style injection, and token-to-plane transformation. It also proposes a scaled-sigmoid activation to speed up training convergence. To reduce the multi-head effect, an adaptive Perp-Neg algorithm is presented to dynamically adjust concept negation scales based on the severity of the problem. Experiments on various benchmarks show the method generates high-quality 3D objects consistent with novel text prompts orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. The efficiency enables practical text-to-3D applications.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Instant3D for fast text-to-3D generation. Existing methods rely on time-consuming optimization to generate a 3D object from scratch for each text prompt, taking hours per object. In contrast, Instant3D is a feedforward network that can generate a 3D object from a new text prompt in under a second. The key innovation is a decoder network that transforms the text embedding into a 3D triplane representation. To effectively inject the text condition into the network under weak supervision from the score distillation sampling loss, the authors propose integrating cross-attention, style injection, and token-to-plane transformation modules. Additionally, they introduce a scaled-sigmoid activation function that accelerates training convergence by over 10x compared to standard sigmoid. To tackle the Janus (multi-head) problem, they present an adaptive Perp-Neg algorithm that dynamically adjusts concept negation scales based on the severity of the issue. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate Instant3D generates higher quality 3D objects more efficiently than state-of-the-art methods. The work represents an important step towards practical text-to-3D systems.
