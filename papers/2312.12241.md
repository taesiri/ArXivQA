# [GeomVerse: A Systematic Evaluation of Large Models for Geometric   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical reasoning is an important capability for AI systems, but most existing datasets focus on textual problems. Many mathematical problems contain both text and images, especially geometry questions which are common in math competitions and curriculum. 
- General vision-language models (VLMs) have not been systematically evaluated on their ability to perform multi-modal, multi-hop mathematical reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a synthetic dataset called GeomVerse of geometry questions with controllable levels of reasoning difficulty along multiple axes (depth, width, distractors, etc).
- The geometry questions and solutions are automatically generated by making analogies to logical theories and using a backward chaining procedure. 
- They systematically evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs on GeomVerse by finetuning the models and analyzing their reasoning performance.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the first large-scale synthetic benchmark for evaluating visual and textual reasoning of VLMs on geometry problems.
- Systematic analysis reveals limitations of current VLMs in multi-modal, multi-hop reasoning - performance significantly drops with depth rather than width, and does not generalize well to new shapes.
- Finetuning on the synthetic dataset improves performance on real geometry questions from textbooks, showing its value.
- The framework connects geometric and logical reasoning, enabling diagnosis of model failures beyond just geometry topics.
- The dataset generation process allows creating problems with controllable difficulty along various axes like depth, distractors etc.

In summary, this paper presents GeomVerse, a diagnostic benchmark to systematically analyze and improve reasoning of VLMs on multi-modal geometry problems requiring textual and visual understanding. The analysis reveals current VLMs are not as capable on geometry topics as past benchmarks suggested. The dataset and framework offer ways to improve and evaluate progress in this space.
