# [GeomVerse: A Systematic Evaluation of Large Models for Geometric   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical reasoning is an important capability for AI systems, but most existing datasets focus on textual problems. Many mathematical problems contain both text and images, especially geometry questions which are common in math competitions and curriculum. 
- General vision-language models (VLMs) have not been systematically evaluated on their ability to perform multi-modal, multi-hop mathematical reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a synthetic dataset called GeomVerse of geometry questions with controllable levels of reasoning difficulty along multiple axes (depth, width, distractors, etc).
- The geometry questions and solutions are automatically generated by making analogies to logical theories and using a backward chaining procedure. 
- They systematically evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs on GeomVerse by finetuning the models and analyzing their reasoning performance.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the first large-scale synthetic benchmark for evaluating visual and textual reasoning of VLMs on geometry problems.
- Systematic analysis reveals limitations of current VLMs in multi-modal, multi-hop reasoning - performance significantly drops with depth rather than width, and does not generalize well to new shapes.
- Finetuning on the synthetic dataset improves performance on real geometry questions from textbooks, showing its value.
- The framework connects geometric and logical reasoning, enabling diagnosis of model failures beyond just geometry topics.
- The dataset generation process allows creating problems with controllable difficulty along various axes like depth, distractors etc.

In summary, this paper presents GeomVerse, a diagnostic benchmark to systematically analyze and improve reasoning of VLMs on multi-modal geometry problems requiring textual and visual understanding. The analysis reveals current VLMs are not as capable on geometry topics as past benchmarks suggested. The dataset and framework offer ways to improve and evaluate progress in this space.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper procedurally generates a synthetic dataset of multi-step geometry questions requiring reasoning over text and images to systematically evaluate vision-language models, revealing limitations in their reasoning abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new synthetic dataset called GeomVerse for systematically evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) on geometry problems.

Key points about the GeomVerse dataset and its use:

- It contains procedurally generated geometry questions with controllable difficulty levels along multiple axes like depth and width of reasoning, distractors, etc. This allows systematic evaluation of models.

- It requires multi-hop mathematical reasoning over both text and images, allowing the evaluation of reasoning abilities of VLMs. 

- Experiments using GeomVerse unveil strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art VLMs in geometric reasoning. For example, increasing depth of reasoning substantially reduces performance, showing a gap versus human ability.

- Finetuning VLMs on GeomVerse improves performance on real geometry questions from an existing dataset, showing its value.

So in summary, the key contribution is the new benchmark GeomVerse that enables a granular analysis of reasoning skills of language models through geometry question answering.

The paper introduces a new synthetically generated dataset called GeomVerse for evaluating vision-language models on geometric reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning over text and images. The dataset allows systematic analysis along axes like depth and width of reasoning, generalization ability, etc. The authors perform experiments using state-of-the-art VLMs to showcase gaps in their reasoning abilities, especially as the depth increases. They also do failure analysis to understand the limitations, and test generalization to real geometry questions. Overall, the key focus is on benchmarking and improving multi-modal multi-hop reasoning for geometry problems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the dataset can generate geometry problems containing a tree of shapes where each shape is connected to its parent shape via a single side or angle. What modifications could be made to the generation algorithm to handle more complex connections between shapes (e.g. two sides, overlapping shapes)?

2. One limitation mentioned is that the generated problems may not require much creativity to solve. How could the generation process be altered to create problems requiring more out-of-the-box thinking or creativity? 

3. The depth and width of reasoning seem to significantly impact model performance. Are there other axes along which reasoning difficulty could be systematically controlled during dataset generation?

4. Could the analogy to logical theories and the backward chaining strategy be applied to generate datasets testing reasoning abilities in other STEM domains like physics or chemistry? What would need to be defined in those cases?

5. The model performance on out-of-distribution test sets degrades significantly. What data augmentation or training strategies could help improve generalization ability? 

6. For what types of real-world applications would you expect the current models to be sufficiently capable if deployed? What additional training or modifications would be needed before deployment?

7. The paper focuses on evaluating existing VLMs. If one wanted to design a model specifically for geometric reasoning, what architectural or objective function modifications seem worth exploring? 

8. How suitable is the proposed dataset generation process for creating an ongoing stream of new problems and adding them to the training set in a lifelong learning setup?

9. The model struggles more with depth versus width of reasoning. Intuitively, why might chained reasoning be more difficult than branching reasoning of the same depth?

10. What other modalities could be incorporated in the dataset generation process (e.g. interactive diagrams, numeric inputs)? Would analogies to logical reasoning still apply in those cases?
