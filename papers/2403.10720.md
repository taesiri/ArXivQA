# [Development and Application of a Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm for   Simulating Da Vinci Code Game Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates the performance of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a prominent AI decision-making algorithm, for game strategy simulation. Specifically, it examines how MCTS is impacted by branch divergence, which occurs in GPU parallel processing architectures.

- Branch divergence diminishes GPU parallel performance due to threads needing to process different execution paths. This can significantly slow MCTS which relies on large-scale parallel simulation to evaluate possible moves.  

- The paper posits that the Da Vinci Code board game exhibits inherent branch divergence in gameplay, making it suitable for analyzing MCTS efficiency. The key trait is guessing opponents' tiles, where a correct guess enables additional guesses, creating divergent iteration.

Methodology:
- Two variants of MCTS were implemented - CPU-based leveraging OpenMP (MCTS-cpu), and GPU-based using CUDA (MCTS-gpu) to assess branch divergence impact.

- The algorithms were simplified by removing flexible consecutive guessing and limiting tree depth expansion to improve feasibility. Dual evaluation metrics were execution time and simulations per second.

Results: 
- Execution time grows linearly with more simulations, establishing it as the prime throughput constraint. Performance depended more on memory access with fewer simulations but was dictated by computation with more simulations.

- MCTS-cpu displayed linear gains in simulations per second with more threads, capped only by total cores. In contrast, MCTS-gpu showed a non-linear trend attributed to memory contention and branch divergence degrading improvements from higher threads.

Conclusion:
- The key findings demonstrate markedly different scalability patterns between MCTS on CPU (linear) and GPU (non-linear, performance troughs) platforms. 

- The analysis provides improved understanding of how MCTS encounters challenges from branch divergence in games, specifically when leveraging GPU parallelism for expedited decision-making.
