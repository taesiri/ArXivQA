# [Towards General Computer Control: A Multimodal Agent for Red Dead   Redemption II as a Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03186)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Despite recent progress, existing foundation agents (powered by large language models) still cannot generalize across different tasks and scenarios. This is mainly due to dramatic differences in observations (inputs) and actions (outputs) between scenarios. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose the concept of General Computer Control (GCC) - building foundation agents that can master any computer task by taking screen images and audio as input, and producing keyboard and mouse operations as output, similar to human-computer interaction. 

To achieve this, they introduce Cradle - an agent framework with strong reasoning abilities for self-reflection, task inference and skill curation to ensure generalizability and self-improvement across tasks. Cradle has modules for environment interaction, information gathering, memory, reasoning (reflection, inference, curation, planning) and action execution. It uses GPT-4V as the backbone model.

Case Study and Contributions:
As a case study, Cradle is deployed in the complex game Red Dead Redemption II (RDR2). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to enable LMM agents to follow main storylines and finish missions in AAA games with minimal reliance on prior knowledge. Specific contributions include:

- Proposing GCC as a milestone towards AGI in the digital world 

- Introducing Cradle - a novel agent framework for GCC with self-reasoning abilities

- Showcasing Cradle's capabilities by incorporating GPT-4V and deploying it in RDR2

- Enabling LMM agents to complete concrete missions in complex AAA games from scratch for the first time

The work serves as a preliminary attempt at GCC in complex and challenging environments like RDR2.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a multimodal agent framework called Cradle that aims to enable foundation models to perform complex computer tasks through human-like interaction, taking screen images and audio as input and outputting keyboard and mouse operations, with a case study deployment in the game Red Dead Redemption 2.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the novel setting of General Computer Control (GCC), which serves as a milestone towards AGI in the digital world. In GCC, agents take multimodal observations as inputs (e.g. screenshots, audio) and output keyboard and mouse operations to control any computer software/application.

2. Proposing a novel foundation agent framework called Cradle for the GCC setting. Cradle has strong reasoning abilities including self-reflection, task inference, and skill curation to ensure its generalizability and self-improvement across various computer tasks.

3. Demonstrating Cradle's capabilities by incorporating the Large Multimodal Model GPT-4V into the framework and deploying it in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption II. This is the first work that enables an LMM-based agent to follow the main storyline and finish real missions in AAA games with minimal reliance on prior knowledge.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) proposing the GCC setting (2) the Cradle framework targeting GCC (3) a case study of deploying Cradle in the game Red Dead Redemption II.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- General Computer Control (GCC): The proposed setting where agents interact with any computer task through standardized inputs (screen, audio) and outputs (keyboard, mouse operations). This is presented as a milestone towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) in the digital world.

- Foundation agents: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and other advanced AI tools. The paper explores using such agents, specifically the LMM GPT-4V, to pursue the GCC setting.

- Red Dead Redemption II (RDR2): The complex, high-fidelity video game used as a case study to evaluate the proposed Cradle framework in pursuing GCC with a challenging target application.

- Multimodal observations: Inputs to the agent span multiple modalities like images, text, audio. Aligning and reasoning over such diverse observations poses a key challenge. 

- Keyboard and mouse control: Precise control over keyboard presses and holds, mouse movement and clicks is critical to properly interact with the computer in the GCC setting. This forms the action space.

- Self-reflection, task inference, skill curation: Key reasoning modules in the Cradle framework that provide abilities like assessing past actions, determining next tasks, and acquiring or improving skills to ensure generalizability across computer tasks.

In summary, the key ideas explored are using LLMs/foundation agents to achieve general control of computers through multimodal observations and keyboard/mouse actions. Terms like GCC, RDR2, self-reflection, and skill curation are central to this goal.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a new agent framework called Cradle for the General Computer Control (GCC) setting. What are some key capabilities and modules in Cradle that make it suitable for this challenging setting?

2) The paper deploys Cradle in the complex game Red Dead Redemption II (RDR2). What are some key characteristics of RDR2 that make it a good test case to evaluate Cradle's capabilities towards GCC?

3) The Information Gathering module in Cradle uses both textual and visual information from screenshots. What are some limitations of GPT-4V that required additional visual augmentation in this module and how was augmentation achieved?

4) The Self-Reflection module in Cradle evaluates previous actions and decides when to continue or stop them. What is an example situation that demonstrates the importance of this capability?

5) The Skill Curation module enables Cradle to expand its skill set based on in-game instructions. How does the framework ensure newly learned skills are valid and leverageable?  

6) The Action Planning module selects skills and plans actions based on the current context. Why does Cradle only execute the first suggested action instead of a sequence?

7) The Memory module in Cradle maintains both short-term episodic memory and long-term summaries. Why are both required and how do they interact?

8) What are some key challenges that a complex 3D game like RDR2 poses, beyond just the GCC setting complexity, for an agent like Cradle?

9) The paper claims Cradle is the first LMM-based agent to complete concrete missions in a AAA game. What evidence supports this claim?

10) What enhancements or future work directions are discussed at the end of the paper to make Cradle a more powerful and generalizable framework for GCC?
