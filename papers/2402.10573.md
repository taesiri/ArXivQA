# [LinkNER: Linking Local Named Entity Recognition Models to Large Language   Models using Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Named entity recognition (NER) models struggle to recognize unseen entities not encountered during training, including out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and out-of-domain (OOD) entities. This limits their reliability for web applications.  
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have extensive knowledge to recognize unseen entities, but lack specialty for the NER task itself.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LinkNER, a framework to link a local NER model with an LLM to synergistically utilize their complementary strengths.

- The local model handles entity recognition and detects uncertain entities using uncertainty estimation methods. Four methods evaluated: confidence-based, entropy-based, Monte Carlo dropout, evidential learning.

- Uncertain entities are sent to the LLM for entity classification, transformed into a simpler multiple choice question format. This Recognition-Detection-Classification (RDC) strategy bridges the specialty of the local model with the vast knowledge of the LLM.

- In-context learning with label descriptions and few-shot examples further equips the LLM with task specifics.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring linking local NER models with LLMs to combine their complementary strengths. 

- Proposed the RDC strategy to enable effective bi-directional interaction between the models based on uncertainty.

- Extensive experiments show LinkNER achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple datasets, especially outperforming on robustness tests for unseen entities by 3-21% F1 score.

- Provide analysis and recommendations on factors like uncertainty methods, LLM choices, and in-context learning scenarios for LinkNER variations.
