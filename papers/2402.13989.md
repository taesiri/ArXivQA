# [FedADMM-InSa: An Inexact and Self-Adaptive ADMM for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13989)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Federated learning (FL) encounters challenges like heterogeneous data/systems, limited communication, and constrained local computational resources. 
- Existing FedADMM methods still suffer from performance deterioration and straggler effect if hyperparameters like local training workload and penalty parameter are not properly tuned.

Proposed Solution - FedADMM-InSa:
- An inexactness criterion that removes the need to preset local training accuracy. Clients can dynamically adjust precision based on unique situations. Saves computation while mitigating straggler effect.
- A self-adaptive scheme to adjust each client's penalty parameter by balancing primal and dual residuals. Enhances robustness without risks from improper penalty parameter selection.

Main Contributions:
- Inexactness criterion that clients can assess independently to reduce local computation and address heterogeneity. Convergence analyzed under strongly convex loss assumptions.
- Self-adaptive penalty parameter scheme that dynamically tunes based on model disparity between client and server. Significantly boosts algorithm robustness.  
- Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate improved performance - 64.3% less local computations and accelerated learning compared to vanilla FedADMM.

In summary, the paper develops an enhanced FedADMM algorithm called FedADMM-InSa that equips both an inexactness criterion and self-adaptive scheme. This eliminates the need for intricate hyperparameter tuning, reduces local computations, handles heterogeneity better and accelerates learning. Both theory and experiments validate the efficiency and flexibility of FedADMM-InSa.
