# [JAMMIN-GPT: Text-based Improvisation using LLMs in Ableton Live](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03479)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces JAMMIN-GPT, a system that allows Ableton Live users to create MIDI clips by typing musical descriptions directly into clip names. It integrates the ChatGPT language model into the Ableton workflow to generate MIDI data from text prompts in formats like ABC notation or chord symbols. When a user renames a clip, JAMMIN-GPT sends the clip name to ChatGPT to generate corresponding MIDI which is inserted into the clip. This allows users to quickly ideate and iterate by expressing musical ideas in plain language without disrupting their creative flow. The system was tested by Ableton users who found it intuitive as it leverages the familiar Ableton interface. While musicality varies across formats, JAMMIN-GPT shows promise in utilizing large language models to fluidly translate text to MIDI within existing creative workflows. The modular design allows the underlying model to be swapped out as the technology progresses.
