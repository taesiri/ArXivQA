# [Dichotomy of Control: Separating What You Can Control from What You   Cannot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13435)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that conditioning policies on latent variable representations of the future in a constrained way can allow return-conditioned supervised learning to be effective in stochastic environments. 

Specifically, the paper argues that standard return-conditioned supervised learning fails in stochastic environments because the return or other future conditioning signal may depend heavily on uncontrollable environment stochasticity, rather than just the policy's actions. They propose a method called "dichotomy of control" that conditions policies on latent variable representations of the future, while constraining these representations to not contain information about future rewards or transitions - only future actions. This allows the policy to maximize over controllable actions without also inadvertently maximizing environment stochasticity.

The central hypothesis is that by learning latent variable representations of the future that isolate controllable information, dichotomy of control can enable effective return-conditioned supervised learning in stochastic environments where standard approaches fail. Theoretical results and experiments on stochastic bandit and FrozenLake environments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Identifying a key issue with return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) methods like Decision Transformer in stochastic environments - specifically, that conditioning on high returns observed in a dataset can lead to inconsistent policies that rely on unlikely stochastic events to try to achieve those returns. 

2. Proposing a method called "Dichotomy of Control" (DoC) to address this issue. DoC conditions policies on a latent variable representation of the future while constraining that latent variable to not contain information about uncontrollable environment stochasticity (only controllable action information).

3. Providing theoretical results showing that DoC yields policies that are "consistent" - meaning conditioning them on a certain return will actually induce behavior that achieves that return. 

4. Empirically demonstrating that DoC outperforms RCSL methods like Decision Transformer on highly stochastic environments where RCSL fails due to inconsistency issues.

5. Showing limitations with some other proposed solutions to RCSL inconsistency, like clustering trajectories based on returns.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be identifying an issue with popular RCSL methods, proposing a principled solution called DoC that provides consistency guarantees, and empirically demonstrating its advantages over RCSL and other alternatives on stochastic environments. The theory and experiments to validate DoC appear to be the key novel components.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Dichotomy of Control that separates controllable and uncontrollable sources of stochasticity when learning policies via future-conditioned supervised learning, enabling more consistent policies compared to prior return-conditioned supervised learning approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper compares to other work in offline reinforcement learning (RL), particularly return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) methods like Decision Transformer and offline RL methods. The key differences are:

- It identifies a key failure point of RCSL in stochastic environments, where conditioning on high returns can be misleading and produce inconsistent policies. This issue was noted previously but not addressed. 

- It proposes a novel method called dichotomy of control (DoC) to address RCSL's inconsistency by separating controllable (actions) from uncontrollable (transitions, rewards) factors using mutual information constraints. This is a new approach.

- It theoretically proves DoC learns consistent policies, unlike RCSL. This analysis of consistency is novel.

- It empirically demonstrates DoC's benefits over RCSL/Decision Transformer and latent variable models without DoC's constraints on highly stochastic environments. Prior works did not systematically evaluate on stochastic environments.

Overall, this work makes both theoretical and empirical contributions over prior art by analyzing RCSL's limitations, proposing DoC to address them, proving DoC's consistency guarantees, and highlighting the benefits on stochastic tasks. The mutual information constraints to separate controllable vs uncontrollable factors is a unique aspect not considered in prior latent variable approaches to RCSL.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

- Extending the theoretical analysis to relax some of the assumptions, such as achieving approximate consistency guarantees under relaxed conditions on the mutual information constraints and Bayes optimality assumption. 

- Applying dichotomy of control to more complex domains like images, natural language, and robotics. The paper notes that dichotomy of control still faces challenges common to supervised learning approaches like "stitching" suboptimal trajectories, so investigating how to address these challenges is an important direction.

- Extending dichotomy of control beyond offline RL to paradigms like online RL. The key idea of separating controllable vs. uncontrollable factors could potentially be useful in other settings.

- Developing algorithms that can automatically determine or learn the dichotomy between controllable and uncontrollable factors, rather than relying on hand-specified mutual information constraints.

- Exploring other techniques from information theory beyond mutual information to induce the desired dichotomy of controllable vs. uncontrollable stochasticity.

- Comparing in more depth to other related methods like BCQ that aim to address overestimation issues in offline RL.

So in summary, the main directions are: 1) improving the theory and relaxing assumptions, 2) scaling up the applications, 3) extending the core ideas beyond offline RL, and 4) developing more automated and advanced ways to learn the dichotomy of control. Overall the paper presents dichotomy of control as a promising approach that likely can be built upon in many fruitful ways.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Dichotomy of Control (DoC) to address a key limitation of return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) methods like Decision Transformer. RCSL trains policies to imitate actions in an offline dataset, conditioning on the eventual return or outcome associated with each trajectory. However, this can lead to inconsistent policies in stochastic environments, where high returns may be due to unlikely environmental randomness rather than good actions. DoC aims to separate controllable factors (the policy's actions) from uncontrollable factors (environment stochasticity). It does so by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representing the future while constraining this latent via mutual information minimization. Specifically, DoC minimizes the mutual information between the latent variable and the future rewards/transitions, ensuring the latent does not contain information about environment stochasticity. 

Theoretically, the paper shows DoC yields policies that are consistent, in the sense that conditioning them on a high-return latent induces behavior that actually achieves high returns. Empirically, DoC is evaluated on bandit and control tasks with stochastic rewards and transitions. It outperforms RCSL methods like Decision Transformer that suffer from inconsistency issues in stochastic settings. DoC also outperforms variational methods that do not properly separate controllable vs uncontrollable factors. The results demonstrate DoC's ability to effectively distinguish what the policy can control from what it cannot.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Dichotomy of Control (DoC) to address the issue of inconsistency in return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) methods like Decision Transformer in stochastic environments. DoC modifies the RCSL objective to condition the policy on a latent variable representation of the future $z$, while enforcing mutual information (MI) constraints between $z$ and the future rewards/transitions. Specifically, DoC minimizes MI(future reward; z | past observations, action) and MI(next state; z | past observations, action) via a contrastive learning objective. This removes any information in $z$ that is solely due to environment stochasticity rather than controllable actions, allowing DoC to maximize over actions without attempting to control transitions. DoC also learns a prior over $z$ and value function $V(z)$ to enable sampling diverse $z$ at inference time and choosing the one with highest $V(z)$ to condition the policy on. Theoretical results show DoC achieves consistency between $V(z)$ and the actual returns of $\pi_z$.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Dichotomy of Control (DoC) to address the issue of inconsistency in return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) algorithms like Decision Transformer in stochastic environments. RCSL policies can exhibit inconsistency, where conditioning on a high return results in actual behavior that achieves much lower returns. This happens because high returns may be due to unlikely transitions that the policy cannot control. DoC separates controllable (actions) from uncontrollable (transitions) by learning a latent variable representation of the future that has zero mutual information with environment stochasticity. Theoretically, DoC is shown to learn policies that are consistent with their conditioning. Empirically, DoC outperforms RCSL and variational methods on stochastic bandit and FrozenLake environments where transitions are stochastic. Overall, DoC provides a way for RCSL methods to combat environment stochasticity by restricting the latent variable to only model controllable aspects of the future.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) methods performing poorly in stochastic environments. 

Specifically, it points out that in RCSL methods like Decision Transformer (DT), the policy is conditioned on a desired return during training. However, in stochastic environments, a high return can arise due to randomness in the environment rather than good actions by the policy. This leads to the policy being inconsistent - conditioning it on a high desired return results in actual returns that are very different.

The key insight is that the inconsistency arises because RCSL methods do not distinguish between controllable factors (the policy's actions) versus uncontrollable factors (the environment's randomness). The paper aims to address this issue.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) - A paradigm for offline reinforcement learning where a policy is trained to predict actions conditioned on a future outcome like return. Methods like Decision Transformer and RvS follow this approach.

- Inconsistency - A key issue with RCSL is that policies can be inconsistent with their conditioning inputs. For example, conditioning on a high return may produce behavior with much lower actual returns. 

- Environment stochasticity - A major reason for RCSL inconsistency is that high returns may be due to randomness in the environment rather than good actions. RCSL cannot distinguish this.

- Future-conditioned supervised learning - A generalization of RCSL where the policy conditions on a latent variable representing the future rather than just a scalar return.

- Variational autoencoder (VAE) - Some works have used a VAE framework with a KL regularizer to learn the latent variable. But the KL does not separate controllable vs uncontrollable stochasticity. 

- Dichotomy of control (DoC) - The proposed method that conditions policies on a latent variable but constrains it via mutual information to not include environmental randomness, only controllable actions.

- Consistency - DoC guarantees consistency between the conditioned value and actual value of a policy. Key theoretical result.

- Mutual information constraint - The key technique in DoC to remove uncontrolled stochasticity from the latent variable. Enforced via a contrastive loss.

So in summary, key ideas are handling environment stochasticity in RCSL, consistency guarantees, and using mutual information constraints to separate controllable vs uncontrollable randomness when conditioning policies.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called Dichotomy of Control (DoC) to address limitations of return-conditioned supervised learning approaches like Decision Transformer in reinforcement learning problems with highly stochastic rewards and transitions. DoC learns a policy conditioned on a latent variable representing the future while minimizing the mutual information between this latent variable and the stochastic rewards/transitions. This forces the latent variable to only contain controllable information about future actions. Theoretically, the authors prove DoC yields policies that are consistent, meaning conditioning on a high return induces high return behavior. Empirically, DoC significantly outperforms Decision Transformer and variational methods using future latent variables without appropriate constraints in stochastic bandit, FrozenLake, and Mujoco environments. The key insight is distinguishing controllable vs uncontrollable factors and only optimizing the policy over controllable actions while marginalizing out uncontrollable environment stochasticity. This allows DoC to avoid poor decisions made by other methods relying on unlikely transitions/rewards.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for offline reinforcement learning called Dichotomy of Control (DoC) that separates controllable factors like agent actions from uncontrollable factors like environment stochasticity when learning from offline data. DoC achieves this separation by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future while minimizing the mutual information between the latent variable and the stochastic rewards/transitions. Theoretically, the paper shows that DoC policies are consistent, meaning conditioning them on a high return will induce high-return behavior. Empirically, DoC is evaluated on stochastic bandit, FrozenLake, and MuJoCo tasks and achieves better performance than popular offline RL algorithms like Decision Transformer. Overall, by distinguishing controllable versus uncontrollable factors, DoC is able to effectively leverage offline data in stochastic environments where other methods like return-conditioned supervised learning struggle.
