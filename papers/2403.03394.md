# [Multiple Update Particle Filter: Position Estimation by Combining GNSS   Pseudorange and Carrier Phase Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of particle degeneracy in particle filters when dealing with likelihood functions that have very sharp peaks. This commonly occurs when using highly accurate measurements like carrier phase measurements from GNSS. If the particles are not located at the peaks of such sharply peaked likelihood functions, their weights become zero. This leads to failure of the particle filter.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a Multiple Update Particle Filter (MU-PF) to address this issue. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage the knowledge that different observations (e.g. GNSS pseudorange and carrier phases) have likelihood functions with different spreads. Pseudorange has a wider spread while carrier phases have very sharp peaks.

2) Perform iterative weight update and resampling using each likelihood function separately in the order from wider to narrower spreads. This gradually shifts particles towards the true position.

3) Applying the sharp peaked carrier phase likelihoods last ensures particles have converged close enough to the peaks to get non-zero weights.

The paper shows how to compute likelihood functions from GNSS pseudorange and carrier phases and integrate them into the MU-PF framework.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposed MU-PF approach to effectively use multiple observations with likelihood functions having different spreads for particle weight update.

2) Method to compute likelihood function for particles from GNSS carrier phases using ambiguity function value instead of explicitly solving for ambiguities.

3) Demonstrated improved performance of MU-PF over normal PF and annealed PF in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for static positioning case.

4) Showcased more accurate position estimation compared to RTK-GNSS in real urban driving dataset using proposed MU-PF with GNSS observations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an efficient particle filter method for position estimation that handles sharp likelihood peaks from multiple observations by iteratively updating and resampling particles based on the spread of likelihood functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The proposed multiple update particle filter (MU-PF) considers the distribution spread of multiple observations, enabling accurate state estimation even in scenarios where the normal particle filter fails due to uniform particle weights in the observation updates.

2. The development of a novel likelihood function utilizing GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observations, and its integration into the MU-PF framework to enhance convergence performance and improve position estimation accuracy compared to conventional methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed MU-PF method that handles multiple observations efficiently by doing iterative weight updates and resampling based on the spread of likelihood functions. This allows accurate estimation even with sharp likelihood peaks and outperforms conventional particle filters. The method is demonstrated for GNSS-based positioning, where it leverages both pseudorange and carrier phase observations to achieve faster convergence and better accuracy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed Multiple Update Particle Filter (MU-PF) performs multiple weight updates and resampling steps using the likelihood functions from different observations. What is the key idea behind determining the order in which the likelihood functions are applied? Explain why applying them in this order is beneficial.

2. How does the proposed method compute the likelihood function using the Ambiguity Function Value (AFV) from carrier phase observations? Explain the rationale behind using the AFV instead of explicitly solving for the integer carrier phase ambiguities.

3. One of the key challenges highlighted is the sample impoverishment problem when using a particle filter with a sharply peaked likelihood function. Explain how the proposed MU-PF is designed to specifically address this problem.

4. What are the differences between the proposed MU-PF and existing methods like Annealed Particle Filter and Cascade Particle Filter? What aspects make MU-PF better suited for handling multiple observations with likelihood functions of varying distribution spreads?

5. The GNSS observations consist of both pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Explain how the double-differenced observations are processed to compute the likelihood function associated with each type of measurement.
