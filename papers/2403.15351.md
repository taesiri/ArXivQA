# [Multi-Review Fusion-in-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15351)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grounded text generation tasks like summarization and question answering are typically handled via end-to-end models, which lack flexibility and interpretability.
- Recent work promoted decomposing these tasks into separate content selection and content fusion steps. 
- However, prior work on content fusion focused on single document inputs, limiting applicability.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper introduces the task of Fusion-in-Context (FiC), extending prior single-doc fusion to multi-doc inputs.  
- Given a set of documents with highlighted spans, the goal is to fuse the highlights into a coherent, non-redundant passage covering all and only the highlighted content.
- This allows the same fusion model to work with different content selection methods based on use case.

Contributions:
- Formal task definition of multi-doc Fusion-in-Context (FiC).
- High-quality dataset of 1000 FiC instances in the reviews domain, created via controlled crowdsourcing.
- Novel evaluation framework assessing faithfulness & coverage of highlights.
- Analysis of several baseline models, showing promising performance but also room for improvement.
- The dataset, evaluation framework and baseline models are released as a benchmark for the FiC task.

Main Benefits:
- Modularity for flexibility and interpretability.
- General fusion model applicable across contexts. 
- Supports interactive and user-driven generation.
- Enables attributed text generation by tracing output to input highlights.

The paper lays the groundwork to explore modular multi-doc text generation, addressing quality and reliability concerns in grounded generative systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces the Fusion-in-Context (FiC) task, a modular grounded text generation approach that focuses on fusing highlighted content from multiple source documents into a coherent passage, and provides a dataset, evaluation framework, and baseline models to stimulate further research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of the Fusion-in-Context (\fic{}) task, which is an extension of the Controlled Text Reduction (CTR) task proposed in previous work by Slobodkin et al. (2022) to multi-document inputs. Specifically, \fic{} takes as input a set of documents with pre-selected highlights (important spans), and generates a coherent, non-redundant passage that fuses all the highlights. This allows for more control, interpretability, and modularity compared to end-to-end grounded text generation systems.

The paper also introduces a new dataset of 1000 \fic{} instances in the business reviews domain, obtained via a controlled crowdsourcing process. Additionally, an evaluation framework focused on faithfulness and coverage of highlights is proposed. Experiments with several baseline models demonstrate promising performance while also indicating room for improvement.

Overall, the paper lays the groundwork to explore modular and controllable text generation in multi-document settings, with potential benefits in reliability, flexibility and attribution over end-to-end approaches. The introduced benchmark aims to stimulate further research on the \fic{} task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Fusion-in-Context (FiC): The core task formalized in the paper, involving fusing highlights from multiple input documents into a coherent output text.

- Highlights: Pre-selected spans within input documents that are expected to be covered in the output passage.

- Faithfulness: The degree to which the generated output text adheres to and is entailed by the content present in the highlights.  

- Coverage: The extent to which all the highlights are represented in some form within the output text.

- Coherence: The fluency, structure and flow of the generated passage.  

- Redundancy: Avoiding repetition of the same information across the output text.

- Multi-document summarization: The paper builds upon and adapts existing multi-document summarization datasets for constructing a dataset for the FiC task.

- Modular text generation: The concept of decomposing end-to-end grounded text generation systems into separate stages of content selection and content fusion.

- Evaluation framework: Novel automatic metrics proposed for evaluating faithfulness and coverage of highlights in the generated outputs.

In summary, the key focus is on multi-document highlight fusion, evaluated based on faithfulness, coverage, coherence and redundancy. The proposed FiC task and benchmark facilitate exploration of modular text generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new task called Fusion-in-Context (FiC). How is this task different from the existing Controlled Text Reduction (CTR) task? What additional challenges does it present?

2. The paper uses existing multi-document summarization datasets to create the FiC dataset. Can you walk through the annotation process in detail? What were some key annotation guidelines given to crowdworkers?

3. The paper proposes separate metrics to evaluate faithfulness and coverage of model outputs. Can you explain the NLI-based faithfulness metric and the trained coverage metric? What are the advantages of these metrics over commonly used ROUGE and BERTScore?

4. The paper experiments with a model trained only on highlights without context (Flan-T5only-H) and a model trained without any highlights (Flan-T5no-H). What do the results using these models reveal about the importance of highlights and context for the FiC task?

5. The paper finds that further fine-tuning the Flan-T5H model with reinforcement learning hurts performance. What could be the potential reasons behind this observation? How can the model be improved?  

6. The FiC task is performed in the business reviews domain. What are some key properties and challenges of generating coherent summaries from conflicting reviews compared to other domains like news?

7. One motivation presented is using FiC models in interactive settings based on user-selected highlights. Can you suggest some potential interactive applications and how they would work?

8. Another motivation is attributed text generation, citing the highlights as support for output claims. How exactly would the highlights help in establishing attribution or provenance for claims in the fused output?

9. The interface showed to crowdworkers emboldens potentially overlapping lemmas between the summary and reviews. Could this bias the annotation process? How may the dataset change if created without such aids?

10. The paper uses crowdworkers from English-speaking countries. How may the annotation process and resulting dataset differ if workers were recruited from non-English-speaking countries? What cultural or linguistic biases may emerge?
