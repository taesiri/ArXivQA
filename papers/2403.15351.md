# [Multi-Review Fusion-in-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15351)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Grounded text generation tasks like summarization and question answering are typically handled via end-to-end models, which lack flexibility and interpretability.
- Recent work promoted decomposing these tasks into separate content selection and content fusion steps. 
- However, prior work on content fusion focused on single document inputs, limiting applicability.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper introduces the task of Fusion-in-Context (FiC), extending prior single-doc fusion to multi-doc inputs.  
- Given a set of documents with highlighted spans, the goal is to fuse the highlights into a coherent, non-redundant passage covering all and only the highlighted content.
- This allows the same fusion model to work with different content selection methods based on use case.

Contributions:
- Formal task definition of multi-doc Fusion-in-Context (FiC).
- High-quality dataset of 1000 FiC instances in the reviews domain, created via controlled crowdsourcing.
- Novel evaluation framework assessing faithfulness & coverage of highlights.
- Analysis of several baseline models, showing promising performance but also room for improvement.
- The dataset, evaluation framework and baseline models are released as a benchmark for the FiC task.

Main Benefits:
- Modularity for flexibility and interpretability.
- General fusion model applicable across contexts. 
- Supports interactive and user-driven generation.
- Enables attributed text generation by tracing output to input highlights.

The paper lays the groundwork to explore modular multi-doc text generation, addressing quality and reliability concerns in grounded generative systems.
