# [SoftTiger: A Clinical Foundation Model for Healthcare Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SoftTiger: A Clinical Foundation Model for Healthcare Workflows":

Problem:
- Healthcare professionals face excessive workload, spending nearly half their time on digital paperwork rather than patient care. This contributes to physician burnout, medical errors, and poor patient outcomes.  
- Clinical data is predominantly unstructured narratives in notes, hampering the development of intelligent healthcare systems. There is a need to structure clinical notes into standardized formats.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM) aimed at automating clinical data structuring - converting free-text notes into structured clinical data.
- They focus on three critical workflow tasks: generating a patient summary (FHIR IPS), clinical impression, and medical encounter summary.
- SoftTiger is fine-tuned on a SOTA general-purpose LLM using public and private clinical data. The training flow allows it to first support basic NLP tasks before more complex clinical tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Release of SoftTiger CLaM models with 13B and 70B parameters, trained using innovative methods for long context window for clinical notes.
- New training data for the three clinical workflow tasks, with 100 MIMIC notes structured by GPT-4 and physician-validated. 
- SoftTiger outperforms other popular open and closed-source models in blind evaluations, achieving performance comparable to GPT-3.5 and Gemini-pro.
- Open-sourced scalable evaluation methodology using chatbot arena with LLM-as-a-judge, to enable rapid experimentation.
- Addresses critical challenges around clinical language understanding, workflow integration, and model evaluation to accelerate healthcare AI adoption.
