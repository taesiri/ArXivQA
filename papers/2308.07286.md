# [The Devil is in the Errors: Leveraging Large Language Models for   Fine-grained Machine Translation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07286)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can large language models (LLMs) be leveraged to provide automatic machine translation evaluation that is high quality, interpretable, and requires minimal labeled data? 

Specifically, the authors investigate using LLMs for machine translation evaluation in two main ways:

1) Prompting LLMs to predict quality scores. They compare the performance of models like PaLM and PaLM-2 on score prediction to previous methods and learned metrics.

2) Proposing AutoMQM, a novel prompting technique that has LLMs identify and classify errors according to the MQM framework. This provides more interpretable evaluation compared to just score prediction.

The key hypotheses seem to be:

- LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance on system-level MT evaluation through simple prompting for scores.

- additional techniques like finetuning or AutoMQM prompting can improve segment-level correlation and interpretability compared to just score prediction prompting. 

- AutoMQM in particular can produce high-quality error annotations that correlate well with human judgments, despite using only a small number of annotated examples.

So in summary, the main research question is how to best leverage the properties of LLMs (scale, prompting, finetuning, in-context learning) to develop automatic MT evaluation techniques that are accurate, data-efficient, and interpretable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique that leverages large language models (LLMs) to evaluate machine translation quality in an interpretable way by identifying and categorizing errors according to the MQM framework. 

The key points are:

- They first evaluate recent LLMs on machine translation evaluation through simple score prediction prompting, and study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning and finetuning.

- They propose AutoMQM, which prompts LLMs to identify error spans and classify them according to MQM rather than just predict a score. This provides interpretability by showing which errors are responsible for the quality assessment.

- They show that AutoMQM improves performance compared to just prompting for scores, especially for larger models. The predicted error spans also align reasonably well with human annotations.

- The findings demonstrate the potential of using LLMs to provide informative, interpretable feedback on machine translation quality in a data-efficient way, without needing a lot of human judgment data like previous learned metrics.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting AutoMQM as a way to get greater insight into machine translation evaluation using the capabilities of LLMs, providing both high quality scores and interpretability through error analysis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes AutoMQM, a novel technique for evaluating machine translation quality that leverages large language models to identify and categorize errors according to the Multidimensional Quality Metrics framework, providing more informative and interpretable feedback compared to standard automatic metrics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work in the field of using large language models for machine translation evaluation:

- The paper confirms previous findings that large language models (LLMs) like GPT can act as effective zero-shot evaluators when prompted to predict quality scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance at the system level. However, it shows they still underperform learned metrics like COMET at the segment level.

- It provides new evidence that finetuning LLMs on human judgment data can improve their segment-level correlation, allowing them to match or exceed metrics like COMET. This addresses a limitation of prior work focused only on prompting.

- The paper is the first to systematically evaluate LLMs for MT evaluation in low-resource languages. It finds their zero-shot performance is promising but still lags behind learned metrics. 

- The main novel contribution is proposing AutoMQM, which improves over just score prediction by prompting LLMs to identify error spans and types. This provides greater interpretability.

- AutoMQM outperforms score prediction, especially for larger models like PaLM-2 Unicorn. The error spans also correlate reasonably well with human annotations.

- Prior work either focused solely on score prediction or required supervised data to identify errors. AutoMQM shows LLMs can generate useful error annotations in a zero/few-shot prompting setting.

- The results provide new evidence that scale is important for LLM-based fine-grained evaluation, with larger models like Unicorn outperforming smaller ones.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of what LLMs can and cannot currently do for MT evaluation. The proposed AutoMQM approach and findings around finetuning and model scale advance the state-of-the-art in interpretable and effective LLM-based evaluation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Finetuning LLMs on fine-grained human judgment data (like MQM annotations): The authors find that finetuning improves the segment-level performance of LLMs for score prediction. They suggest finetuning on richer data like MQM could further enhance performance.

- Applying prompting techniques like AutoMQM to other evaluation problems: The authors highlight the general-purpose nature of LLMs and suggest that similar prompting approaches could be applied to other text generation evaluation tasks beyond machine translation.

- Improving interpretability of LLM-based evaluators: While AutoMQM provides some interpretability through error spans, the authors suggest there is room for improvement, such as generating natural language rationales or explanations.

- Evaluating cross-lingual transfer learning: The authors evaluated AutoMQM in a monolingual setting but suggest evaluating the cross-lingual transfer capabilities of the approach.

- Comparing against other prompting techniques: The authors used a simple prompting approach and suggest comparing against more complex prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.

- Leveraging external knowledge: The authors suggest incorporating external knowledge sources could improve LLM-based evaluators.

- Studying controllable generation: The authors propose exploring if the errors identified by AutoMQM could be leveraged to do controllable regeneration of improved translations.

In summary, the key directions focus on improving performance through techniques like finetuning, enhancing interpretability, and expanding the approach to broader settings and tasks. The authors highlight the promise of leveraging LLMs for evaluation and suggest several interesting avenues for extending this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for machine translation evaluation through score prediction and a novel method called AutoMQM. The authors first show that prompting LLMs for score prediction leads to state-of-the-art system-level performance, but lags behind learned metrics at the segment level. Finetuning the LLMs improves segment-level correlation.

The paper provides a thorough investigation of LLM capabilities for MT evaluation with and without references, prompting vs finetuning, and low/high resource scenarios. Key findings are that finetuning is important for segment-level metrics, AutoMQM boosts segment correlations while maintaining interpretability through error spans, and model scale improves metric quality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for machine translation evaluation through score prediction and a novel technique called AutoMQM. The authors first evaluate LLMs on score prediction, where the model is prompted to generate a single quality score for a translation. They find that prompting LLMs for score prediction leads to state-of-the-art system-level evaluators, but still falls short of the best learned metrics at the segment-level. Finetuning the LLMs on human judgment data is shown to improve segment-level performance. The authors then propose AutoMQM, which prompts LLMs to identify error spans in a translation and categorize them according to the MQM framework. A score is derived automatically from the identified errors rather than asking the model to generate one. Experiments show that AutoMQM improves performance over score prediction, especially for larger models, while also providing interpretability through the predicted error spans. The error spans from AutoMQM are found to align well with human annotations, successfully identifying most major errors. Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of leveraging LLMs for machine translation evaluation and generating more fine-grained, interpretable feedback.

In summary, this paper first benchmarks LLMs on the task of score prediction for machine translation evaluation. While LLMs achieve strong system-level performance when prompted for scores, segment-level performance lags behind supervised methods until the LLMs are finetuned on human judgments. The authors then propose AutoMQM which instead prompts LLMs to identify and categorize errors according to the MQM scheme, from which scores are derived automatically. AutoMQM is shown to outperform score prediction and produce error spans that correlate well with human annotations, demonstrating the promise of using LLMs for fine-grained translation evaluation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called AutoMQM for machine translation evaluation using large language models (LLMs). AutoMQM leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by prompting them to identify errors in a translation and categorize them according to the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework. Rather than only predicting a single quality score like previous approaches, AutoMQM asks the LLM to output the locations of errors in the translation along with their severity and category based on MQM. A key advantage of AutoMQM is that the errors identified by the LLM can then be used to automatically generate an overall quality score using the standard MQM scoring procedure. This allows AutoMQM to provide more interpretable and informative feedback compared to metrics that only output a single score. The authors evaluate AutoMQM using PaLM and PaLM-2 models on high-resource and low-resource language pairs. They show that AutoMQM outperforms simply prompting the LLM for a quality score, especially for larger models like PaLM-2. The error spans identified by AutoMQM also exhibit good alignment with human annotations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of automatically evaluating machine translation quality in a more interpretable and human-like way. The key questions it seems to be tackling are:

1. How can we leverage large language models (LLMs) to evaluate machine translation, and how do they compare to existing learned metrics?

2. Can we prompt LLMs to not just predict a single quality score, but actually identify and categorize errors like human annotators do with the MQM framework? 

3. Does prompting LLMs to provide more interpretable outputs in this way actually lead to better evaluation performance?

4. How does the performance compare in high-resource vs low-resource language pairs?

5. How robust and reliable is this method of prompting LLMs for fine-grained evaluation?

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called AutoMQM that prompts LLMs to identify error spans in translations and classify them into MQM error types. It then automatically derives a quality score from these annotations, providing more interpretable outputs. The key innovation seems to be leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through prompting to get structured, human-like feedback.

The paper evaluates AutoMQM extensively, comparing against baselines like prompting LLMs just for scores as well as learned metrics. It analyzes the performance in terms of correlation with human judgments of quality, both at the system and segment level. It also evaluates the quality of the predicted error spans themselves. The aim is to demonstrate that AutoMQM leads to improved translation evaluation, especially for larger LLMs.
