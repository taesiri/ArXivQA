# [HumanGen: Generating Human Radiance Fields with Explicit Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05321)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images, with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering capabilities? 

The key hypothesis is that 3D human generation can benefit from incorporating more explicit priors from other research areas, such as top-tier 2D human generators and 3D human reconstruction methods. The authors propose that by leveraging these richer priors, compared to just using a SMPL model like previous work, their method can achieve higher quality 3D human generation.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel neural scheme called HumanGen to generate radiance fields for 3D humans using priors from 2D generation and 3D reconstruction models. This allows generating humans with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents HumanGen, a novel neural scheme to generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images. 

2. It proposes a hybrid feature representation using an anchor image generated by a 2D generator to bridge the latent space with existing 2D generators.

3. It designs a pronged network with separate geometry and appearance branches. The geometry branch utilizes a pretrained 3D reconstructor to provide fine details. 

4. It introduces an implicit blending field and two-stage blending strategy to generate high-quality textures, incorporating details from the anchor image.

5. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results in 3D human generation with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering.

6. It shows the compatibility of HumanGen with existing 2D latent editing methods by editing the anchor image.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework to leverage explicit priors from 2D generators and 3D reconstructors to achieve high-quality 3D-aware human generation with geometry details and view consistency. The use of the anchor image is critical to bridge 2D and 3D spaces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel 3D human generation method called HumanGen that leverages explicit priors from a pre-trained 2D generator and 3D reconstructor to achieve high quality human radiance field generation with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360 degree free-view rendering ability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key things I notice about how this paper compares to other research on generating 3D human radiance fields:

- It focuses on generating high-quality 3D human models with realistic appearance and geometry details, allowing free-view rendering from any angle. This is an active research area, but generating detailed 3D humans remains challenging compared to other 3D contents. 

- The key novelty is leveraging explicit priors from 2D human image generators and 3D human reconstruction models. This allows incorporating strong human appearance and geometry priors rather than just relying on limited 3D supervision.

- It outperforms recent state-of-the-art 3D human generation methods like GNARF, EVA3D, and AvatarGen in terms of texture realism and geometry quality, based on quantitative metrics and visual results. The two-branch design using anchor images and fine-grained geometry supervision leads to improvements.

- It maintains compatibility with pretrained 2D GANs like StyleGAN and can leverage 2D editing techniques for controllable 3D editing. This is a useful benefit compared to training a 3D GAN from scratch.

- The training data uses a view-balanced human dataset synthesized by a 2D GAN to address dataset bias in real human images. This is a practical solution compared to methods that try to re-sample biased datasets.

- Limitations include potential bias inherited from the 2D GAN, lack of extreme out-of-distribution generalization, and no skeletal pose control. The reliance on explicit priors could restrict radical novel generations compared to a fully unconditional 3D GAN.

Overall, the paper introduces useful techniques like anchor images, geometry adaptation, and two-stage blending for high-quality 3D human generation. The results are state-of-the-art, while maintaining useful compatibility with 2D GANs. Key limitations are the need for strong explicit priors and limited generalization beyond the priors.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the view distribution balance of the training data. The current approach uses a dataset augmented from a view-biased 2D generator, so biases may still exist in the quality of generated humans across different poses/views. The authors suggest collecting a real dataset with more balanced view distributions and identities would be beneficial.

- Exploring motion/pose control for the generated humans. Currently, the method does not support continuous skeletal pose manipulation. The authors suggest incorporating motion priors like SMPL into the framework could enable deformable human generation with pose control. But this would likely require more diverse training data.

- Extending the generation abilities beyond the current priors. The use of explicit 2D and 3D priors currently limits out-of-domain generalization. Reducing the dependency on priors or finding ways to learn more flexible priors could improve the diversity of generated humans.

- Addressing remaining artifacts/imperfections. The authors note some remaining differences from real humans are still noticeable upon close inspection. Continued improvements to the texture, geometry, and view consistency could enhance the realism further.

- Exploiting the generated virtual humans. The authors suggest the high-quality 3D human generation could enable many applications in VR/AR and visual effects. More research can build upon the method for downstream tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving the diversity, flexibility, realism, and applicability of the human generation through advances in training data, motion control, reducing reliance on priors, and enhancing details. Leveraging the generated humans for downstream applications is also noted as an area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents HumanGen, a novel approach for generating high-quality radiance fields of 3D humans from 2D images. In contrast to existing methods that only use the SMPL prior, HumanGen leverages richer priors from top-tier 2D generators and 3D reconstructors. It introduces a hybrid feature representation using an anchor image that shares a latent space with a pretrained 2D generator. This bridges the latent spaces to utilize 2D generation priors. For geometry, it adapts a 3D reconstructor to provide fine detail supervision. For texture, it proposes a two-stage blending using the anchor image to enhance quality. Experiments demonstrate HumanGen generates 3D humans with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360 degree free-view rendering. It also enables seamlessly upgrading 2D image editing techniques to 3D. The key ideas are using the anchor image to incorporate explicit 2D and 3D priors into a 3D GAN framework, adapting reconstruction models to aid generation, and designing texture blending to leverage 2D details. This achieves state-of-the-art photo-realistic human generation with geometry details and view consistency.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents HumanGen, a novel method for generating high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images. The key idea is to leverage explicit priors from pre-trained 2D generative models and 3D reconstruction models to aid the training of the 3D radiance field generator. The method has a hybrid feature representation that includes an "anchor image" generated by a 2D StyleGAN model and tri-plane features from EG3D. The geometry branch uses a pretrained 3D human reconstructor PIFuHD to provide pixel-aligned features and occupancy supervision to generate a detailed signed distance field. The appearance branch learns texture and blending fields to merge information from the anchor image and 3D features. It uses a two-stage blending process to render high-quality textures. The model is trained in a GAN framework with additional consistency losses between the frontal and back views.

Experiments demonstrate that HumanGen can generate 3D humans with significantly more detailed geometry and higher quality, view-consistent textures compared to prior work. It also enables seamless integration with existing 2D image manipulation techniques by sharing the latent space with the anchor image. Limitations include residual view distribution bias and lack of continuous pose control. But overall, HumanGen represents an important advance in high-fidelity 3D human generative modeling with applications in VR/AR and visual effects. The use of explicit priors helps overcome major challenges in modeling complex human geometry and clothing.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper presents HumanGen, a novel approach to generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images. The key idea is to leverage explicit priors from pre-trained 2D image generators and 3D human reconstructors. It uses a 2D generator to create an "anchor image" which shares its latent space to guide 3D generation. For geometry, it adapts a pre-trained reconstructer to provide pixel-aligned features and convert its occupancy field to a signed distance field for efficient volume rendering. For texture, it learns appearance and blending fields to merge information from the anchor image and 3D features. It uses a two-stage blending process to fully utilize the rich textures of the anchor image. The method is trained in an adversarial manner with additional front-view and back-view consistency losses. By leveraging these explicit 2D and 3D priors, HumanGen is able to generate 3D humans with high-quality geometry details and photo-realistic free-view rendering. As a side benefit, compatibility with 2D latent editing techniques is maintained through the shared anchor image latent space.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating high-quality 3D human radiance fields from 2D images. Specifically, it aims to generate humans with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360-degree free-view rendering ability.

The key challenges and limitations it identifies with existing work on 3D human generation are:

- Existing 3D GANs for human generation rely only on coarse skeleton pose priors like SMPL, lacking fine geometry details. The neural rendering used also cannot guarantee meaningful 3D geometry generation, leading to artifacts.

- Current 3D human generators are trained on limited datasets lacking diversity or heavily biased towards front views. This limits their ability for realistic around-view rendering.

- There is a lack of mechanisms to explicitly utilize richer human priors available from other research areas like top 2D human generators and 3D human reconstruction methods.

To address these issues, the paper presents a novel "HumanGen" approach to generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans by leveraging explicit priors from pre-trained 2D generators and 3D reconstructors.
