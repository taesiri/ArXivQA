# [HumanGen: Generating Human Radiance Fields with Explicit Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05321)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images, with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering capabilities? 

The key hypothesis is that 3D human generation can benefit from incorporating more explicit priors from other research areas, such as top-tier 2D human generators and 3D human reconstruction methods. The authors propose that by leveraging these richer priors, compared to just using a SMPL model like previous work, their method can achieve higher quality 3D human generation.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel neural scheme called HumanGen to generate radiance fields for 3D humans using priors from 2D generation and 3D reconstruction models. This allows generating humans with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering ability.
