# [HumanGen: Generating Human Radiance Fields with Explicit Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05321)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images, with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering capabilities? 

The key hypothesis is that 3D human generation can benefit from incorporating more explicit priors from other research areas, such as top-tier 2D human generators and 3D human reconstruction methods. The authors propose that by leveraging these richer priors, compared to just using a SMPL model like previous work, their method can achieve higher quality 3D human generation.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel neural scheme called HumanGen to generate radiance fields for 3D humans using priors from 2D generation and 3D reconstruction models. This allows generating humans with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents HumanGen, a novel neural scheme to generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images. 

2. It proposes a hybrid feature representation using an anchor image generated by a 2D generator to bridge the latent space with existing 2D generators.

3. It designs a pronged network with separate geometry and appearance branches. The geometry branch utilizes a pretrained 3D reconstructor to provide fine details. 

4. It introduces an implicit blending field and two-stage blending strategy to generate high-quality textures, incorporating details from the anchor image.

5. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results in 3D human generation with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering.

6. It shows the compatibility of HumanGen with existing 2D latent editing methods by editing the anchor image.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework to leverage explicit priors from 2D generators and 3D reconstructors to achieve high-quality 3D-aware human generation with geometry details and view consistency. The use of the anchor image is critical to bridge 2D and 3D spaces.
