# [HumanGen: Generating Human Radiance Fields with Explicit Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05321)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images, with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering capabilities? 

The key hypothesis is that 3D human generation can benefit from incorporating more explicit priors from other research areas, such as top-tier 2D human generators and 3D human reconstruction methods. The authors propose that by leveraging these richer priors, compared to just using a SMPL model like previous work, their method can achieve higher quality 3D human generation.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel neural scheme called HumanGen to generate radiance fields for 3D humans using priors from 2D generation and 3D reconstruction models. This allows generating humans with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents HumanGen, a novel neural scheme to generate high-quality radiance fields for 3D humans from 2D images. 

2. It proposes a hybrid feature representation using an anchor image generated by a 2D generator to bridge the latent space with existing 2D generators.

3. It designs a pronged network with separate geometry and appearance branches. The geometry branch utilizes a pretrained 3D reconstructor to provide fine details. 

4. It introduces an implicit blending field and two-stage blending strategy to generate high-quality textures, incorporating details from the anchor image.

5. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results in 3D human generation with detailed geometry, realistic appearance, and 360° free-view rendering.

6. It shows the compatibility of HumanGen with existing 2D latent editing methods by editing the anchor image.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework to leverage explicit priors from 2D generators and 3D reconstructors to achieve high-quality 3D-aware human generation with geometry details and view consistency. The use of the anchor image is critical to bridge 2D and 3D spaces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel 3D human generation method called HumanGen that leverages explicit priors from a pre-trained 2D generator and 3D reconstructor to achieve high quality human radiance field generation with detailed geometry, photo-realistic appearance, and 360 degree free-view rendering ability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key things I notice about how this paper compares to other research on generating 3D human radiance fields:

- It focuses on generating high-quality 3D human models with realistic appearance and geometry details, allowing free-view rendering from any angle. This is an active research area, but generating detailed 3D humans remains challenging compared to other 3D contents. 

- The key novelty is leveraging explicit priors from 2D human image generators and 3D human reconstruction models. This allows incorporating strong human appearance and geometry priors rather than just relying on limited 3D supervision.

- It outperforms recent state-of-the-art 3D human generation methods like GNARF, EVA3D, and AvatarGen in terms of texture realism and geometry quality, based on quantitative metrics and visual results. The two-branch design using anchor images and fine-grained geometry supervision leads to improvements.

- It maintains compatibility with pretrained 2D GANs like StyleGAN and can leverage 2D editing techniques for controllable 3D editing. This is a useful benefit compared to training a 3D GAN from scratch.

- The training data uses a view-balanced human dataset synthesized by a 2D GAN to address dataset bias in real human images. This is a practical solution compared to methods that try to re-sample biased datasets.

- Limitations include potential bias inherited from the 2D GAN, lack of extreme out-of-distribution generalization, and no skeletal pose control. The reliance on explicit priors could restrict radical novel generations compared to a fully unconditional 3D GAN.

Overall, the paper introduces useful techniques like anchor images, geometry adaptation, and two-stage blending for high-quality 3D human generation. The results are state-of-the-art, while maintaining useful compatibility with 2D GANs. Key limitations are the need for strong explicit priors and limited generalization beyond the priors.
