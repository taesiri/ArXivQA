# [Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic   Integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to model dynamical systems across science and engineering. However, identifying parameters of ODEs that fit experimental data is challenging, especially with gradient-based methods. ODEs often have highly nonlinear dynamics leading to multiple local minima and sensitivity to initial conditions during optimization. This makes gradient-based parameter estimation unreliable.

Recently, probabilistic numerical methods like "Fenrir" have been proposed to improve gradient-based parameter fitting for ODEs. However, the authors find that Fenrir also struggles with more complex ODEs, requiring many restarts to avoid local minima.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose "diffusion tempering", a new regularization technique to improve convergence for gradient-based parameter optimization of ODEs. 

The key idea is to leverage Fenrir's "diffusion" parameter, which controls uncertainty in the numerical ODE solution. High diffusion smooths the loss landscape, avoiding local minima, while low diffusion focuses on the true parameters.

The authors use a tempering schedule, iteratively solving smoothed versions of the optimization problem with decreasing diffusion. Each solution initializes the next optimization with lower diffusion, closing in on the true parameters.

Contributions:

- Identify the "diffusion" parameter in Fenrir as a regularization hyperparameter trading off data fit vs ODE fit
- Propose "diffusion tempering" method with tempering schedule for this parameter 
- Show diffusion tempering avoids local minima on a pendulum ODE
- Demonstrate improved convergence over Fenrir and classic least-squares for several ODEs
- Enable gradient-based parameter estimation for a 6-parameter Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model

In summary, the paper presents diffusion tempering to significantly improve reliability of gradient-based parameter estimation for challenging ODE models. The proposed method outperforms prior techniques and enables parameter fitting for complex models with many local minima.
