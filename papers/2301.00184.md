# [Cap4Video: What Can Auxiliary Captions Do for Text-Video Retrieval?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00184)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we leverage auxiliary captions, automatically generated by large language models, to enhance existing text-video retrieval methods?

Specifically, the paper proposes and investigates the following hypotheses:

1) Auxiliary captions generated for offline videos can be used to augment training data as additional positive text-video pairs. 

2) Cross-modal feature interaction between videos and generated captions can help produce more discriminative video representations.

3) Query-caption matching can complement query-video matching to improve text-video retrieval performance. 

The overall goal is to develop a framework called Cap4Video that makes maximal use of automatically generated captions to improve existing text-video retrieval paradigms based on end-to-end cross-modal matching between videos and textual queries. The paper presents a novel exploration of leveraging knowledge from large pre-trained language models to benefit video-language learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel problem of leveraging automatically generated captions to enhance text-video retrieval. Instead of relying on manual annotations or crawling titles, the authors investigate using captions generated by large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2.

2. Introducing Cap4Video, a new framework to maximize the utility of generated captions in three ways - as additional training data, for cross-modal feature interaction, and for complementary query-caption matching.

3. Performing extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Cap4Video achieves significant improvements in text-video retrieval accuracy over previous methods on MSR-VTT, VATEX, MSVD and DiDeMo datasets.

In summary, this paper explores a new direction of exploiting knowledge from pre-trained LLMs to generate informative captions for offline videos, without any extra training. It then effectively utilizes these captions to improve existing text-video retrieval mechanisms through data augmentation, feature enhancement and output score fusion. The consistent gains verify the efficacy of their proposed paradigm.
