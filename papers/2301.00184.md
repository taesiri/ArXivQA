# [Cap4Video: What Can Auxiliary Captions Do for Text-Video Retrieval?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00184)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we leverage auxiliary captions, automatically generated by large language models, to enhance existing text-video retrieval methods?

Specifically, the paper proposes and investigates the following hypotheses:

1) Auxiliary captions generated for offline videos can be used to augment training data as additional positive text-video pairs. 

2) Cross-modal feature interaction between videos and generated captions can help produce more discriminative video representations.

3) Query-caption matching can complement query-video matching to improve text-video retrieval performance. 

The overall goal is to develop a framework called Cap4Video that makes maximal use of automatically generated captions to improve existing text-video retrieval paradigms based on end-to-end cross-modal matching between videos and textual queries. The paper presents a novel exploration of leveraging knowledge from large pre-trained language models to benefit video-language learning.
