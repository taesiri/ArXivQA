# [ContextGPT: Infusing LLMs Knowledge into Neuro-Symbolic Activity   Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Human activity recognition (HAR) using sensors on mobile devices is an important research area but suffers from needing large labeled datasets to train supervised models. 
- Neuro-symbolic AI methods have been proposed that infuse knowledge into models to reduce reliance on big training datasets, but existing methods rely on hand-crafted knowledge bases like ontologies that require significant human effort to build and maintain.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ContextGPT, a novel neuro-symbolic method that retrieves commonsense knowledge about activities and contexts from large language models (LLMs) instead of human-created knowledge bases. 
- ContextGPT uses prompt engineering to query a LLM about what activities are compatible with a given context description. It requires designing a system prompt, mapping contexts to text, and providing some examples.
- The retrieved knowledge is infused into a neural network-based HAR model via a knowledge infusion layer to guide the model's predictions.

Main Contributions:
- A new way to obtain commonsense activity-context knowledge from LLMs with lower human effort compared to building full ontologies.
- A prompt engineering approach to query LLMs about plausible activities for given contexts.
- Infusion of the LLM-based knowledge into a neuro-symbolic HAR model.
- Evaluation on two public datasets showing ContextGPT reaches similar and sometimes better performance than ontology-based methods.
- Analysis showing knowledge infusion is especially beneficial in low data regimes and for context-dependent activities.
- Demonstration that LLM knowledge can effectively replace hand-engineered knowledge bases in neuro-symbolic systems.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates ContextGPT, a novel method to obtain contextual knowledge from LLMs to mitigate limited training data in mobile sensor-based human activity recognition via neuro-symbolic models. The key advantage is reducing human effort while still improving model accuracy.
