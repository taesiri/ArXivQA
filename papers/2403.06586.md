# [ContextGPT: Infusing LLMs Knowledge into Neuro-Symbolic Activity   Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Human activity recognition (HAR) using sensors on mobile devices is an important research area but suffers from needing large labeled datasets to train supervised models. 
- Neuro-symbolic AI methods have been proposed that infuse knowledge into models to reduce reliance on big training datasets, but existing methods rely on hand-crafted knowledge bases like ontologies that require significant human effort to build and maintain.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ContextGPT, a novel neuro-symbolic method that retrieves commonsense knowledge about activities and contexts from large language models (LLMs) instead of human-created knowledge bases. 
- ContextGPT uses prompt engineering to query a LLM about what activities are compatible with a given context description. It requires designing a system prompt, mapping contexts to text, and providing some examples.
- The retrieved knowledge is infused into a neural network-based HAR model via a knowledge infusion layer to guide the model's predictions.

Main Contributions:
- A new way to obtain commonsense activity-context knowledge from LLMs with lower human effort compared to building full ontologies.
- A prompt engineering approach to query LLMs about plausible activities for given contexts.
- Infusion of the LLM-based knowledge into a neuro-symbolic HAR model.
- Evaluation on two public datasets showing ContextGPT reaches similar and sometimes better performance than ontology-based methods.
- Analysis showing knowledge infusion is especially beneficial in low data regimes and for context-dependent activities.
- Demonstration that LLM knowledge can effectively replace hand-engineered knowledge bases in neuro-symbolic systems.

In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates ContextGPT, a novel method to obtain contextual knowledge from LLMs to mitigate limited training data in mobile sensor-based human activity recognition via neuro-symbolic models. The key advantage is reducing human effort while still improving model accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ContextGPT, a novel prompt engineering approach that leverages large language models to retrieve commonsense knowledge about human activities and infuse it into neuro-symbolic models for human activity recognition to mitigate labeled data scarcity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ContextGPT, a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve common-sense knowledge about the relationships between human activities and contexts from large language models (LLMs). This knowledge is then infused into a neuro-symbolic model for context-aware human activity recognition to mitigate labeled data scarcity. The key aspects of ContextGPT include:

1) Using natural language prompts to query LLMs to determine which activities are compatible with a given user context description. This avoids the need to manually build complex logical knowledge models like ontologies.

2) A prompt engineering methodology involving a system message, context-to-text translation, and an example pool. This requires less expertise than building ontologies.

3) An example selection strategy to pick the most relevant examples to include in the prompt based on context similarity.

4) Infusing the LLM's knowledge about consistent activities into a neuro-symbolic model using a dedicated knowledge infusion layer.

The paper shows through extensive experiments on two public datasets that infusing ContextGPT knowledge leads to competitive recognition accuracy compared to using ontologies, while requiring significantly less human effort. This demonstrates the promise of using LLMs over logic-based methods for knowledge infusion to mitigate data scarcity in context-aware HAR.

The paper proposes a novel prompt engineering approach called "ContextGPT" to retrieve common-sense knowledge about human activities from large language models. This knowledge is then infused into neuro-symbolic models for human activity recognition to help mitigate the problem of limited labeled training data. The approach is evaluated on two public datasets and shown to achieve competitive performance to logic-based methods with significantly reduced human effort.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using prompt engineering to translate context data into natural language descriptions that can be provided as input to large language models (LLMs). What are some of the key challenges and considerations when designing effective prompts and natural language descriptions for LLMs? 

2. The paper uses a "system message" as part of the prompt to provide instructions to the LLM on the task to be performed. What factors should be considered when designing an effective system message? How might the wording impact the LLM's ability to provide accurate and relevant outputs?

3. The paperRetrieve discusses including a few carefully selected examples in the prompts to demonstrate to the LLM how the task should be performed (few-shot learning). What strategies could be used to build a diverse and representative pool of examples? How might the number and diversity of examples impact model performance?

4. The paper uses cosine similarity between context embeddings to select the most relevant examples to include in each prompt. What alternative methods could be used for relevant example selection? What are the tradeoffs between different selection strategies?

5. How robust is the proposed method to variations in how the context data is translated into natural language descriptions? Could slight differences in wording lead to very different outputs from the LLM? How could the method be made more robust?

6. Could the method proposed in this paper be extended to other application domains beyond human activity recognition? What modifications and additional considerations would be required?

7. The paper compares the proposed method against a knowledge-based ontology. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of using LLMs versus curated knowledge bases for knowledge infusion in neuro-symbolic models?

8. What steps could be taken to specialize or fine-tune the LLM to encode more domain-specific knowledge related to human activities and associated contexts? Would transfer learning help improve performance?  

9. How could personalized or individualized knowledge be incorporated into the LLM prompts proposed in this method? What challenges arise when trying to capture idiosyncratic patterns?

10. The paper assigns binary consistency scores to activities. How could fuzzy or probabilistic consistency scores be obtained instead? What modifications would need to be made to the method?
