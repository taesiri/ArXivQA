# [EAS-SNN: End-to-End Adaptive Sampling and Representation for Event-based   Detection with Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Event cameras have advantages like high temporal resolution and dynamic range but the asynchronous and sparse event data makes it challenging to process with standard neural networks. 
- Most methods do event sampling and aggregation before feeding to a detector network but the sampling is typically non-differentiable and separate from the detector optimization.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an end-to-end adaptive sampling module using recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) that integrates sampling and aggregation. 
- Sampling is done by allocating a spiking neuron per spatial location that fires when accumulated input current exceeds a threshold, triggering sampling of events since last spike time.
- Enhance training with Residual Potential Dropout (RPD) to exclude non-firing neurons and Spike-Aware Training (SAT) to improve gradient signal.
- Integrate sampling module with downstream spiking YOLOX detector for joint end-to-end training.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end learnable framework for event-based sampling and detection using SNNs.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results among spike-based methods on N-Caltech 101 and Gen1 datasets while being up to 5.85x more energy efficient.
- Proposed sampling method is generalizable and shows improved performance when applied to standard ANNs.
- Thorough analysis of sampling module behavior and impacts of RPD and SAT enhancements.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative way to do adaptive event sampling with spiking neural networks in an end-to-end trainable fashion. When integrated into a full detection pipeline, it advances the state-of-the-art for spike-based event processing.
