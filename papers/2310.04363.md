# [Amortizing intractable inference in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we use amortized Bayesian inference to enable large language models to sample from intractable posterior distributions for tasks like sequence infilling, chain-of-thought reasoning, and problem-solving with tool use?

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question appear to be:

1. Framing tasks like sequence infilling, chain-of-thought reasoning, and tool use as inference problems with intractable posteriors in latent variable models defined by a pretrained language model. 

2. Using generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to perform amortized Bayesian inference - that is, training policies to sample from intractable posteriors by matching the target distribution.

3. Initializing GFlowNet policies with pretrained language models and continuing to train them to match posteriors like p(Z|X,Y) where Z is a latent variable.

4. Empirically demonstrating that this approach enables efficient and effective sampling for tasks like sentence infilling, reasoning for classification, and arithmetic problem solving.

5. Highlighting benefits such as improved sample diversity, data efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to maximum likelihood training or policy optimization.

So in summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that amortized Bayesian inference via GFlowNets can enable language models to effectively perform tasks that involve sampling from intractable posterior distributions over sequences. The paper aims to demonstrate this through applications to reasoning, infilling, and tool use.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A general algorithm for amortized sampling from intractable posterior distributions in large language models (LLMs). The paper frames tasks like sentence infilling, chain-of-thought reasoning, and constrained text generation as inference problems involving intractable posteriors. It then shows how generative flow networks (GFlowNets) can be used to train policies that efficiently sample from these posteriors in an amortized way.

2. A probabilistic approach to fine-tuning LLMs for chain-of-thought reasoning, treating reasoning chains as latent variables in a Bayesian model. The GFlowNet training algorithm allows sampling likely reasoning chains from the posterior over latent variables conditioned on the question and answer. 

3. Empirical demonstrations on tasks including sentence continuation, story infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning chains, and integer arithmetic with tool use. The results show GFlowNet fine-tuning can improve diversity and likelihood of samples compared to likelihood training or policy optimization, while also improving sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization.

In summary, the key contribution is a method for performing efficient amortized Bayesian inference in LLMs to sample from intractable posterior distributions. This enables new capabilities like latent variable modeling for reasoning and improved performance on constrained/conditional text generation tasks. The GFlowNet fine-tuning approach is shown to be more effective than existing methods on several representative problems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The paper presents a novel method for amortized inference in large language models using generative flow networks. This represents a new approach compared to prior work on sampling from intractable posteriors in LLMs, which has focused more on MCMC or reinforcement learning methods. The use of amortized variational inference through generative modeling is a unique contribution.

- The paper connects reasoning in LLMs to inference in latent variable models. Framing chain-of-thought reasoning as posterior inference over latent reasoning chains provides a useful probabilistic perspective. While other recent work has also viewed reasoning as inference, the explicit modeling as a latent variable model and use of amortized variational inference to sample reasoning chains seems novel.

- The paper demonstrates strong empirical results on a range of tasks including text generation, reasoning, and arithmetic problem solving. The proposed GFlowNet fine-tuning approach obtains state-of-the-art performance on tasks like story infilling and outperforms baselines on arithmetic reasoning. This provides compelling evidence for the benefits of their amortized inference approach.

- Compared to other methods that aim to improve LLM sampling diversity and coverage, like nucleus or top-k sampling, the proposed approach is more principled by directly training the model to match a target distribution. The results demonstrate both improved likelihood and diversity compared to these heuristics.

- The focus on low-data fine-tuning is timely as the field increasingly recognizes the sample efficiency challenges of large LLMs. The paper shows notable gains from amortized inference in the low-data regime across multiple experiments.

Overall, the paper makes both modeling and algorithmic contributions that appear novel compared to prior work. The results convincingly demonstrate the potential of amortized inference via generative models as a useful paradigm for improving reasoning, generalization, and sample diversity in large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating transfer and generalization across tasks, in particular building a 'universal reasoner' as a shared model for the latent variable $Z$ across different inputs $X$ from various tasks. They suggest this could improve performance and sample efficiency.

- Using a more capable base language model as the starting point for GFlowNet fine-tuning. The authors expect their method would benefit larger models even more.

- Generalizing beyond sequences as the latent variable $Z$ to richer latent structures like trees or graphs, which could be important for more complex reasoning and inference.

- Quantifying epistemic uncertainty in the predictions by drawing multiple samples from the GFlowNet policy.

- Extending probabilistic programming with language variables by using the GFlowNet framework where $Z$ are sampled 'parameters' that transform $X$ into $Y$.

- Applying structured chains of thought and extending to program synthesis and planning with learned world models.

- Improving the calibration and knowledge representation in the base language models before applying the GFlowNet inference, since it focuses on improving inference but does not directly improve the knowledge.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more general and structured latent variable models for reasoning, integrating uncertainty quantification, improving knowledge representations in the base models, and transferring these inference improvements to many different tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for sampling from intractable posterior distributions over text. LLMs like GPT-3 have vast stores of world knowledge acquired through pretraining, but querying this knowledge is limited to autoregressive sampling conditioned on a prefix. Many useful tasks involve intractable inference, like infilling missing text or generating text with constraints. The paper frames problems like chain-of-thought reasoning as inference in a latent variable model, where the reasoning steps are latent variables with an intractable posterior distribution. They use GFlowNets, which are reinforcement learning algorithms for matching target distributions, to train policies that transform an LLM into an amortized sampler for these intractable posteriors. The resulting fine-tuned LLM can be conditioned on varying inputs to perform tasks like sentence infilling, text generation with length constraints, and multi-step reasoning with improved sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning or policy optimization. Overall, the paper demonstrates how GFlowNet objectives enable principled and scalable adaptation of LLMs to perform useful forms of intractable posterior inference.

The paper proposes using generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to sample from intractable posterior distributions over sequences. LLMs like GPT-3 have a vast store of world knowledge, but querying this knowledge is limited to autoregressive sampling. Many useful tasks, like text infilling, involve intractable inference in LLMs. The authors frame chain-of-thought reasoning as a latent variable modeling problem, where the reasoning chain is a latent variable to be inferred, turning it into a Bayesian inference problem. GFlowNets, which are reinforcement learning algorithms that train policies to sample sequences proportional to a reward function, are used to perform amortized probabilistic inference. The pretrained LLM is used to initialize the GFlowNet policy, which is then trained with a reward that can be evaluated using the same LLM. This allows the LLM to be fine-tuned to sample from target posterior distributions such as the Bayesian posterior over reasoning chains. Experiments demonstrate this approach improves diversity and data efficiency compared to maximum likelihood training or policy optimization for tasks like text infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning steps, and arithmetic problem solving.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the key problem and questions it is addressing:

The paper is focused on improving the ability to perform probabilistic inference and sampling from intractable posterior distributions in large language models (LLMs). LLMs are typically trained in an autoregressive fashion, which makes sampling from the model tractable. However, many useful applications require sampling from other more complex conditional distributions in the LLM, which is intractable. 

Some specific problems and questions addressed include:

- How can we sample from intractable posterior distributions in LLMs, such as for tasks like sentence infilling, constrained text generation, and chain-of-thought reasoning? Approaches like MCMC are too slow and RL methods like PPO lead to mode collapse.

- Can we use amortized inference methods like generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to train policies that efficiently sample from these intractable LLM posterior distributions?

- Can we view chain-of-thought reasoning as inference in a latent variable model and use GFlowNets to sample reasoning chains from the posterior over latent variables?

- How can we adapt LLMs for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use by modeling them as inference problems?

- Can matching the full distribution with GFlowNet training avoid issues like mode collapse and overoptimization that affect RL methods?

- Does modeling the diversity of samples help improve performance on downstream classification or reasoning tasks compared to just maximizing the reward?

So in summary, the key focus is using amortized inference methods like GFlowNets to efficiently sample from complex multimodal posterior distributions in LLMs that arise in tasks like reasoning, infilling, and constrained text generation. This improves their applicability for probabilistic inference.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for amortized inference in large language models (LLMs) to enable sampling from intractable posterior distributions. LLMs are limited in that they can only generate text autoregressively from left to right. However, many useful applications like text infilling, constrained text generation, and reasoning with chain of thought involve sampling from complex posterior distributions that depend on both the past and future context. The paper frames these applications as inference problems in latent variable models, where the latent variable represents the chain of reasoning or infilling text. They propose using generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to perform amortized variational inference over these latent variables. Specifically, they initialize the GFlowNet with the pretrained LLM weights and continue training with a diversity-seeking reinforcement learning objective. The resulting fine-tuned LLM can be conditioned on past and future context to flexibly sample possible reasoning chains or infillings.

Empirically, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowNet fine-tuning over several applications including sentence continuation, story infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning chains, and integer arithmetic with tool use. The fine-tuned models generate more diverse samples while maintaining high likelihood compared to maximum likelihood training or policy gradient methods. The inference view also improves sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization. For example, on subjectivity classification, GFlowNet tuning achieves over 10% better accuracy than supervised fine-tuning using only 10 labeled examples. The diversity of samples is also useful for model averaging in the reasoning chain paradigm. Overall, the proposed amortized inference approach enables more flexible use of knowledge stored in LLMs for reasoning and constrained text generation tasks.
