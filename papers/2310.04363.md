# [Amortizing intractable inference in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: 

How can we perform efficient and scalable Bayesian inference over posterior distributions in large language models, in order to enable sampling for tasks like sequence infilling, constrained text generation, and chain of thought reasoning?

The key points are:

- Many useful applications of large language models involve sampling from intractable posterior distributions conditioned on various inputs or constraints. For example, infilling missing text, generating text with length or lexical constraints, and finding likely continuations all require sampling from distributions that are not tractable to compute with standard autoregressive LMs.

- The paper proposes using amortized Bayesian inference and generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to learn to sample from these intractable posteriors. By training policies to match target distributions defined by an LM's likelihoods, it enables efficient inference for downstream tasks. 

- This is framed as learning to perform reasoning by sampling latent "chains of thought" from Bayesian posteriors defined by the LM. The approach allows adapting LMs to tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use in a data-efficient and scalable way.

- Empirical results validate the approach on tasks like sentence infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning chains, and integer arithmetic with external tool use. The diversity of samples is useful for Bayesian model averaging.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that amortized inference using GFlowNets for distribution matching provides an effective way to adapt large pre-trained LMs to tasks involving intractable posterior inference and reasoning over latent variables. The experiments aim to validate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A general algorithm for amortized sampling from intractable posterior distributions in large language models. The paper frames various text generation tasks, like infilling and constrained generation, as inference problems involving intractable posterior distributions. It then shows how generative flow networks (GFlowNets) can be used to train large language models to sample efficiently from these distributions at test time. 

2. A probabilistic approach to fine-tuning LLMs for chain-of-thought reasoning. The paper interprets chain-of-thought reasoning as inference in a latent variable model, where the reasoning chain is the latent variable. It shows how GFlowNet objectives can fine-tune LLMs to sample diverse, high-likelihood reasoning chains from the posterior over chains conditioned on the question and answer.

3. Empirical demonstrations of the effectiveness of their approach on tasks like sequence continuation, sentence infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning chains, and arithmetic problem solving with tool use. Across these experiments, GFlowNet fine-tuning is shown to improve sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to maximum likelihood training or policy gradient methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a general framework and algorithm for performing amortized Bayesian inference in large language models to sample from intractable posteriors. This enables new capabilities like high-quality text generation and reasoning with diverse chains of thoughts. The paper shows strong empirical results on a variety of tasks using this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes an important contribution to research on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for improved text generation. Compared to related work, this paper has a few key differences and novelties:

1. Focus on intractable inference: Many papers fine-tune LLMs to directly maximize the likelihood of target text sequences. This paper instead focuses on the problem of intractable posterior inference in LLMs. The authors frame tasks like infilling, reasoning with latent variables, and constrained generation as inference problems involving intractable distributions.

2. Amortized inference with GFlowNet objectives: To perform inference in these intractable distributions, this paper proposes using generative flow networks (GFlowNets), a type of diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithm. GFlowNets can amortize inference by learning parameterized policies that sample from target distributions. Using GFlowNets for LLM fine-tuning provides benefits like improved sample diversity and generalization compared to likelihood maximization.

3. Applications: The paper demonstrates the approach on several interesting applications involving reasoning and tool use, like subjectivity classification with rationales and multi-step arithmetic problem solving. Framing tasks like reasoning as inference highlights the connection to probabilistic models of cognition. The results show improvements over baselines in data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization.

4. Probabilistic modeling: The paper proposes modeling chain-of-thought reasoning as inference in a latent variable model defined by the LLM. This formalism connects LLM knowledge more directly to probabilistic graphical models and Bayes nets. The GFlowNet inference scheme can be interpreted as a type of probabilistic programming.

Overall, this paper makes contributions at the intersection of two active areas - interpretability and reasoning in LLMs, and improving text generation capabilities. The proposed techniques enable sampling from distributions that are usually intractable for standard LLMs. The applications demonstrate interesting ways this approach can extend the capabilities and interpretability of large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions: 

- Investigate transfer and generalization across tasks, in particular, building a 'universal reasoner' as a model $q(Z | X)$ shared between $X$ from different tasks. This was recently considered by [Wang et al., 2023].

- Use a more capable base large language model (LLM) as a starting point for GFlowNet fine-tuning. The paper expects that conclusions would hold for larger models, and the amortized inference approach may benefit larger models more. 

- Adopt the GFlowNet formalisms to generalize to latent variables $Z$ with richer generative processes than left-to-right sampling, such as tree- or list-structured state spaces for more flexible reasoning. Related work has considered tree-structured reasoning chains [Yao et al., 2023] and graph-structured representations [Besta et al., 2023].

- Extend probabilistic programming with language variables, where GFlowNets could enable inference over these language variables. 

- Use structured chains of thought beyond strings of tokens, building on the view of GFlowNets as variational inference over structured latent variables.

- Apply the approach to program synthesis and planning with world models, extending the reasoning capacities demonstrated to more complex tasks.

In summary, the paper suggests directions involving transferring the approach across tasks, using it with more capable base models, generalizing the latent variable structure, and applying it to more complex reasoning and programming tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an approach to amortizing intractable inference in large language models (LLMs) using generative flow networks (GFlowNets). Large language models are powerful compressors of knowledge, but querying this knowledge is limited to autoregressive sampling. Many useful tasks like text infilling, constrained generation, and reasoning require sampling from intractable posteriors. The authors address this by fine-tuning LLMs with GFlowNet objectives, which train policies to sample sequences with probability proportional to a reward like the joint probability under the LLM. This allows matching target distributions like Bayesian posteriors for inference. Experiments validate the approach on tasks like sentence continuation, story infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning chains, and arithmetic problem solving with external tools. Key benefits include improved sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to maximum likelihood training or policy optimization. The diversity resulting from modeling the full posterior also helps in aggregating multiple solutions. Overall, the work demonstrates how GFlowNet fine-tuning can enable principled and scalable amortized inference for sampling from intractable distributions in large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for sampling from intractable posterior distributions over text. LLMs like GPT-3 have vast amounts of world knowledge encoded in them, but querying this knowledge is limited to autoregressive sampling conditioned on a prefix. Many useful applications, like text infilling, constrained text generation, and chain-of-thought reasoning, require sampling from intractable distributions. The paper shows these can be framed as inference problems in a latent variable model, where the latent variable captures an underlying reasoning process. While methods like MCMC are too slow, reward-maximizing reinforcement learning like PPO suffer from mode collapse. Instead, the authors propose using GFlowNets to perform amortized variational inference by training a flow-based policy to directly match the target posterior distribution. This policy is initialized from the pretrained LLM and fine-tuned.

The authors demonstrate GFlowNet fine-tuning enables sampling from intractable posteriors for applications like sentence continuation, story infilling, subjectivity classification via latent reasoning chains, and multi-step arithmetic problem solving using an external tool (calculator). The diversity of samples from GFlowNet policies help improve few-shot classification accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning and PPO. Overall, the paper shows GFlowNet fine-tuning provides an effective algorithm for performing tractable Bayesian inference in LLMs for improving sample efficiency and generalization on downstream tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to perform amortized Bayesian inference in autoregressive language models. GFlowNets are reinforcement learning algorithms that train policies to sample from a target distribution defined by an unnormalized density (reward function). The key idea is to initialize the GFlowNet policy with a pretrained language model, and continue training it with a reward function that can be evaluated with the same language model. For example, to perform inference over latent reasoning chains, the GFlowNet policy is initialized as an autoregressive LM conditioned on the input text. It is then trained to sample latent token sequences that maximize the joint probability under the original LM of the input, latent sequence, and output. This allows the fine-tuned GFlowNet to generate diverse samples from the intractable posterior distribution over latent sequences given the input and output. Experiments demonstrate that GFlowNet fine-tuning improves sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to maximum likelihood training or policy optimization, enabling improved performance on tasks like sequence continuation, reasoning, and arithmetic problem solving.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the authors are trying to address the issue of performing efficient and scalable probabilistic inference in large language models. 

Some key points:

- Large language models like GPT-3 are trained in an autoregressive manner which makes sampling easy. But many useful tasks require posterior inference which is intractable in these models. 

- Tasks like text infilling, constrained text generation, reasoning, etc. require sampling from complex conditional distributions which are intractable in large LMs.

- Current approaches like MCMC, RL, etc. have limitations in terms of efficiency, scalability or mode collapse issues. 

- The authors propose using amortized variational inference with generative flow networks to learn to sample from these complex posteriors in an efficient and scalable way.

- Their method initializes the flow policy network with the pretrained LM and trains it to match the target posterior distribution using a modified generative flow objective. 

- This allows transforming the pretrained LM into an efficient specialized sampler for task-specific posteriors without requiring much additional data.

- They showcase this approach on tasks like sequence infilling, subjectivity classification with reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning with external tool use. The results demonstrate improved sample efficiency and generalization compared to baselines.

In summary, the core issue is performing scalable and accurate posterior inference in large LMs for complex conditional sampling tasks, and the authors propose an amortized inference approach using generative flows to tackle this problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Autoregressive language models - The paper focuses on autoregressive large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, which model sequences by decomposing the joint probability over tokens into a product of conditional distributions. 

- Intractable inference - Many useful tasks with LLMs actually require sampling from intractable posterior distributions, rather than just unconditional generation. The paper frames tasks like infilling and constrained generation as problems of intractable inference.

- Amortized inference - To efficiently sample from intractable LLM posteriors, the authors propose using amortized inference techniques like generative flow networks (GFlowNets). These allow training neural inference networks to approximate desired distributions.

- Diversity-seeking fine-tuning - GFlowNets are trained with diversity-seeking objectives to match target distributions, rather than maximize likelihood or reward. This avoids issues like mode collapse.

- Chain-of-thought reasoning - The paper models reasoning in LLMs through latent variable models. Chain-of-thought reasoning is framed as posterior inference over reasoning steps. 

- Tool use - Another application is multi-step arithmetic reasoning and planning tool use sequences. This tests generalization and benefits from aggregating diverse samples.

In summary, the key focus is using amortized Bayesian inference via GFlowNet fine-tuning of LLMs to efficiently sample from intractable posterior distributions for tasks like infilling, reasoning, and constrained text generation. Modeling reasoning as inference over latent variables is another core idea.
