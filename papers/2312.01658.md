# [AGD: an Auto-switchable Optimizer using Stepwise Gradient Difference for   Preconditioning Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have shown remarkable success in deep learning. A key component is the preconditioning matrix that provides enhanced gradient information and regulates the step size along each dimension. However, computing the full Hessian matrix to approximate the curvature is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, it is important to design the preconditioning matrix to balance approximation accuracy and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel optimizer called AGD that enhances the approximation of curvature information and enables automatic switching between SGD and adaptive optimization. 

The key ideas are:

1) Approximate the diagonal Hessian using the difference between gradients of two successive steps. This serves as the inner product between the Hessian row vectors and difference of parameters.

2) Introduce an auto-switching capability to toggle the preconditioning matrix between SGD and adaptive optimizer, governed by a threshold hyperparameter. This allows seamless switching on a per-parameter basis during training.

Main Contributions:

- Proposed a new optimizer AGD that efficiently approximates curvature via gradient differences and automatically switches between SGD and adaptive modes.

- Provided theoretical analysis to establish convergence guarantees for AGD in both non-convex and convex settings.  

- Performed comprehensive experiments on 6 datasets across NLP, CV and Recommendation tasks. Results demonstrate AGD achieves highly competitive or significantly better performance than state-of-the-art optimizers.

- Analyzed the auto-switching mechanism to understand how AGD transitions between SGD and adaptive optimizer, and the impact of key hyperparameter controlling this process.

In summary, the paper presented a novel optimizer AGD with gradient difference based approximation of curvature information and automatic switching capability. Both theoretical and empirical results prove its superiority over existing methods across diverse deep learning tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel optimizer called AGD, which efficiently and effectively integrates the information of the Hessian into the preconditioning matrix and switches dynamically between SGD and the adaptive optimizer.

2. Establishing theoretical convergence guarantees for AGD in both non-convex and convex stochastic settings. 

3. Validating AGD extensively on six public datasets across three domains (NLP, CV, and RecSys). The experimental results demonstrate that AGD outperforms or is highly competitive with state-of-the-art optimizers.

4. Analyzing how AGD is able to automatically switch between SGD and adaptive optimization based on the threshold hyperparameter delta, and assessing its impact on the training process across different tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the AGD method proposed in this paper:

1. The key idea of AGD is to utilize the gradient difference between successive steps to approximate the Hessian information. Why is the gradient difference a reasonable approximation and how is it related to the Hessian theoretically?

2. In the auto-switch mechanism, AGD toggles between SGD and adaptive steps based on the threshold $\delta$. What is the intuition behind this and how does tuning $\delta$ impact optimization performance? 

3. The paper shows AGD achieves strong performance across CV, NLP, and RecSys tasks. What aspects of the method make it adaptable to such diverse applications? How could it be extended to additional domains?

4. Convergence analysis is provided for both non-convex and convex settings. What assumptions are made in these analyses? Are they reasonable and what happens if they are violated?  

5. How does the adaptive learning rate in AGD differ from other adaptive methods like Adam and AdaBelief? What impact does this have?

6. Could second-order information be explicitly incorporated into AGD instead of the gradient difference approximation? What would be the trade-offs of doing so?

7. The auto-switch idea stems from wanting to match SGD and adaptive steps to different training stages. Are there other criteria besides $\delta$ that could govern this switching?

8. The paper shows AGD achieving state-of-the-art performance across the tested tasks. Are there situations where we would expect it to underperform? 

9. AGD introduces several new hyperparameters like $\delta$. How sensitive is performance to the settings of these parameters?

10. The gradient difference in AGD provides local curvature information. Could global curvature approximations also be viable? What are relative merits?
