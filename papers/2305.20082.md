# [Control4D: Dynamic Portrait Editing by Learning 4D GAN from 2D   Diffusion-based Editor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-fidelity and temporally consistent editing of dynamic 4D portraits using only text instructions as input. The key hypothesis is that by building upon an efficient 4D scene representation (Tensor4D) and incorporating a 2D diffusion-based editor (ControlNet), the proposed Control4D approach can achieve photorealistic and spatiotemporally consistent 4D portrait editing through learning a continuous 4D GAN from the inconsistent supervision of the 2D editor.In particular, the paper hypothesizes that:- Using Tensor4D as a compact 4D scene representation provides an effective basis for high-fidelity 4D editing.- Employing ControlNet, a diffusion-based editor, enables iterative image modification guided by text prompts. - Learning a 4D GAN from ControlNet, instead of using its inconsistent supervision directly, allows capturing a more continuous editing space for temporally coherent results.- Extracting multi-level guidance from edited images facilitates stable GAN training.Through experiments on diverse 4D portrait data, the paper aims to validate these hypotheses and demonstrate Control4D's capabilities for photorealistic and spatiotemporally consistent text-guided 4D portrait editing.

The key hypothesis is that by building upon an efficient 4D scene representation (Tensor4D) and learning a 4D GAN from a 2D diffusion-based editor, the proposed Control4D method can achieve photorealistic and spatiotemporally consistent editing of dynamic 4D portraits specified by just text prompts.In summary, the core research focus is developing a novel approach (Control4D) for text-driven editing of 4D dynamic portrait scenes that can produce high quality results with both photorealism and temporal consistency. The key ideas involve using Tensor4D for efficient 4D scene representation, learning a 4D GAN from a 2D diffusion editor to avoid inconsistent supervisions, and employing multi-level guidance for stable training.
