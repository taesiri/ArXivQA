# [Control4D: Dynamic Portrait Editing by Learning 4D GAN from 2D   Diffusion-based Editor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-fidelity and temporally consistent editing of dynamic 4D portraits using only text instructions as input. The key hypothesis is that by building upon an efficient 4D scene representation (Tensor4D) and incorporating a 2D diffusion-based editor (ControlNet), the proposed Control4D approach can achieve photorealistic and spatiotemporally consistent 4D portrait editing through learning a continuous 4D GAN from the inconsistent supervision of the 2D editor.In particular, the paper hypothesizes that:- Using Tensor4D as a compact 4D scene representation provides an effective basis for high-fidelity 4D editing.- Employing ControlNet, a diffusion-based editor, enables iterative image modification guided by text prompts. - Learning a 4D GAN from ControlNet, instead of using its inconsistent supervision directly, allows capturing a more continuous editing space for temporally coherent results.- Extracting multi-level guidance from edited images facilitates stable GAN training.Through experiments on diverse 4D portrait data, the paper aims to validate these hypotheses and demonstrate Control4D's capabilities for photorealistic and spatiotemporally consistent text-guided 4D portrait editing.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-fidelity and temporally consistent editing of 4D dynamic portrait scenes using only text instructions as input. The key hypothesis is that by building upon an efficient 4D scene representation (Tensor4D) and learning a 4D GAN from a 2D diffusion-based editor, the proposed Control4D method can achieve photorealistic and spatiotemporally consistent editing of dynamic 4D portraits specified by just text prompts.In summary, the core research focus is developing a novel approach (Control4D) for text-driven editing of 4D dynamic portrait scenes that can produce high quality results with both photorealism and temporal consistency. The key ideas involve using Tensor4D for efficient 4D scene representation, learning a 4D GAN from a 2D diffusion editor to avoid inconsistent supervisions, and employing multi-level guidance for stable training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Control4D, a novel approach for high-fidelity and temporally consistent 4D portrait editing using only text instructions. 2. It builds Control4D upon an efficient 4D scene representation (Tensor4D) and a diffusion-based editor (ControlNet). This allows high-fidelity rendering and editing.3. To achieve temporally consistent editing, it learns a 4D GAN from the 2D diffusion editor to build a more continuous 4D generation space. This avoids using inconsistent discrete supervision signals. 4. For more stable training, it extracts multi-level information from the edited images to facilitate the learning process of the generator.In summary, the key contributions are proposing Control4D for 4D portrait editing, learning a 4D GAN to achieve temporal consistency, and using multi-level cues to stabilize training. The method achieves high-fidelity, consistent 4D editing that surpasses previous approaches.
