# [LExCI: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02739)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents LExCI, an open-source framework for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents on embedded systems using the RLlib library. LExCI bridges the gap between RL software and embedded devices, allowing for easy integration of custom hardware into the RL training process. It features a master-minion architecture whereby the master handles RL training on a conventional computer while minions generate experiences on target embedded systems. Once enough data is collected, minions send it to the master for RL algorithm training. LExCI supports advanced neural network architectures and various model-free RL algorithms. Through experiments on an inverted pendulum benchmark problem, LExCI demonstrated the ability to achieve comparable performance to native RLlib while incorporating three different embedded systems, including a rapid control prototyping unit. As an open, flexible framework built on established libraries, LExCI facilitates the deployment of RL agents on real-world embedded devices without necessitating proprietary solutions. The paper validates LExCIâ€™s viability and potential for bringing together RL and embedded systems.
