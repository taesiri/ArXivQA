# [LExCI: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02739)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents LExCI, an open-source framework for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents on embedded systems using the RLlib library. LExCI bridges the gap between RL software and embedded devices, allowing for easy integration of custom hardware into the RL training process. It features a master-minion architecture whereby the master handles RL training on a conventional computer while minions generate experiences on target embedded systems. Once enough data is collected, minions send it to the master for RL algorithm training. LExCI supports advanced neural network architectures and various model-free RL algorithms. Through experiments on an inverted pendulum benchmark problem, LExCI demonstrated the ability to achieve comparable performance to native RLlib while incorporating three different embedded systems, including a rapid control prototyping unit. As an open, flexible framework built on established libraries, LExCI facilitates the deployment of RL agents on real-world embedded devices without necessitating proprietary solutions. The paper validates LExCIâ€™s viability and potential for bringing together RL and embedded systems.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting LExCI, an open-source framework that allows training reinforcement learning (RL) agents using libraries like RLlib when execution happens on embedded systems, while training takes place on a separate machine. The key highlights of LExCI include:

- It is a free, general-purpose RL framework building on established libraries like RLlib and TensorFlow.

- It enables training RL agents on embedded devices by bridging the gap between training on a regular machine and inference on resource-constrained hardware. 

- It provides out-of-the-box support for complex neural network architectures like RNNs and CNNs.

- It is compatible with different RL algorithms, both on-policy and off-policy. 

- It offers helper classes to simplify interfacing with control software and hardware like rapid control prototyping systems.

- Its architecture lends itself well to parallelization during the data collection process.

In essence, the main contribution is a flexible open-source framework to facilitate deployment and training of RL agents on embedded systems, overcoming challenges faced previously in this area.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising technique for developing optimal controllers and policies for complex systems. However, integrating RL agents into real-world systems like embedded devices faces challenges. Conventional RL libraries have dependencies and resource requirements not suitable for embedded systems with constraints on size, power, real-time performance etc. Manually re-implementing models is tedious. Thus, there is a need for a framework that enables easy training and deployment of RL agents on embedded devices.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose LExCI - the Learning and Experiencing Cycle Interface - an open-source framework for training RL agents using RLlib that can execute on embedded devices. Key aspects:

- Separates learning side (LExCI Master) from data generation side with embedded device (LExCI Minion)
- Supports neural network models in TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite Micro for learning and execution
- Automates model conversion and deployment to embedded device
- Parallelizable architecture for faster data generation
- Helper classes to interface with control software like Simulink, ControlDesk etc.
- Out-of-box support for elaborate network architectures and on-policy/off-policy RL algorithms

Main Contributions:

- LExCI provides a flexible, free and general-purpose framework for model-free RL on embedded systems
- Automates tedious parts of model conversion, training, deployment
- Enables easy adoption of advanced RL techniques by non-experts through integration with established libraries like RLlib
- Demonstrated performance on par with native RLlib for PPO and DDPG on three platforms - Python, Simulink and an automotive rapid control prototyping system
- Framework extended in other works for industrial use-cases like engine emission control

In summary, LExCI simplifies training and deployment of RL policies on resource-constrained embedded devices by interfacing them with popular RL libraries. Its modular architecture should facilitate extensions to newer algorithms, hardware platforms and use-cases in future.
