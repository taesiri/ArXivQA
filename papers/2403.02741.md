# [State-Constrained Zero-Sum Differential Games with One-Sided Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided information. Specifically, Player 1 has private information about his "type" that determines the payoffs, while Player 2 does not have this information. The players control a dynamical system with state constraints. Player 1 aims to minimize his expected payoff without violating constraints, while Player 2 aims to maximize payoff and may violate constraints. The paper proves value existence for such games and derives subdynamic programming principles to compute equilibrium behavioral strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- Extends existing differential game theory to handle one-sided information and state constraints by proving value existence and deriving primal and dual Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Value is convex in belief.
- Player 1's strategy convexifies value over belief simplex to optimize payoff. This splits belief to vertices, enabling Player 1 to manipulate belief and take advantage of private information. 
- Player 2 plays a dual game defined by the conjugate value function. Her strategy counters Player 1's manipulation.
- Develops numerical methods to solve high-dimensional problems by approximating backward reachable set and using input convex networks to handle value discontinuities.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical contribution: Extends differential game theory to settings with one-sided information and state constraints by proving value existence and deriving subdynamic programming principles. Reveals belief manipulation behaviors.
- Computational contribution: Develops physics-informed neural networks and input convex networks to approximate discontinuous values and high-dimensional backward reachable sets to alleviate curse of dimensionality.
- Application contribution: Applies theory and algorithms to a simplified football game. Reveals configurations where the informed player can manipulate belief via fake moves and how the uninformed player responds.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed theoretical and computational solutions, and the main contributions made. It describes the technical content at a high-level without going into mathematical details, in a way that provides useful insight into the paper for a human reader.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided information, proves the existence of value, derives primal and dual subdynamic programming principles for computing player strategies, and develops numerical methods to approximate values and synthesize strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Extending the theory of zero-sum differential games with one-sided information to games with state constraints by proving value existence and deriving the primal and dual subdynamic principles.

2. Elucidating, with detailed examples, how the subdynamic principles lead to the derivation of behavioral strategies. 

3. Developing numerical tools to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in value approximation and to infer behavioral strategies from values. Specifically, using a physics-informed neural network to characterize the backward reachable set for smoothing value approximation, and using an input convex network to predict convex values.

4. Solving an 8D man-to-man matchup game as a case study to reveal player positions in which the attacker can take advantage of information asymmetry by playing specific random (and fake) moves, and deriving the defender's best response given the lack of information.

The paper studies zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided information, where one player has private information about their type or intent. It proves the existence of value functions for these games and derives principles to compute behavioral strategies that manipulate beliefs. Key concepts include using convexity of value functions, subdynamic programming to derive optimal controls, solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations with neural networks, and revealing how the informed player delays information release or splits beliefs to optimize outcomes. The overall focus is on understanding the mechanisms behind behavior strategies resulting from information asymmetry and constraints.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper extends the theory of zero-sum differential games with one-sided information to incorporate state constraints. Can you explain in detail how the proof of value existence had to be adapted to account for state constraints? 

2. The paper shows that introducing state constraints changes the minimax solutions, convex hulls of the value function, and thus the behavioral strategies. Can you walk through a specific example illustrating these changes compared to the unconstrained setting?

3. The paper discusses using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to characterize the backward reachable set and handle value discontinuities. What are the specific advantages of using a PINN here compared to other function approximators? 

4. When approximating the primal and dual values, the paper convexifies the values with respect to belief/dual variables $p$ and $\hat{p}$. Can you explain why convexification is necessary and what impact it has on the behavioral strategies?  

5. The formulation leads to a belief space Hamilton-Jacobi equation. What are some of the major computational challenges in solving such an HJI equation and how does the proposed method aim to address them?

6. The paper emphasizes understanding whether and how beliefs should be manipulated based on the value landscape. What specific insights does the method provide into optimal belief manipulation strategies? 

7. How does the concept of a "dual game" help derive the behavioral strategy for the uninformed player? Can you walk through the details?

8. Proposition 3 provides an error bound for the convexification operation. Can you explain the proof technique and discuss if tighter bounds can be derived?  

9. The case study reveals player positions where the informed attacker can take advantage of information asymmetry. What specific "fake moves" emerge and how does the defender respond?

10. The method computes primal and dual value functions. Can you compare and contrast the approximations - which one was more challenging and why?
