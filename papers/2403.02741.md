# [State-Constrained Zero-Sum Differential Games with One-Sided Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided information. Specifically, Player 1 has private information about his "type" that determines the payoffs, while Player 2 does not have this information. The players control a dynamical system with state constraints. Player 1 aims to minimize his expected payoff without violating constraints, while Player 2 aims to maximize payoff and may violate constraints. The paper proves value existence for such games and derives subdynamic programming principles to compute equilibrium behavioral strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- Extends existing differential game theory to handle one-sided information and state constraints by proving value existence and deriving primal and dual Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Value is convex in belief.
- Player 1's strategy convexifies value over belief simplex to optimize payoff. This splits belief to vertices, enabling Player 1 to manipulate belief and take advantage of private information. 
- Player 2 plays a dual game defined by the conjugate value function. Her strategy counters Player 1's manipulation.
- Develops numerical methods to solve high-dimensional problems by approximating backward reachable set and using input convex networks to handle value discontinuities.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical contribution: Extends differential game theory to settings with one-sided information and state constraints by proving value existence and deriving subdynamic programming principles. Reveals belief manipulation behaviors.
- Computational contribution: Develops physics-informed neural networks and input convex networks to approximate discontinuous values and high-dimensional backward reachable sets to alleviate curse of dimensionality.
- Application contribution: Applies theory and algorithms to a simplified football game. Reveals configurations where the informed player can manipulate belief via fake moves and how the uninformed player responds.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed theoretical and computational solutions, and the main contributions made. It describes the technical content at a high-level without going into mathematical details, in a way that provides useful insight into the paper for a human reader.
