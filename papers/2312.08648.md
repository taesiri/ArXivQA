# [CLIP-guided Federated Learning on Heterogeneous and Long-Tailed Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08648)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel federated learning method called CLIP-guided Federated Learning (CLIP2FL) to address the key challenges of heterogeneity and class imbalance in federated learning. The method utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model to guide both client-side and server-side learning. On the client-side, knowledge distillation from CLIP to local models is conducted to improve their feature representations. On the server-side, CLIP's text encoder outputs are used as prototypes in a contrastive loss to optimize generated federated features. These features are used to retrain a balanced server classifier. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet long-tailed datasets demonstrate that CLIP2FL outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods, especially for few-shot tail classes. The improvements validate that transferring CLIP's rich vision-language knowledge effectively mitigates bias and heterogeneity issues in federated learning.
