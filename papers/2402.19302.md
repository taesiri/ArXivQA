# [DiffAssemble: A Unified Graph-Diffusion Model for 2D and 3D Reassembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reassembly tasks like solving jigsaw puzzles or reconstructing 3D objects from fragments play an important role in fields like computer vision and robotics. However, existing methods typically address 2D puzzles and 3D object reassembly separately despite their similarities. A unified approach that can handle both effectively is lacking.   

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes DiffAssemble, a unified graph-based neural network model to solve 2D and 3D reassembly tasks. The key ideas are:

1) Represent puzzle pieces or object fragments as nodes in a graph with features encoding appearance and pose.

2) Formulate the task as iteratively denoising piece poses over time using a diffusion probabilistic model. This injects noise into poses and trains the model to reverse this and reconstruct original poses.

3) Use an attention-based graph neural network conditioned on input features to refine piece poses over multiple denoising steps. 

4) Employ a sparsification technique to scale to puzzles with hundreds of pieces.

Main Contributions:

1) State-of-the-art performance on 2D jigsaw puzzles and 3D object reassembly tasks using one unified approach.

2) First learning method to handle 2D puzzles with both shifted and rotated pieces.

3) Robust performance on puzzles with missing pieces compared to optimization methods.

4) Much faster runtime than optimization methods, solving 900 piece puzzles in 5 seconds compared to 55 seconds.

5) Ablation studies validate design choices like graph formulation, diffusion modeling, equivariant features etc.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel unified framework for tackling 2D and 3D reassembly tasks using graphs and diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art across both domains. The shared representation indicates commonalities between these tasks.
