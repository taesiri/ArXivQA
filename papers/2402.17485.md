# [EMO: Emote Portrait Alive - Generating Expressive Portrait Videos with   Audio2Video Diffusion Model under Weak Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic and expressive talking head videos from a single image remains challenging. Traditional methods often rely on intermediate 3D representations like facial landmarks or blendshapes to simplify the task, but this constrains expressiveness. Recent diffusion model-based approaches improve quality but still have limitations in capturing nuanced facial expressions synchronized with audio.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes EMO, a novel audio-to-video talking head generation framework powered by diffusion models. It takes a single portrait image and audio as input to directly generate a talking video, bypassing intermediate 3D representations. The key components are:

1) Backbone Network - A diffusion model backbone adapted from Stable Diffusion with temporal modules for smooth frame transitions.

2) ReferenceNet - Extracts identity-preserving portrait features for the backbone network. 

3) Audio Encoder - Encodes audio features to drive expressive facial animations.

4) Weak Control Signals - Face region mask and speed layers provide stability without compromising expressiveness.

The model is trained on a large-scale 250-hour talking head video dataset. A multi-stage strategy is used, pretraining image and video separately before fine-tuning control signals.

Main Contributions:

- Direct audio-to-video talking head generation without constrained intermediate representations
- Facial expression quality far surpassing state-of-the-art methods, even for singing
- Stable identity-preserving generation for long 1-minute clips 
- Applicable to diverse portrait styles despite training only on real images
- New quantitative metric E-FID to measure expression quality

The results showcase significant improvements in talking head video realism, expressiveness and stability at longer durations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
