# [DEEM: Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling for Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent work has shown promising results in using large language models (LLMs) for stance detection. However, stance detection requires nuanced domain knowledge that vanilla reasoning approaches may fail to capture, leading to potential inaccuracies. Hence, there is room for improvement in terms of how LLMs leverage their generative capabilities to simulate domain experts and reason about stance.

Method: 
The paper proposes a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling (DEEM) approach. Unlike existing multi-agent methods requiring manual expert specification, DEEM automatically generates diverse experts from labeled training data. It then filters reliable, experienced experts using frequency and accuracy heuristics. For a new test sentence, relevant experts are retrieved based on similarity and prompted to collaboratively predict stance.   

Key Ideas:
- Generate candidate experts by prompting LLMs with few labeled instances 
- Filter experienced experts based on total occurrence and response accuracy
- Construct repository of sentence-expert pairs  
- Retrieve top similar experts for new test sentence input
- Use retrieved experts in prompt to predict stance 

Main Results:
- Outperforms previous SoTA methods on 3 standard stance detection benchmarks 
- More accurate than self-consistency based reasoning
- Shows potential for mitigating stance bias in LLMs  

Key Benefits:
- Automates expert modeling using training data  
- Dynamic retrieval finds context-relevant experts
- Aggregates perspectives from multiple experts
- Reduces hallucinations from inappropriate experts

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to automatically leverage LLMs' generative capacity to create an ensemble of experienced experts that can provide reliable situational reasoning for stance detection. The semi-parametric retrieval approach also adapts reasoning to the specific test context.
