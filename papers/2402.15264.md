# [DEEM: Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling for Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent work has shown promising results in using large language models (LLMs) for stance detection. However, stance detection requires nuanced domain knowledge that vanilla reasoning approaches may fail to capture, leading to potential inaccuracies. Hence, there is room for improvement in terms of how LLMs leverage their generative capabilities to simulate domain experts and reason about stance.

Method: 
The paper proposes a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling (DEEM) approach. Unlike existing multi-agent methods requiring manual expert specification, DEEM automatically generates diverse experts from labeled training data. It then filters reliable, experienced experts using frequency and accuracy heuristics. For a new test sentence, relevant experts are retrieved based on similarity and prompted to collaboratively predict stance.   

Key Ideas:
- Generate candidate experts by prompting LLMs with few labeled instances 
- Filter experienced experts based on total occurrence and response accuracy
- Construct repository of sentence-expert pairs  
- Retrieve top similar experts for new test sentence input
- Use retrieved experts in prompt to predict stance 

Main Results:
- Outperforms previous SoTA methods on 3 standard stance detection benchmarks 
- More accurate than self-consistency based reasoning
- Shows potential for mitigating stance bias in LLMs  

Key Benefits:
- Automates expert modeling using training data  
- Dynamic retrieval finds context-relevant experts
- Aggregates perspectives from multiple experts
- Reduces hallucinations from inappropriate experts

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to automatically leverage LLMs' generative capacity to create an ensemble of experienced experts that can provide reliable situational reasoning for stance detection. The semi-parametric retrieval approach also adapts reasoning to the specific test context.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DEEM, a dynamic experienced expert modeling method for stance detection, which generates diverse experts from data, filters experienced ones, and retrieves relevant experts to make reasoning for stance predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing DEEM, a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling method for stance detection. Specifically:

1) DEEM generates diverse experts from the training data without much prior knowledge, then filters experienced experts that are generalizable and reliable for stance detection based on occurrence numbers and response accuracy. 

2) Instead of fully relying on generation during reasoning, DEEM introduces a retrieval mechanism to find the related experienced experts according to new sentences, making the involved experts more contextualized.

3) Experimental results on three standard stance detection benchmarks show that DEEM consistently outperforms methods like self-consistency reasoning and other expert-based reasoning approaches. It also helps reduce the bias of language models and mitigate potential hallucinations.

Overall, the key innovation is leveraging the wisdom of crowds by modeling dynamic experienced experts in a semi-parametric way, which enhances the reasoning capability of large language models for solving complex stance detection tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Stance detection - The main task that is the focus of the paper, which involves automatically identifying the stance expressed in a text towards a target. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper explores using large pretrained language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT for stance detection.

- Dynamic experienced expert modeling (DEEM) - The proposed method that generates possible experts from the training data, filters experienced ones, and retrieves relevant experts to help predict stance on new sentences.  

- Multi-agent reasoning - The paper draws inspiration from multi-agent and wisdom of crowds ideas to have multiple "experts" collaborate on making stance predictions.

- Few-shot learning - The paper evaluates performance in a few-shot setting without fine-tuning the large language models.

- Self-consistency - Compared method that requires generating multiple responses for the same input and aggregating predictions.

- Bias reduction - Analysis is done on potential of expert modeling to reduce stance bias exhibited by the language models.

In summary, the key focus is on stance detection, with a novel expert modeling approach that leverages the knowledge inside large language models. Both the task and method are important keywords for this paper.
