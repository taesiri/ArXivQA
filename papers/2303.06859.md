# [Learning Distortion Invariant Representation for Image Restoration from   A Causality Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06859)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks for image restoration to handle unknown distortions (i.e. distortion types and degrees not seen during training)?The key hypothesis is that by taking a causality perspective and learning distortion-invariant representations, the generalization ability on unseen distortions can be improved. Specifically, the paper proposes:1) Treating distortion types/degrees as confounders and using counterfactual distortion augmentation to simulate different confounders. 2) Instantiating interventions on distortions through virtually updating the model, and eliminating the interventions via meta-learning to achieve distortion-invariant representations.In summary, the paper introduces a causality-inspired training approach called Distortion-Invariant Representation Learning (DIL) to improve generalization on out-of-distribution distortions by removing the harmful bias caused by confounding effects of distortions seen during training. The central hypothesis is that this will enable the model to restore images independently of distortion type/degree.
