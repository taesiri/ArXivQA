# [DocMSU: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Document-level Multimodal Sarcasm   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal sarcasm understanding (MSU) benchmarks and approaches focus on sentence-level, but fail to handle document-level news where sarcasm clues may be small and sparse across long text. 
- News content is more diverse than sentence-level comments like tweets that focus on few topics. So sentence-level MSU methods may not apply.

Proposed Solution:
- Presents a new comprehensive benchmark called DocMSU for document-level multimodal sarcasm understanding in news:
    - Contains 102,588 news pieces with text-image pairs covering 9 topics 
    - High quality manual annotations over 3 rounds by 15 workers
    - Binary labels for sarcasm detection 
    - Textual spans and visual boxes for sarcasm localization

- Proposes a novel MSU method to align visual and textual features: 
    - Encodes images into pixel-level features and text into token-level features
    - Fuses them in a fine-grained manner using sliding windows 
    - Captures subtle sarcastic clues in both modalities
    - Improves cross-modal alignment for irony understanding  

Main Contributions:
- Curates a large-scale, comprehensive and high-quality benchmark DocMSU to facilitate research into document-level multimodal sarcasm understanding much closer to real-world news applications
- Overcomes new challenges posed by DocMSU in detecting sparse sarcasm clues across long text and aligning inconsistent visual-textual clues  
- Achieves strong performance on DocMSU for sarcasm detection and localization, demonstrating effectiveness of proposed method

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through the introduction of the DocMSU benchmark and a novel MSU technique tailored for document-level multimodal news content. Experiments verify the meaningfulness of the dataset and the capabilities of the approach.
