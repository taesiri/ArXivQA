# [DMS*: Minimizing Makespan for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06314)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new algorithm called Deferred M* (DMS*) to solve the min-max variant of the Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (MCPF-max) problem, which seeks to minimize the maximum arrival time (makespan) of all agents. DMS* adapts the existing M* algorithm but further develops two techniques to defer expensive computation of target sequencing until needed. First, DMS* uses a fast heuristic estimate instead of calling the traveling salesman problem solver when successors are generated. Second, DMS* attempts to reuse previously computed target sequences instead of recomputing from scratch to avoid frequent calls to the solver. DMS* is analyzed to be complete and optimal under certain assumptions. Empirical results on benchmarks with up to 20 agents and 80 targets demonstrate DMS* triples the success rates and reduces average runtime compared to a baseline adaptation of M*. Robot experiments also showcase DMS* is able to produce short makespan solutions while other methods lead to longer makespan. Overall, the two techniques to defer target sequencing effectively expedite the search process and improve the scalability.
