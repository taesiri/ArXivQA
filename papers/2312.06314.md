# [DMS*: Minimizing Makespan for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06314)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new algorithm called Deferred M* (DMS*) to solve the min-max variant of the Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (MCPF-max) problem, which seeks to minimize the maximum arrival time (makespan) of all agents. DMS* adapts the existing M* algorithm but further develops two techniques to defer expensive computation of target sequencing until needed. First, DMS* uses a fast heuristic estimate instead of calling the traveling salesman problem solver when successors are generated. Second, DMS* attempts to reuse previously computed target sequences instead of recomputing from scratch to avoid frequent calls to the solver. DMS* is analyzed to be complete and optimal under certain assumptions. Empirical results on benchmarks with up to 20 agents and 80 targets demonstrate DMS* triples the success rates and reduces average runtime compared to a baseline adaptation of M*. Robot experiments also showcase DMS* is able to produce short makespan solutions while other methods lead to longer makespan. Overall, the two techniques to defer target sequencing effectively expedite the search process and improve the scalability.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding with Min-Max Objective (MCPF-max) problem. This problem seeks to find a set of collision-free paths for multiple agents from their initial locations to assigned goal locations, while visiting intermediate target locations along the way. The objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the maximum arrival time of all agents. This is challenging as it requires solving both the multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem to avoid collisions between agents, as well as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) to assign and sequence targets for each agent.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new algorithm called Deferred MS* (DMS*) to address MCPF-max. DMS* is based on the existing MS* algorithm for MCPF with sum-of-costs minimization. DMS* introduces two new techniques:

1) Deferred target sequencing: Avoid solving TSP to find target sequences unless absolutely needed. Use fast heuristic estimates first and only solve TSP when a state is selected for expansion. 

2) Reuse prior target sequences: For agents not in conflict, reuse their existing target sequences instead of re-solving TSP, until their cost margin is depleted.

These techniques reduce the computational burden of repeatedly solving TSP during search.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the MCPF-max problem which minimizes makespan 
- The DMS* algorithm to address MCPF-max using deferred target sequencing
- Analysis of completeness, optimality and bounded-suboptimality properties
- Experimental evaluation in simulations and on differential drive robots
- Demonstrated improved success rates and reduced runtime compared to a baseline

The summary covers the key problem addressed, the proposed DMS* algorithm and techniques, the theoretical analysis, experimental validation, and highlights the two main contributions of deferred target sequencing to reduce computational burden.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a min-max variant of the Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (MCPF) problem, called MCPF-max, which seeks to minimize the makespan (maximum arrival time) of the agents.

2. It adapts the existing MS* algorithm to solve MCPF-max.

3. It develops two new techniques to defer expensive target sequencing computations in MS* to improve the runtime efficiency: (a) using a rough heuristic estimate to avoid calling the TSP solver when successors are generated, and (b) attempting to reuse previously computed target sequences before calling the TSP solver.

4. It analyzes the properties of the resulting new algorithm called Deferred MS* (DMS*), proving its completeness and optimality.

5. It evaluates DMS* in simulations with up to 20 agents and 80 targets, showing improved success rates and runtime over the baseline, as well as in experiments on differential drive robots demonstrating the usefulness of optimizing makespan.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What is the key motivation for formulating the min-max variant of Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (\abbrMCPFMax) instead of the commonly used min-sum variant (\abbrMCPFSum)? Explain the practical benefits of optimizing for makespan instead of sum of arrival times.

2) Explain the two techniques proposed in Deferred \abbrMS (\abbrDMS) to defer expensive target sequencing computations. Why is frequent target sequencing a computational bottleneck in previous methods? 

3) The paper mentions maintaining a back_set(l) for each label l during search. Explain the purpose of this data structure and how it relates to conflict propagation in \abbrDMS.  

4) Under what assumptions can optimality of the solution joint path be guaranteed in \abbrDMS? Explain why these assumptions are needed for optimality proofs.

5) Describe how systematic dominance checking between labels ensures completeness of the algorithm. What is the intuition behind avoiding expansion of dominated labels?  

6) Explain the notion of a label being "on-policy" versus "off-policy" in \abbrDMS and how this distinction relates to deferred target sequencing.

7) What modifications to \abbrDMS would be needed if the requirement for optimal solutions was relaxed to allow bounded-suboptimality?  

8) How does the coupling between agents in the space of binary target vectors affect optimality guarantees when target sequences are changed? Suggest ways to address this.

9) What considerations would be important if \abbrDMS was implemented on robots subject to motion uncertainty? Suggest possible extensions to handle uncertain executions.

10) How can ideas from \abbrDMS be integrated with existing Multi-Agent Path Finding methods to improve performance in practice? What components would be reusable?
