# [Just-in-Time Security Patch Detection -- LLM At the Rescue for Data   Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open source software is widespread, but vulnerabilities are increasingly being discovered, enabling "N-day" attacks on unpatched systems. This highlights the need for promptly identifying and prioritizing critical security patches.  
- However, the large volume of patches makes this challenging, and inconsistencies in how patches are released often means security patches lack visibility, leaving users exposed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new security patch detection system called LLMDA which leverages large language models (LLMs) for patch analysis and data augmentation.
- It generates explanations for patches using LLMs and creates instructions to guide the model, differentiating security and non-security patches.
- A Patch-Text Former (PT-Former) aligns and fuses the patch code embeddings and text embeddings from the explanation/description.
- A probabilistic batch contrastive learning mechanism brings similar patches closer and dissimilar ones further apart to improve discrimination of security patches.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework for security patch detection that combines strengths of LLMs and cross-modal learning through code-text alignment and batch contrastive learning.
- Significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods like GraphSPD and TwinRNN on the PatchDB and SPI-DB datasets, with over 20% higher F1-score.
- Highlights potential of language-centric approaches over just source code characteristics for security patch detection. 
- Demonstrates practical applicability through high precision and low false positive rates.

In summary, the paper makes notable advances in security patch detection to address the growing vulnerabilities in open source software, by effectively utilizing recent innovations in LLMs and self-supervised representation learning. The results showcase its real-world viability.
