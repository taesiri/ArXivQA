# Shift-Net: Image Inpainting via Deep Feature Rearrangement

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network architecture called Shift-Net for image inpainting. The main research question it addresses is: how can we develop an image inpainting method that produces results with both semantically plausible global structure as well as fine detailed textures? The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes a Shift-Net architecture based on U-Net that adds a special shift-connection layer to efficiently combine exemplar-based and CNN-based inpainting.- Introduces a guidance loss on the decoder features to make them similar to the ground truth encoder features for the missing regions. This guides the shift operation to transfer details properly.- The shift operation transfers features from the known region to the missing regions to fill in the details.- Combines guidance loss, reconstruction loss, and adversarial loss to train the network end-to-end.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating semantically plausible and visually realistic inpainting results with fine details.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by combining exemplar-based and CNN-based inpainting through a guided shift operation within a U-Net architecture, they can achieve better inpainting results than previous methods relying solely on either approach. The experiments demonstrate this hypothesis.
