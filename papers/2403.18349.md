# [Rejection Improves Reliability: Training LLMs to Refuse Unknown   Questions Using RL from Knowledge Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) often generate erroneous, "hallucinated" outputs when asked questions beyond their actual knowledge. This happens because they try to answer questions without knowing their own knowledge limitations.
- Evaluating model "honesty" is challenging due to the lack of true knowledge labels and differing knowledge capacities of models. Traditional classification metrics are unsuitable.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new concept of model "reliability" from the user's perspective - maximizing correct answers while minimizing errors. 
- Propose new metrics like accuracy, accountability and overall reliability score to evaluate both model helpfulness and honesty.
- Present a "Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF)" framework that leverages knowledge feedback to teach models when to refuse answering unknown questions. This helps align models better with their knowledge limitations.

Main Contributions:
- Formalize the notion of reliability for language models and define quantitative metrics to measure it. 
- Propose a novel RLKF framework to improve language model reliability using reinforcement learning and tailored reward models.
- Demonstrate through experiments that RLKF significantly enhances model reliability for both in-domain and out-of-domain test cases.

The key insight is to align models with their knowledge limitations, rather than just maximize correctness. The RLKF framework equips models to know what they don't know.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework called Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF) to improve the reliability of large language models by training them to explicitly refuse questions that are beyond their knowledge boundary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the concept of model reliability and defining metrics to assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). These include accuracy, accountability, and an overall reliability score.

2. Proposing the Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF) training framework to improve LLM reliability. RLKF leverages knowledge feedback to determine the model's knowledge boundary and trains a reliable reward model to encourage refusing out-of-knowledge questions. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments that validate the efficacy of the RLKF framework in significantly enhancing LLM reliability on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework (RLKF) to enhance the reliability of LLMs by aligning them with their knowledge boundaries, and showing through experiments that this framework is effective. The reliability metrics are also an important contribution towards better evaluating model honesty.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Model reliability - The paper introduces this concept to assess both the helpfulness and honesty of language models. Reliability metrics like accuracy, accountability, and reliability score are proposed.

- Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF) - This is the proposed training framework to improve model reliability using knowledge feedback to teach the model when to refuse to answer. 

- Hallucination - Erroneous or incorrect outputs generated by language models are referred to as hallucinations. A key focus of the paper is mitigating these hallucinations.

- Alignment - Aligning language models to behave according to user intentions and preferences. The paper examines honesty alignment specifically.

- Refusal/Rejection - The model learning to refuse or reject answering questions that are beyond its knowledge scope is a core idea explored in the paper.

- In-domain vs. out-of-domain - Experiments are conducted on both in-domain (arithmetic) and out-of-domain (GSM8K) datasets to assess model reliability.

- Helpfulness - Maximizing helpful outputs while minimizing incorrect outputs is how the paper defines reliability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed RLKF framework build upon existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods? What modifications were made to adapt RLHF for improving model reliability?

2. The concept of "model reliability" is introduced in this paper. Can you explain in more detail how reliability differs from traditional metrics like accuracy? Why are new metrics needed to properly evaluate model honesty?  

3. In the reliable preference data synthesis process, what principles guide the selection of different comparison pairs based on model response types and the assessment of the model's knowledge boundary?

4. When constructing the reliable preference dataset for the out-of-domain setting, self-consistency of model responses is used as a criteria. What are the limitations of using self-consistency instead of ground truth labels?

5. The paper states that training the reward model on only out-of-domain reliable preference data does not enhance reliability on that data. Why does combining in-domain and out-of-domain data lead to better performance?  

6. How many training iterations are used during policy optimization in the experiments? Is there a risk of overfitting with more training iterations? How can we determine the optimal number?

7. What adjustments could be made to the RLKF framework if applying it to a different domain like open-domain QA instead of mathematical reasoning? Would new methods be needed to assess the model's knowledge boundary?

8. The accountability metric balances model coverage and error rate. In some applications, minimizing errors may be much more important. How could the method be adapted if preventing any errors is critical?

9. When evaluating model reliability using the proposed metrics, what are some key limitations or caveats to consider before making claims about model performance?

10. The authors propose that alignment with the model's knowledge boundary is key to mitigating hallucinations. What other techniques could complement this approach to further reduce harmful model outputs?
