# [Relationship between auditory and semantic entrainment using Deep Neural   Networks (DNN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Entrainment refers to the tendency for speakers to align their behavior during conversations. It occurs across linguistic levels (acoustic, lexical, syntactic, semantic). 
- Prior work has studied entrainment on individual levels, but there is limited understanding of the relationships between entrainment across levels. 
- Understanding these relationships is important for developing spoken dialog systems that can entrain effectively to improve human-machine interactions.

Methods:
- The authors analyze acoustic/auditory and semantic entrainment in two comparable corpora of collaborative task-oriented dialogs - one in English (Columbia Games) and one in Slovak (SK Games).  
- They extract auditory features using TRILL embeddings and semantic features using SBERT/SlovakBERT to represent each dialog turn.
- They measure 3 types of entrainment: proximity (similarity at turn exchanges), convergence (increasing similarity over time), synchrony (correlated self-similarity over time).
- They also measure the correlation between auditory and semantic entrainment.

Key Results:
- Proximity is more common than convergence/synchrony in both semantic and auditory entrainment. 
- Semantic proximity is more prevalent than auditory proximity in the task-oriented dialogs.
- Auditory and semantic entrainment are positively correlated, suggesting entrainment may link across linguistic levels.
- The strength of the correlation differs across semantic representation models and languages.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a methodology to compare entrainment across linguistic levels using state-of-the-art DNN embeddings.
- Finds semantic entrainment is more prevalent and that entrainment is positively correlated across semantic and auditory levels in two languages. 
- Shows language models impact estimates ofcorrelation strength between levels.
- Results can inform development of entrainment capabilities in spoken dialog systems to improve human-computer interaction.
