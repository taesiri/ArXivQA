# [Efficient Post-Training Augmentation for Adaptive Inference in   Heterogeneous and Distributed IoT Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Early exit neural networks (EENNs) can improve efficiency of neural network inferencing by having multiple classifier branches that allow early exit. However, designing optimal EENN architectures requires extensive expertise. 
- Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods for finding good EENN architectures rely on expensive evolutionary algorithms and take very long time even with lots of compute resources. This makes EENNs inaccessible to many developers without access to large compute clusters.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an automated framework that can take a pretrained neural network model and convert it into an EENN optimized for a heterogeneous/distributed target platform.
- The key ideas are:
   1) Construct EENN architecture by mutating the base model, estimate costs to prune invalid options
   2) Train/evaluate early exit branches independently by freezing backbone weights  
   3) Convert threshold search to graph problem, find optimal confidence thresholds
   4) Jointly finetune full EENN and re-optimize thresholds
- Framework designed explicitly for IoT applications and aims to find good EENNs very fast even on a laptop CPU.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first automated flow to convert a standard NN into a optimized EENN mapped onto heterogeneous hardware, including configuring the decision thresholds. 
- Demonstrates converting speech command and ECG classification networks for Arm Cortex MCUs, reducing MACs and energy.
- Analyzes CIFAR image classification networks, finds optimized EENN for phone+cloud scenario in under 9 hours on a laptop.
- Achieves 2-5x faster search than NAS methods, while finding EENNs that provide efficiency gains, making EENNs more accessible.

In summary, the paper provides an automated and efficient way to convert trained neural networks into optimized early-exiting networks for heterogeneous devices to improve efficiency, with notably fast search times compared to NAS techniques. This helps make the benefits of EENNs more accessible to developers without large compute resources.
