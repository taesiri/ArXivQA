# [Concentric Spherical GNN for 3D Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10484v1)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new multi-sphere convolutional architecture called Concentric Spherical GNN (CSGNN) for learning representations of 3D data that are invariant/equivariant to rotations. 

- Introducing a concentric spherical discretization made up of multiple spheres at different radii, as opposed to just a single sphere used in prior spherical CNN works. This is argued to better capture 3D data distributions.

- Defining two types of convolutions over the multi-sphere discretization: graph convolutions to incorporate intra-sphere information and new radial convolutions to incorporate inter-sphere information. 

- Demonstrating the approach on two 3D classification tasks with different input data types - mesh objects and point clouds. For point clouds, a mapping method is proposed to project the irregular data to the spherical discretization.

- Achieving improved performance over prior spherical CNN methods on the SHREC17 mesh classification task and state-of-the-art performance on the ModelNet40 point cloud classification task, especially in the challenging setting of arbitrary rotations.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new multi-sphere convolutional architecture that can learn more expressive 3D representations compared to prior spherical CNNs restricted to a single sphere, while retaining rotational equivariance. The effectiveness is shown through experiments on 3D shape classification.
