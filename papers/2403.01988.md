# [FakeNewsGPT4: Advancing Multimodal Fake News Detection through   Knowledge-Augmented LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01988)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fake news detection is an important problem, but existing methods are typically trained and evaluated within closed domains, limiting their capability to handle open-world distribution shifts.
- Two key challenges with open-world fake news: (1) Diverse manipulated content using creative manipulation strategies. (2) Diverse realistic context due to differences in regional perspectives, language styles, etc.  
- Classical fake news detectors struggle with this domain shift issue and fail to generalize across domains.

Proposed Solution (FakeNewsGPT4):
- Leverage world knowledge from Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to provide complementary information and mitigate distribution discrepancies. 
- Augment LVLMs with two types of forgery-specific knowledge beneficial for manipulation reasoning: (1) Semantic correlation between modalities. (2) Artifact traces from manipulations.
- Extract semantic correlations using a multi-level cross-modal reasoning module with dual-branch cross-attention.
- Extract artifact traces using a dual-branch fine-grained verification module.
- Transform the generated knowledge into refined embeddings compatible with LVLMs.
- Introduce MFND instruction-following data, candidate answer heuristics and soft prompts to enhance input informativeness.  

Main Contributions:
- Pioneer using world knowledge from LVLMs to tackle domain shift in multimodal fake news detection.
- Propose FakeNewsGPT4 framework to augment LVLMs with forgery-specific knowledge via cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained verification.
- Show superior cross-domain performance over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, FakeNewsGPT4 incorporates both world knowledge from LVLMs and external forgery-specific knowledge to better detect fake news across domains with distribution shifts. The proposed techniques outperform prior arts on this challenging problem.
