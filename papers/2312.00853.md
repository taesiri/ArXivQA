# [Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion for Temporally Consistent Real-world   Video Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) videos to high-resolution (HR). Most VSR methods assume simple degradations between LR and HR, failing on real-world videos with complex degradations. 
- Recently, diffusion models have shown compelling image generation ability. But directly applying them to VSR suffers from temporal inconsistency due to the intrinsic randomness of diffusion process.

Method:
- Propose a Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion (MGLD) model for real-world VSR. It incorporates motion dynamics of input video into the diffusion process to enhance temporal consistency.

Key Components:
- Motion-Guided Diffusion Sampling: 
   - Compute optical flows between frames and warp latent features across frames.
   - Define motion-guided loss based on warping error to guide the sampling process.
   - Reduce artifacts by ignoring occlusion regions.
- Temporal-Aware Sequence Decoder:  
   - Insert temporal convolutions into decoder and fine-tune with ground-truth videos.
   - Employ sequence losses like frame difference loss to ensure smoothness.
   - Use controllable feature transform to inject encoder information.

Main Contributions:
- Propose to incorporate motion information from input video to guide the latent diffusion sampling, enhancing temporal consistency.
- Design an innovative temporal-aware decoder and tailor the training losses to further improve continuity and realism. 
- Achieve state-of-the-art real-world VSR performance. Outperform previous methods in generating realistic and temporally coherent details.
