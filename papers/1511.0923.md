# [Differential Dynamic Microscopy to characterize Brownian motion and   bacteria motility](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.0923)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How to develop a type theory and associated logic that can serve as a foundation for probabilistic and Bayesian reasoning?

The key components of the proposed approach include:

- A quantitative logic with fuzzy predicates that take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. This allows predicates to represent probabilities.

- The logic forms an "effect module" which has some similarities with Boolean algebras but also key differences like a partial sum operation.

- The type theory includes operations for normalization and conditioning of probability distributions, which is crucial for Bayesian inference. 

- There is a close connection between predicates and "instrument" maps, which allows conditioning to be defined via assert maps and normalization. This is a key property that distinguishes the probabilistic setting from the quantum setting.

- The computation rules of the type theory are designed to allow calculations like conditioning and marginalization to be carried out, as demonstrated on some examples.

So in summary, the main research goal is to develop a type theory tailored for probabilistic reasoning that supports operations and a logic needed for applications like Bayesian inference, while keeping connections to the underlying mathematical models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning, called COMET (COMmutative Effectus Theory). The key features of COMET include:

- It has a quantitative logic, with fuzzy predicates that take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. 

- It includes normalisation and conditioning operations, allowing probabilities to be normalised and conditional probabilities to be calculated.

- It has a key distinction from quantum type theory in that there is a bijective correspondence between predicates and side-effect free "instrument" operations. This allows suitable computation rules for conditional probability to be derived.

2. It shows how probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian inference computations can be formalized directly in the type theory syntax, and computations carried out using the deduction rules. This is illustrated via two examples.

3. It provides a semantics for the type theory using both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Thus the type theory can serve as a internal language for reasoning about both discrete and continuous probabilistic computation.

4. It sketches how the type theory can be interpreted in categorical models called "commutative effectuses", providing a solid mathematical foundation.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled type-theoretic foundation for probabilistic computation and reasoning, which can support mechanized probabilistic inference. The examples show how it enables Bayesian computations to be carried out formally within the deductive system.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference that includes quantitative fuzzy predicates, normalization and conditioning of states via assertion maps, and allows conditional probabilities to be calculated through derived computation rules.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper introduces a new type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning. Other works have developed type theories for probability before, such as the quantitative type theory of McBride. However, this appears to be a novel type theory specifically aimed at probabilistic and Bayesian reasoning.

- The logic in this type theory is quantitative, with fuzzy predicates taking values in [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. This is different from most type theories which have Boolean truth values. The quantitative logic connects nicely to the probabilistic aspects.

- The type theory incorporates normalisation and conditioning of states, which enables Bayesian inference computations to be formalized and done within the theory. This is a key distinguishing aspect compared to other probabilistic type theories.

- The conditioning operation using assert maps seems original and leverages the bijective correspondence between predicates and side-effect free actions that holds in a probabilistic (but not quantum) setting. 

- Overall, the combination of quantitative logic, normalisation, conditioning via assert, and the aim of mechanizing Bayesian inference within a type theory makes this work stand out compared to prior type-theoretic approaches to probability.

- The two examples show how Bayesian reasoning can be formalized in the type theory. This application to practical probabilistic inference differentiates the work from more theoretical developments of probabilistic type theories.

- The type theory connects conceptually to recent work on effectus theory and categorical probability/quantum foundations, but is formulated as a full-fledged programming language.

In summary, the novel type theory, quantitative logic, support for Bayesian reasoning, and examples provide original contributions over previous type-theoretic approaches to probability. The results look promising for mechanized probabilistic programming and inference.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing tool support for the COMET language, so that the calculations done by hand in the paper can be automated. This could provide a formal language for Bayesian inference.

- Elaborating continuous probability examples in COMET, in addition to the discrete examples given. The type theory can be interpreted both discretely and continuously. 

- Exploring applications to Bayesian quantum theory, by using the normalisation and conditioning operations in a quantum (non-commutative) setting.

- Investigating variations and extensions of COMET, such as adding recursion/loops, non-determinism, different inference rules, etc.

- Connecting COMET to existing probabilistic programming languages and inference systems, to compare expressiveness and capabilities.

- Implementing important statistical techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling within COMET.

- Developing graphical interfaces for specifying probabilistic models and queries in COMET.

- Investigating complexity and performance aspects of probabilistic inference in COMET.

- Applying COMET to real-world probabilistic modeling and inference tasks to further validate the approach.

Overall, the authors suggest developing COMET into a full-featured probabilistic programming language, integrating it with existing systems, expanding the set of statistical techniques supported, and applying it to practical problems, as interesting directions for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference. The logic is quantitative with fuzzy predicates valued in probabilities instead of Booleans. The type theory includes normalisation and conditioning of probability distributions via assert maps, which are in bijective correspondence with predicates in the probabilistic setting. This allows deriving computation rules to calculate conditional probabilities, as demonstrated in two examples of Bayesian reasoning. The probabilistic type theory, called COMET, can be seen as an internal language for commutative effectus models and may form a basis for mechanising Bayesian inference.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference. The type theory includes quantitative, fuzzy predicates that take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. It allows for normalisation of states and conditioning via assert maps, which provide a bijective correspondence between predicates and side-effect free actions. This correspondence is a key aspect that distinguishes the probabilistic type theory from quantum type theory. The paper shows how suitable computation rules for conditioning and calculating conditional probabilities can be derived from the predicate-action relationship. It demonstrates the use of these rules in two examples of Bayesian reasoning in graphical models. Thus, the type theory provides a formal foundation for mechanizing Bayesian inference.

The paper first provides an overview of the syntax and rules of the type theory, which is based on the mathematical framework of effectus theory. It then walks through two examples of Bayesian reasoning formalized in the type theory, involving conditioning and marginalization. Next, it delves more deeply into the metatheory, proving results about the predicate-action correspondence and deriving the computation rules used in the examples. The paper sketches how the type theory can be interpreted in discrete probabilistic, continuous probabilistic, and simple set-theoretic models. It concludes by describing avenues for future work, including support for continuous probability, connections to quantum theory, and tool support for automating Bayesian inference in the framework.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic and Bayesian reasoning. The logic is quantitative, with fuzzy predicates that take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. The type theory includes normalisation of states and conditioning via assert maps, which are shown to correspond bijectively to predicates in the probabilistic setting. This allows the derivation of computation rules that underly calculations of conditional probabilities in Bayesian inference examples. The overall approach thus provides a formal basis for mechanizing Bayesian reasoning by giving both a language for probabilistic programs and a logic for quantitative reasoning about probabilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a new type theory and logic for probabilistic and Bayesian reasoning. It aims to provide a formal foundation for specifying probabilistic programs and carrying out Bayesian inference within a unified framework.

Some key aspects the paper addresses:

- It develops a quantitative logic where predicates take values in the interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. This allows "fuzzy" predicates that represent probabilities.

- The logic forms an "effect module" over probabilities rather than a Boolean algebra. This captures the algebraic structure needed for probabilistic/Bayesian reasoning.

- The type theory supports normalisation of probability distributions, which is crucial for Bayesian inference. It also supports conditioning states via "assert maps", which provide a key link between predicates and side-effect free actions.

- This predicate-action connection, along with the rules for conditioning, allow the derivation of computation rules for calculating conditional probabilities. The paper shows this on two standard Bayesian reasoning examples.

- The type theory is interpreted semantically in probabilistic models, both discrete and continuous. This gives a formal foundation for the reasoning.

In summary, it provides a probabilistic type theory tailored for Bayesian inference that combines program specification, quantitative logic, normalisation, and computation rules for conditioning and calculating probabilities. The aim is to ultimately support mechanized Bayesian reasoning.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic and Bayesian reasoning. The logic is quantitative in nature, with fuzzy predicates taking values in the unit interval [0,1] instead of just {0,1}. As a result, the predicates do not form Boolean algebras but effect modules. The type theory includes normalisation and conditioning of states, where conditioning uses a key aspect that distinguishes this theory from quantum type theory - the bijective correspondence between predicates and side-effect free actions called instrument (or assert) maps. The paper shows how suitable computation rules for conditioning can be derived from this predicate-action correspondence. These rules are then used to do exact conditional inference in two well-known examples of Bayesian reasoning in graphical models. Thus, the introduced type theory may form the basis for mechanizing Bayesian inference. Key features include probabilistic choice, normalisation of distributions, conditioning via assert maps and normalisation, a quantitative logic where predicates form effect modules, and the derivation of computation rules that allow conditional probabilities to be calculated inside the type theory.
