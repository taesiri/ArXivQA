# [MalPurifier: Enhancing Android Malware Detection with Adversarial   Purification against Evasion Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06423)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MalPurifier, a novel defense method against evasion attacks in Android malware detection based on adversarial purification. MalPurifier employs a Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) to purify perturbed malware samples by projecting them back to their original form while preserving benign examples, enabling correct classification by the detector. To enhance defense effectiveness, diversified adversarial Android malware is generated by progressively increasing perturbations to improve robustness. Additionally, "protective noise" is injected into benign samples to prevent over-purification. Furthermore, MalPurifier customizes the DAE's loss function by combining reconstruction loss and prediction loss from the malware detector's internal representations, enhancing feature learning for accurate reconstruction and classification. Extensive experiments on Drebin and Androzoo datasets demonstrate MalPurifier's superior performance over state-of-the-art defenses against 37 attacks, achieving over 90.91% accuracy. Notably, MalPurifier demonstrates easy scalability by enhancing other detectors' robustness against 6 adaptive attacks as a plug-in module, without retraining. Key advantages include flexibility, low overhead, and strong defense capability against varying perturbations.
