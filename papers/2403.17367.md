# [RoboDuet: A Framework Affording Mobile-Manipulation and Cross-Embodiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Integrating mobility of legged robots with manipulation skills of arms can expand operational range and capabilities for mobile manipulation tasks. 
- Existing approaches have limitations in precise 6DOF manipulation and limited workspace for the arm.
- Challenging to achieve whole-body control with stable gaits and accurate end-effector tracking over a large workspace.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose RoboDuet framework with two collaborative policies - loco policy for locomotion and arm policy for manipulation.
- Two policies interact - arm policy guides loco policy adjustments while loco policy expands arm's workspace.
- Two-stage training process - Stage 1 trains loco policy, Stage 2 simultaneously trains loco and arm policies.
- Enables cross-embodiment deployment, allowing different quadrupeds to reuse trained arm policy.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves robust locomotion and precise 6DOF end-effector tracking for mobile manipulation.
- Coordination between policies enables large workspace and agile tracking.  
- Two-stage training enhances stability and performance.
- Cross-embodiment allows legged robot replacement without full policy retraining.
- Demonstrates tracking accuracy, gait stability and cross-embodiment capabilities in simulations and real-world experiments.

In summary, the paper proposes an integrated framework RoboDuet that utilizes a two-policy coordination approach and two-stage training to achieve whole-body control for mobile manipulation. It demonstrates enhanced performance and enables cross-embodiment deployment across quadrupeds.
