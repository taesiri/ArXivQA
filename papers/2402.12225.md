# [Pushing Auto-regressive Models for 3D Shape Generation at Capacity and   Scalability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing 3D shape generation methods like GANs struggle with issues of poor capacity to generate high-quality and diverse shapes. They also have limited scalability. Recent auto-regressive (AR) models have shown promise for 2D image generation, but directly applying them to 3D tasks encounters two key challenges: (1) the high computational demands of modeling joint distributions over volumetric grids, and (2) the ambiguity in determining the auto-regressive order when flattening 3D grids into 1D sequences. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an improved AR framework called Argus3D to address the above limitations. The key ideas are:

(1) Project encoded voxel grids onto three axis-aligned orthogonal planes to reduce complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2) while preserving essential 3D information.

(2) Introduce a coupling network to further project plane features into a compact latent space. This creates a more tractable order for auto-regression without strict spatial mapping.

(3) Apply vector quantization on the latent space for discrete representation learning. This allows using a simple transformer decoder to model joint distributions.

(4) Concatenate various conditional inputs like point clouds, categories, images to enable both unconditional and conditional generation.

(5) Scale up model size to 3.6 billion parameters and use a newly introduced 900K shape dataset to improve capacity.

Main Contributions:

(1) An improved AR framework Argus3D that can generate high-quality and diverse 3D shapes for various conditional and unconditional tasks.

(2) A compact latent space representation to tackle limitations of auto-regressing 3D grids, improving capacity. 

(3) Scaled up models with 3.6B parameters and a 900K shape dataset, setting new benchmarks. Argus3D achieves SOTA on tasks like class-conditional and image-conditional generation.

(4) Extensive experiments demonstrating Argus3D's superior performance and generalization ability to real images and zero-shot generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an improved autoregressive model called Argus3D that leverages discrete representation learning and model scaling to push the state-of-the-art in versatile 3D shape generation under multi-modal conditional inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel auto-regressive framework, termed Argus3D, for 3D shape generation. Argus3D can switch between unconditional and conditional generation for various conditioning inputs like point clouds, categories, images, and texts.

2. Introducing an improved discrete representation learning method which builds joint distributions for a latent vector instead of volumetric grids or triple planes. This develops auto-regressive models for 3D shape generation in terms of capacity, by addressing limitations like high computational demands on 3D grids and ambiguous order for auto-regression. 

3. Promoting the generation ability of Argus3D in terms of scalability, by expanding the model parameters and dataset size. Argus3D-Huge is claimed to be the largest 3D generation model currently, with 3.6 billion parameters trained on approximately 900,000 3D shapes. The collected dataset is named Objaverse-Mix.

4. Conducting extensive experiments on four tasks to demonstrate Argus3D can generate more faithful and diverse shapes, achieving state-of-the-art performance for unconditional and conditional 3D shape generation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an improved auto-regressive model Argus3D that pushes the boundaries of 3D shape generation in terms of both capacity and scalability.

- Conditional generation - The model supports both unconditional and conditional generation based on various inputs like point clouds, categories, images, and text descriptions.

- Scalability - The paper investigates scaling up both the model size (up to 3.6 billion parameters) and the training data (900K shapes) to enhance generation quality.

- Objaverse-Mix dataset - A large-scale 3D shape dataset assembled and cleaned from multiple public sources to facilitate training large models.

- Fidelity and diversity - Key evaluation metrics to measure how accurate/realistic and varied the generated 3D shapes are.

So in summary, the key themes are leveraging auto-regressive transformers, discrete representations, conditional generation, and large-scale modeling for high-quality 3D shape synthesis.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes projecting volumetric grids onto three axis-aligned planes before vector quantization to reduce computational complexity. How does this projection affect the ability to represent detailed shape geometries compared to volumetric grids?

7. This method outperforms previous auto-regressive 3D generation methods. What are the key reasons that lead to these performance gains?

8. How does the order of axis-aligned plane projections affect the final reconstruction quality? Did the authors experiment with different projection orders?

9. What are the limitations of scaling up model size and data size? Is there a point where additional scale does not lead to performance gains?

10. The method is evaluated on multiple datasets and tasks. Are there any datasets or tasks where performance is significantly weaker? If so, what gaps need to be addressed?
