# [Pushing Auto-regressive Models for 3D Shape Generation at Capacity and   Scalability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing 3D shape generation methods like GANs struggle with issues of poor capacity to generate high-quality and diverse shapes. They also have limited scalability. Recent auto-regressive (AR) models have shown promise for 2D image generation, but directly applying them to 3D tasks encounters two key challenges: (1) the high computational demands of modeling joint distributions over volumetric grids, and (2) the ambiguity in determining the auto-regressive order when flattening 3D grids into 1D sequences. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an improved AR framework called Argus3D to address the above limitations. The key ideas are:

(1) Project encoded voxel grids onto three axis-aligned orthogonal planes to reduce complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2) while preserving essential 3D information.

(2) Introduce a coupling network to further project plane features into a compact latent space. This creates a more tractable order for auto-regression without strict spatial mapping.

(3) Apply vector quantization on the latent space for discrete representation learning. This allows using a simple transformer decoder to model joint distributions.

(4) Concatenate various conditional inputs like point clouds, categories, images to enable both unconditional and conditional generation.

(5) Scale up model size to 3.6 billion parameters and use a newly introduced 900K shape dataset to improve capacity.

Main Contributions:

(1) An improved AR framework Argus3D that can generate high-quality and diverse 3D shapes for various conditional and unconditional tasks.

(2) A compact latent space representation to tackle limitations of auto-regressing 3D grids, improving capacity. 

(3) Scaled up models with 3.6B parameters and a 900K shape dataset, setting new benchmarks. Argus3D achieves SOTA on tasks like class-conditional and image-conditional generation.

(4) Extensive experiments demonstrating Argus3D's superior performance and generalization ability to real images and zero-shot generation.
