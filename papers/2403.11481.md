# [VideoAgent: A Memory-augmented Multimodal Agent for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Understanding lengthy videos and answering free-form queries remains challenging for current video-language models due to prohibitive computation costs and difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies. This has hindered applying sophisticated foundation models to video understanding tasks.

Proposed Solution - VideoAgent:
The paper proposes VideoAgent, a multimodal agent powered by a large language model (LLM) and equipped with a structured memory mechanism for video understanding. The key components are:

1) A unified video memory with a temporal memory storing text descriptions of short video segments, and an object memory tracking objects across frames.

2) A set of tools invoked by the LLM in a step-by-step manner to gather information from the memories and raw video, including segment localization, caption retrieval, visual question answering and object state querying. 

3) The LLM reasons about the tools needed, provides inputs, processes outputs and aggregates information interactively until producing a final response.

Main Contributions:

1) A unified video memory design capturing both temporal event context and object states to facilitate reasoning.

2) VideoAgent, an efficient LLM-based multimodal agent that reconciles multiple foundation models through tool use rather than end-to-end training.

3) Strong performance on multiple video QA datasets, outperforming video-language models and multimodal agents. E.g. averaged 26.0% higher accuracy on EgoSchema.

The minimalist tool set, structured memory design and interactive tool use procedure contributes to VideoAgent's effectiveness on complex free-form video understanding tasks involving lengthy videos.
