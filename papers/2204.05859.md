# [Bootstrap Motion Forecasting With Self-Consistent Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05859)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we enforce consistency and robustness in deep learning models for motion forecasting? The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing "Dual Consistency Constraints" to enforce consistency in both spatial and temporal domains during training. This helps improve stability and noise tolerance.- Using a self-ensembling scheme to generate "Teacher Target Constraints" and provide more accurate multi-modal supervision. This helps with multi-modality and training convergence.- Combining the above ideas yields a model called MISC (Motion ForecastIng with Self-Consistent Constraints) that achieves state-of-the-art results on Argoverse and Waymo motion forecasting benchmarks.- Showing the proposed techniques are general and can be incorporated into other motion forecasting architectures for improved performance.So in summary, the main research thrust is enforcing different types of consistency in deep motion forecasting models, using techniques like consistency regularization and self-ensembling, to improve stability, robustness and multi-modality. The hypothesis seems to be that explicit consistency is beneficial for this task.
