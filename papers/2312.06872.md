# [ELSA: Partial Weight Freezing for Overhead-Free Sparse Network   Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying deep neural networks on devices with limited compute/memory is challenging as it requires choosing an appropriate network size. The standard approach of training multiple networks of different sparsities has drawbacks: it requires larger app size or network downloads.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes ELSA (Efficient Layer Sparsification Approach) which can embed one or more sparse networks within a single dense network. At prediction time, sparse networks of different sparsity levels can be extracted effortlessly from the dense network.

Key Ideas:
- Train an initial dense neural network. Sparsify this network using any sparsification technique while freezing weights of the sparse subnetwork. Then re-densify the network by training only non-frozen weights. This embeds a sparse network within the dense network.
- This process can be iterated multiple times to embed sparse networks of different sparsity levels within the same dense network. 
- At prediction time, sparse networks can be extracted by simply zeroing out non-frozen weights according to predefined masks. No fine-tuning needed.

Main Benefits:
- Allows easy deployment of multiple sparse networks nested within a single dense network. Reduces app size and eliminates need for network downloads.
- places no restrictions on network architecture, loss functions or optimization techniques used. Fully flexible and modular.
- Experiments show embedded sparse networks have negligible loss in accuracy compared to separately trained sparse networks.

Key Contributions:
- Novel idea of nesting sparse networks within dense networks for easy deployment
- Iterative multi-level scheme to embed networks of different sparsities 
- Overhead-free approach by encoding sparsity masks within network weights
- Empirical validation of the approach on ImageNet, CIFAR datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 ELSA is a technique to embed one or more sparse networks within a single dense network, allowing easy deployment of multiple sparsity levels at prediction time without loss of accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting ELSA (Efficient Layer Sparsification Approach), a technique for constructing one or more sparse networks as embedded subsets within a single dense network. Specifically:

- ELSA allows extracting multiple fully trained sparse networks with different sparsity levels from a single dense network at deployment/prediction time. This provides flexibility to adapt to different hardware constraints without needing to store or download multiple models.

- The extracted sparse networks are identical to ones explicitly trained, allowing state-of-the-art accuracy without fine-tuning. 

- ELSA is modular and can leverage any existing network sparsification techniques within its framework. It puts no restrictions on loss functions, architectures, or optimization methods.

- Experiments show ELSA introduces negligible reduction in prediction quality compared to training sparse networks independently, while providing the advantages of easy storage and deployment.

In summary, the main contribution is enabling flexible one-shot pruning to variable sparsity levels from a single dense network, with no accuracy loss compared to individually trained sparse models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using any existing network sparsification technique within ELSA. What are some advanced sparsification techniques that could further improve the accuracy-sparsity trade-off when used within ELSA?

2. Could iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) be used instead of gradual magnitude pruning (GMP) within ELSA? What might be the advantages and disadvantages? 

3. How does the choice of densification technique impact the final accuracy of the dense network produced by ELSA? Is it better to use the same optimization method or vary it?

4. The paper hypothesizes that suboptimal hyperparameter choices during densification could explain cases where the final dense network has lower accuracy than the initial one. What experiments could be done to validate this? 

5. For the multi-level version of ELSA, is there an optimal sequencing of sparsity levels that leads to the best final accuracy? Or does the order not really matter?

6. Could ELSA be extended to not just freeze weight values but also freeze the signs of weights after sparsification? Would this provide any benefits?

7. The paper stores sparsity counters directly in the weight values to avoid any storage overhead. Does this cause any rounding issues or quantization effects that impact accuracy?

8. How does the performance of ELSA-nets compare when extracted on the fly versus storing the separate sparse networks? Is streaming extraction more efficient?

9. For batchnorm statistics, could conditional computation be used to only compute and store statistics for network layers that will be used rather than separately storing all of them?

10. Could ELSA be applied in more complex continual learning settings with new tasks/domains? How would the freezing interact with catastrophic forgetting in that case?
