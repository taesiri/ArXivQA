# [Generalizing from a few environments in safety-critical reinforcement   learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01475)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can reinforcement learning agents generalize safely and avoid catastrophes when deployed in novel environments, after training on only a limited number of environments?

The key points related to this question are:

- The paper investigates safety and generalization in RL when there are only a few training environments available. 

- Standard RL algorithms can fail dangerously in novel test environments, even if they perform perfectly during training.

- The paper examines some simple modifications to RL algorithms, like model ensembling and blocking classifiers, that can help reduce catastrophes in novel environments.

- The modifications are tested in gridworld environments and the more challenging CoinRun environment.

- In CoinRun, the ensemble's uncertainty information is useful for predicting impending catastrophes and allowing intervention.

So in summary, the main research question is about improving safety and generalization in RL from limited training environments, which is investigated through algorithm modifications and uncertainty-based catastrophe prediction. The goal is to avoid failures and catastrophes when deployed in new environments not seen during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This appears to be a LaTeX template for a conference paper submission, not a full paper. Based on the placeholder title and author information, it seems the intent is for this to be filled in with details of an actual paper submission. The template itself does not contain enough content to summarize a main contribution or ideas. Some key things I notice about the template:

- It is set up for a submission to NeurIPS 2019 based on the documentclass and comments. 

- There are some common LaTeX packages included like hyperref, booktabs, amsmath etc. as well as some machine learning specific ones like algorithmic.

- There are commands defined for author comments throughout the paper text.

- The template contains placeholder content for a title, authors, abstract, introduction section, and basic bibliography. 

- But there is no actual paper content included beyond these placeholders.

So in summary, this just provides a starting structure and format for writing a NeurIPS conference paper, but does not contain an actual paper with research content that I can summarize. The authors would need to add in details of their method, experiments, results etc. to turn this into a full paper draft. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in deep reinforcement learning and safe generalization:

- The problem setting of training on a limited number of environments and generalizing to new unseen environments is quite common in RL research. This paper does a nice job clearly defining the training/test split at the environment level rather than individual transitions.

- The focus on safety and avoiding catastrophic failures even when performance may be imperfect is an important one for real-world applications. Many RL papers focus only on maximizing rewards.

- Using simple modifications like ensembling and classifiers to try to reduce catastrophes builds off prior work using these techniques separately. Evaluating them systematically on the safety problem is a useful contribution.

- Examining both simple gridworld environments and the more complex CoinRun environment provides a range of testing scenarios. CoinRun is a benchmark environment designed specifically for evaluating generalization.

- The CoinRun results suggest ensemble methods don't reduce catastrophes much in that environment. But the authors show the uncertainty information can still be useful for predicting upcoming catastrophes. This type of analysis and insight is valuable.

- Overall, the paper makes incremental but solid contributions validating the difficulty of safe generalization in RL, and providing some evidence for techniques that can help. The analysis seems competent, if not groundbreaking.

To summarize, the paper addresses an important real-world issue in RL using fairly standard techniques. It provides a solid empirical analysis, especially highlighting the challenges of avoiding non-local catastrophes. The work is a useful addition to the literature on safe RL generalization, though not necessarily revolutionary.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other methods for improving safety and generalization beyond the ones investigated in this paper. The authors tested some simple techniques like ensembling, dropout, and blocking classifiers, but there may be other more sophisticated methods that could help.

- Testing the approaches on more complex and realistic environments beyond the gridworlds and CoinRun used in this paper. The authors mention this is an important direction to see if the findings hold more broadly.

- Investigating different ways to leverage uncertainty information, beyond just predicting impending catastrophes. The authors showed uncertainty can help predict catastrophes in CoinRun, but suggest uncertainty could potentially be used in other ways too.

- Exploring how different amounts and types of training environments affect safety generalization. The authors experimented with varying numbers of training environments, but suggest more analysis could be done on this factor.

- Developing theoretical understandings of when and why generalization fails in terms of safety. The paper empirically demonstrated failures, but developing formal theory could further illuminate these issues.

- Consider alternative problem formulations beyond the split between train and test environments. The authors suggest relaxing this hard split could be worthwhile to explore.

- Applying and testing the ideas in real-world applications, like robotics and autonomous vehicles. The authors emphasize deployment in real environments as an important next step.

So in summary, the key directions seem to be exploring additional methods, testing in more complex and real environments, developing theory, and making use of uncertainty information beyond just predicting catastrophes. The authors lay out a research agenda for making progress on safety and generalization in reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates safety and generalization in deep reinforcement learning when training on a limited number of environments. The authors find that standard deep RL algorithms can fail catastrophically when deployed on unseen test environments, even if they perform perfectly on the training environments. They experiment with modifications to DQN in gridworld environments, including model averaging, dropout, and using a classifier to block catastrophic actions. These modifications significantly reduce catastrophes, especially when few training environments are available. In the more challenging CoinRun environment, model averaging provides little benefit for reducing catastrophes. However, the uncertainty information from an ensemble of agents can help predict ahead of time whether a catastrophe will occur within a few steps, allowing the agent to request human intervention. Overall, the paper demonstrates that deep RL algorithms do not naturally generalize safely from limited experience, but modifications like ensembling and blocking classifiers can help, as can using uncertainty to predict upcoming dangers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates safety and generalization in deep reinforcement learning when training on a limited number of environments. The authors first experiment with gridworld environments, where the agent must reach a goal while avoiding lava cells. They find that standard DQN algorithms fail dangerously even when training on 1000 environments, with many catastrophic outcomes on test environments. Modifications like model averaging, dropout regularization, and a "blocking classifier" all significantly reduce test catastrophes. 

The authors then study the more challenging CoinRun environment, where dangers are non-local - an action can lead to a catastrophe several steps later. Here, model averaging does not significantly reduce catastrophes over a PPO agent baseline. However, the ensemble model uncertainties can help predict impending catastrophes within a few steps. This allows the agent to request human intervention and improve safety. Overall, the paper provides analysis and techniques for improving safety and generalization in RL when only limited training environments are available.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes using modifications to standard deep Q-learning methods to improve safety and generalization when training reinforcement learning agents on a limited number of environments. The key methods investigated are:

- Model averaging using an ensemble of independently trained Q-networks to get more robust Q-value estimates. 

- Adding a "blocking" classifier that is trained to recognize catastrophic state-action pairs and prevent the agent from selecting those actions.

- Combining the ensemble and blocking classifier to leverage both approaches.

These methods are evaluated in gridworld experiments, where they significantly reduce catastrophic failures on test environments compared to a standard DQN baseline, even when trained on very few environments. On the more challenging CoinRun platform, model averaging helps little but the uncertainty captured in the ensemble is shown to be useful for predicting impending catastrophes and requesting human intervention. Overall, the work provides insights into improving safety and generalization in RL from limited experience.
