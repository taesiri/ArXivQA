# [Joint Video Multi-Frame Interpolation and Deblurring under Unknown   Exposure Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15043)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform joint video multi-frame interpolation and deblurring under unknown exposure time. 

Specifically, the paper aims to tackle the challenging task of reconstructing a high framerate sharp video from a low framerate blurred video where the exposure time is unknown and varies across frames. The unknown and varying exposure time makes this problem very difficult, as traditional methods assume a fixed known exposure time.

The key hypothesis is that by learning an exposure-aware feature representation and using it to adapt computations in the motion analyzer and reconstruction network, the model can handle varying levels of blur and motion better. The exposure-aware features allow the model to adapt to different exposure settings and motion patterns.

In summary, this paper proposes a new method called VIDUE to address the problem of joint video interpolation and deblurring without knowing the true underlying exposure time, which is more realistic for real-world videos. The main novelty is in learning to adapt the model computations to estimated exposure features.
