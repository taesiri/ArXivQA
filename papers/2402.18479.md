# [NewsQs: Multi-Source Question Generation for the Inquiring Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for a dataset that can teach machines to answer open-ended questions about events and people in the news by drawing information from multiple news articles. 
- Existing datasets are lacking in one or more key components needed: clusters of related news articles, relevant questions covering those articles, and detailed answers to those questions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a new dataset called NewsQs by augmenting an existing multi-document summarization dataset called Multi-News with automatically generated questions. 
- Multi-News contains clusters of related news articles and human-written summaries. The authors use it as a base and pivot to a question generation task to add the missing questions component.
- They fine-tune a T5-Large language model on a small dataset of 1200 question-answer pairs from FAQ-style news articles to generate questions.
- They experiment with control codes during fine-tuning to encourage questions relevant to the entire summary paragraph.

Main Contributions:
- NewsQs - a dataset of 21,000 high-quality question-answer pairs over clusters of news documents.
- A method to leverage two existing datasets with only 2 out of 3 key components to create a complete dataset.
- Fine-tuning method with control codes that generates better questions according to human evaluation. 
- Carefully designed human evaluation protocol to enable quality assessment of the long text.

The paper makes good progress towards creating a multi-document question-answering dataset for the news domain. The question generation approach and human evaluation design are creative solutions to the key challenges. Overall, NewsQs seems a valuable new resource for research in query-based multi-document summarization.
