# [NewsQs: Multi-Source Question Generation for the Inquiring Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for a dataset that can teach machines to answer open-ended questions about events and people in the news by drawing information from multiple news articles. 
- Existing datasets are lacking in one or more key components needed: clusters of related news articles, relevant questions covering those articles, and detailed answers to those questions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a new dataset called NewsQs by augmenting an existing multi-document summarization dataset called Multi-News with automatically generated questions. 
- Multi-News contains clusters of related news articles and human-written summaries. The authors use it as a base and pivot to a question generation task to add the missing questions component.
- They fine-tune a T5-Large language model on a small dataset of 1200 question-answer pairs from FAQ-style news articles to generate questions.
- They experiment with control codes during fine-tuning to encourage questions relevant to the entire summary paragraph.

Main Contributions:
- NewsQs - a dataset of 21,000 high-quality question-answer pairs over clusters of news documents.
- A method to leverage two existing datasets with only 2 out of 3 key components to create a complete dataset.
- Fine-tuning method with control codes that generates better questions according to human evaluation. 
- Carefully designed human evaluation protocol to enable quality assessment of the long text.

The paper makes good progress towards creating a multi-document question-answering dataset for the news domain. The question generation approach and human evaluation design are creative solutions to the key challenges. Overall, NewsQs seems a valuable new resource for research in query-based multi-document summarization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents NewsQs, a new dataset of 21,000 high-quality question-answer pairs automatically generated from news document clusters, which can enable future work in query-based multi-document summarization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A dataset called NewsQs containing 21,000 high-quality question-answer pairs for multiple news documents.

2) A method for using two existing datasets (Multi-News and News on the Web), each containing two of the three necessary components (documents, questions, answers), to create NewsQs which contains all three.

3) Experiments showing that fine-tuning T5-Large with control codes produces better quality questions compared to fine-tuning without control codes, as measured by human evaluation. The control codes encourage the model to generate questions relevant to the entire summary/answer paragraph.

So in summary, the authors have created a new multi-document QA dataset called NewsQs by augmenting an existing multi-document summarization dataset with high-quality machine generated questions. Their method leverages existing data sources in a novel way and produces questions that human evaluators find relevant and acceptable.

The key focus areas are multi-document summarization and question generation, with applications to building datasets for query-based summarization. The paper leverages existing resources in innovative ways and evaluates the output through detailed human studies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed approach of augmenting the Multi-News dataset with automatically generated questions enable using it for query-based multi-document summarization? What are the benefits of framing the task as question generation instead of directly collecting questions, answers, and documents?

2. Why was the T5 model chosen for question generation fine-tuning experiments compared to other sequence-to-sequence or language models? What modifications were made to the prompt engineering and fine-tuning process to generate better questions? 

3. The paper mentions experimenting with control codes during fine-tuning - can you explain this method? Why would adding control codes potentially help the model generate better quality questions?

4. What was the motivation behind breaking down the human evaluation task into sentence-level annotations? How did this design choice aim to reduce the cognitive load for annotators? 

5. Can you discuss the quantitative analysis done using ranking and scores from the human evaluation results? What conclusions can be drawn about the quality of questions from the control codes fine-tuning compared to vanilla fine-tuning?

6. Why was the QNLI model used for automatic evaluation instead of metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore? What threshold was set on QNLI scores to filter the final dataset?

7. What ethical considerations were kept in mind regarding the team recruited for human evaluation? How was payment and task instructions designed to ensure fair and ethical treatment?

8. What are some limitations of using the Multi-News dataset as a base for NewsQs? Could potential errors or biases propagate from Multi-News into NewsQs?

9. How large is the final NewsQs dataset in terms of number of questions? What is the average length of questions and answers? Does NewsQs compare favorably to existing datasets for query-based multi-document summarization?

10. Could the proposed fine-tuning method and use of control codes work for question generation with other long-form summarization datasets? What challenges might arise in trying to adapt this approach to other domains or datasets?
