# [Zero-shot Explainable Mental Health Analysis on Social Media by   incorporating Mental Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mental health analysis on social media faces challenges like need for large labeled datasets, limited interpretability, and lack of scientific basis. 
- Existing methods either rely on discriminative models which are not interpretable or generative models like LLMs which can generate unreliable explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-step method incorporating mental scales to enhance analysis:
   1) An LLM mimics user completing mental health questionnaires
   2) Another LLM analyzes the questionnaire responses to detect mental health issues
- Adds a discriminator LLM to evaluate quality of scale completion and analysis
- Aims to provide transparent and reliable analysis grounded in mental scales while utilizing ability of LLMs to infer traits from text

Main Contributions:
- First work to automatically complete mental health scales based on user text
- Shows LLMs can simulate human-like questionnaire completion with minimal user data, enhancing scientific basis without labels
- Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot and fine-tuning methods in weighted F1 score
- Provides more rigorous explanation by generating analysis grounded in mental scale outputs

In summary, this paper introduces a novel interpretable mental health analysis method that incorporates the established scientific nature of mental health questionnaires completed by an LLM with the latent ability of LLMs to understand user traits. This enhances analysis accuracy and interpretability without needing large labeled datasets.
