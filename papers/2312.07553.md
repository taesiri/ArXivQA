# [Hijacking Context in Large Multi-modal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper identifies a new vulnerability in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) called "context hijacking". This refers to when a small number of incoherent images or text descriptions in the context mislead the LMM to generate biased output about only that irrelevant context, disregarding the original coherent context.

- For example, in a visual storytelling task, if a sequence of 4 coherent image-text pairs are provided as context, the LMM can reasonably caption the final query image. However, adding just a single incoherent pair makes the LMM lose track of the original context and talk only about the irrelevant hijacked pair in its response.

- This is a critical reliability issue for real-world usage of LMMs which will likely encounter some distribution shift and irrelevant contexts in practice.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using GPT-4's few-shot prompting capability to pre-filter out irrelevant images/texts. GPT-4 can robustly stick to the majority context and ignore hijacked minority contexts when instructed.

- The filtered context can then be passed to the target LMM, enhancing its reliability by preventing context hijacking.

Further Investigation:
- The paper also explores an open question - whether reforming the hijacked context itself into a coherent one can improve LMM responses. 

- GPT-4 is used to rephrase incoherent text. DALL-E 3 generates corresponding coherent images. But limitations around style inconsistencies mean this currently has minimal positive impact.

Main Contributions:
- Identifying context hijacking as a major reliability issue for LMMs
- A simple yet effective filtering technique to suppress hijacked contexts using GPT-4 
- Investigation into reforming contexts, setting direction for future work


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies a vulnerability in large multimodal models where irrelevant images or captions can hijack the context and bias the model's responses, and proposes methods to filter or reform hijacked contexts using foundation models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Identifying a new problem of off-the-shelf large multi-modal models (LMMs), called context hijacking, where a small fraction of incoherent images or text descriptions can mislead the LMM to generate biased and incoherent responses. 

2) Proposing a straightforward remedy to suppress hijacked contexts by pre-filtering irrelevant contexts using GPT-4 and GPT-4V, which are more robust to distribution shifts in the context.

3) Investigating an open question of whether replacing hijacked contexts with coherent ones generated by GPT-4 and text-to-image models can help produce more coherent responses from LMMs. This promotes a new future research direction.

In summary, the paper identifies context hijacking as a major vulnerability of LMMs, and proposes both a simple filtering method to address it, as well as an investigation into replacing hijacked contexts to further improve coherency of LMM responses.

The paper introduces the problem of "context hijacking" in LMMs, where irrelevant visual or textual contexts can mislead the model and result in incoherent responses. The main approaches explored are filtering out irrelevant contexts using GPT-4/GPT-4V and reforming hijacked contexts using GPT-4 and text-to-image models. The goal is to improve the robustness and coherency of LMMs when faced with distribution shifts in the input contexts. Other key terms reflect the evaluation, analyses, and limitations around these core ideas.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a pre-filtering method to remove irrelevant contexts using GPT-4/GPT-4V. What are the key capabilities of GPT-4/GPT-4V that enable them to filter contexts effectively? How does few-shot prompting play a role?

2. The paper investigates replacing hijacked contexts with coherent ones using GPT-4 and DALL-E 3. What are the limitations found with this approach? What factors contribute to LMMs still exhibiting hijacked responses even after context replacement? 

3. The paper ablates the location of the hijacked context and shows it impacts coherency of LMM responses. What is the underlying reason that location matters? How can this insight be used to develop more robust LMMs?

4. The paper shows GPT-4V is more robust to hijacked contexts than other LMMs. What capabilities of GPT-4V contribute to this robustness? How can this robustness be transferred to other LMMs?

5. What other techniques beyond filtering and replacement could be explored to address the context hijacking issue? For example, could adversarial training play a role?  

6. Could the context hijacking problem be addressed during pre-training of LMMs? What modifications to the training objective or procedure could impart robustness?

7. The reforming hijacked contexts method uses a text-to-image model to generate corresponding images. How sensitive is coherence of final LMM responses to the quality and realism of these generated images?

8. What metrics could be used to quantitatively evaluate context hijacking and the efficacy of proposed solutions? What are challenges in constructing a robust quantitative evaluation?  

9. Could intermediate representations in LMMs be analyzed to identify when context hijacking is occurring? How could this enable more targeted interventions?

10. The paper studies context hijacking on a visual story telling dataset. How transferrable are findings and solutions to other modalities (e.g. video) and tasks (e.g. visual dialog)?
