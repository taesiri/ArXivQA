# Generating Persona Consistent Dialogues by Exploiting Natural Language   Inference

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate persona consistent dialogues by exploiting natural language inference (NLI) techniques. Specifically, the paper proposes a method to address the lack of persona consistency in existing persona-based dialogue models. The key ideas are:- Formulate the task as a reinforcement learning problem, where an NLI model provides reward signals to guide a persona-based generator to produce more consistent responses.- Use an adversarial training framework with two evaluator modules - a naturalness module and a consistency module based on NLI. - Exploit different NLI models (a simple baseline and BERT fine-tuned on NLI data) to provide the consistency reward signal.- Evaluate both naturalness and consistency of generated dialogues, using automatic metrics and human evaluations.The central hypothesis is that by exploiting NLI techniques to provide training signals, the model can learn to generate more persona consistent dialogues, while maintaining response quality. The results generally confirm this hypothesis, with the proposed model outperforming baselines on consistency metrics while maintaining good performance on naturalness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:- The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for generating persona consistent dialogues. This addresses the challenge of training objectives needing to be differentiable in persona-based dialogue models.- The paper exploits natural language inference (NLI) techniques to enhance the generation of persona consistent dialogues. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to use NLI in this way for persona consistency.- The paper shows experimentally that the proposed approach outperforms strong generative baselines, especially in terms of persona-consistency according to both automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the main contribution is using reinforcement learning and NLI techniques to improve persona consistency in open-domain dialogue generation. The key innovation is exploiting NLI models to provide reward signals for training the generative model to produce more persona consistent responses. Evaluations demonstrate improvements over existing persona-based dialogue models.
