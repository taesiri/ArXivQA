# [Consecutive Model Editing with Batch alongside HooK Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) need to be frequently updated with new knowledge, but retraining them is very time- and resource-consuming. 
- Existing model editing methods have limitations such as requiring extra training of components like classifiers or meta networks, needing large external memory to store edit instances, or only supporting single-round editing instead of consecutive batch editing.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes COMEBA-HK, a consecutive and batch-supportive model editing method. 
- It introduces a memory-efficient transformer updating mechanism that supports consecutive batch editing by computing updates based on residual errors and accumulation of edited keys.
- Hook layers are proposed to separate weight changes from the original model weights. They identify the local editing scope using a simple yet effective outlier detection method on layer inputs.

Main Contributions:
- Supports consecutive batch editing, which is more practical but lacking in prior works. Enables editing over long sequences of edits.
- Memory-friendly as it only needs to store updated weights for hook layers instead of external memory of edit instances.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two datasets using GPT2-XL and GPT-J base models under both single-round and consecutive batch edit settings.
- Conducts detailed analyses and ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of different components and hyperparameters.
- Overall, proposes an effective and practical model editing solution for LLMs that is consecutive, batch-supportive and memory-friendly.

In summary, the paper addresses key limitations of existing model editing methods by introducing consecutive batch editing capabilities and a lightweight hook layer based approach. Extensive experiments and analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
