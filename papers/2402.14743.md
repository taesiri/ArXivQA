# [Dependency Annotation of Ottoman Turkish with Multilingual BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ottoman Turkish is a historical form of Turkish used in the Ottoman Empire until the early 20th century. It differs substantially from modern Turkish in vocabulary, grammar, and loanwords from Arabic/Persian.  
- There is a lack of NLP resources and annotated data for Ottoman Turkish, which hinders the ability to computationally process and analyze Ottoman texts. Manual annotation is time-consuming and requires expertise.

Proposed Solution:
- Create the first Ottoman Turkish dependency treebank that conforms to the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme. This will facilitate NLP of Ottoman texts.
- Use an iterative annotation process with a multilingual BERT parser to simplify the annotation task. Steps:
   1) Fine-tune parser on modern Turkish treebank
   2) Use parser to pseudo-annotate Ottoman data 
   3) Manually correct pseudo-annotations
   4) Further fine-tune parser on corrected Ottoman data
   5) Repeat steps 2-4 iteratively

Contributions:
- Analysis of challenges in annotating Ottoman syntax due to foreign structures and vocabulary
- Introduction of the iterative annotation methodology using BERT to ease the Ottoman treebank creation process
- Creation of initial treebank with 100 manually corrected sentences over two rounds of annotation 
- Evaluation showing the parsing model improves at predicting dependencies but drops slightly in labeling accuracy between rounds. More data needed for fine-tuning.
- The resulting Ottoman Turkish treebank will enable better NLP of Ottoman texts and study of Ottoman language.

In summary, the paper presents an iterative annotation approach using BERT for creating the first Ottoman Turkish dependency treebank. This historical treebank will facilitate computational analysis of Ottoman heritage, overcoming hurdles in working with this low-resource language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an iterative annotation methodology using a multilingual BERT model to simplify the creation of the first Universal Dependencies treebank for Ottoman Turkish, a historical form of Turkish, in order to facilitate natural language processing of Ottoman texts and gain deeper linguistic insights.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an iterative annotation methodology that utilizes a multilingual BERT-based parsing model to simplify and speed up the manual annotation process for constructing the first Ottoman Turkish dependency treebank. 

Specifically, the key points are:

1) They introduce an iterative approach that involves:
- Using a BERT parser to pseudo-annotate Ottoman Turkish data 
- Manually correcting the pseudo-annotations
- Fine-tuning the BERT parser with the corrections
- Using the updated parser to pseudo-annotate more data

2) They show experimentally that this methodology eases the challenging task of manually annotating dependency relations in Ottoman Turkish by providing the annotators a good starting point.

3) They discuss various linguistic challenges encountered during the annotation process for Ottoman Turkish, such as foreign structures and words.

4) They aim to release the resulting Ottoman Turkish treebank as part of the Universal Dependencies project, which will facilitate NLP analysis of Ottoman Turkish texts.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating an iterative annotation framework that leverages multilingual BERT to simplify the construction of the first Ottoman Turkish dependency treebank.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Ottoman Turkish - The historical form of Turkish language that was used in the Ottoman Empire. The paper focuses on creating resources and treebanks for this language.

- Dependency annotation - The process of annotating the grammatical structure of sentences, especially syntactic dependencies. The paper describes the creation of a dependency treebank for Ottoman Turkish.

- Universal Dependencies (UD) - A framework for cross-linguistically consistent grammatical annotation. The Ottoman Turkish treebank will be part of the UD project. 

- Iterative annotation - An approach where models are used to pseudo-annotate data, humans correct it, models are improved with corrected data, and the process repeats. This is used to ease the annotation process.

- Multilingual BERT - A pretrained large language model that is fine-tuned for dependency parsing. It is used as the base model in the iterative annotation process.

- Low-resource languages - Languages with limited availability of annotated datasets and other language resources. Ottoman Turkish is considered as such.

- Historical languages - Languages that are no longer in use, such as those used in past empires. The paper focuses on building resources for the historical Ottoman Turkish language.

Some other related terms are treebanks, syntactic relations, attachment scores, annotation challenges, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the key challenges encountered in the syntactic annotation of Ottoman Turkish texts as outlined in Section 3.3? Explain each challenge with relevant examples. 

2. How does the proposed iterative annotation methodology utilizing multilingual BERT help address the challenges in annotating Ottoman Turkish texts? Elaborate on the process and how the model gets updated in each iteration.

3. What are the differences in vocabulary and grammar between modern Turkish and Ottoman Turkish that pose difficulties in directly applying modern NLP techniques? Provide some examples illustrating the differences. 

4. The paper mentions utilizing the Suggested UD Guidelines for Turkish in some cases during annotation. In what aspects does the annotation scheme for Ottoman Turkish diverge from the Universal Dependencies conventions?

5. What could be the possible reasons behind the slight drop in labeled attachment score for the second batch compared to the first batch as observed in Table 2? Analyze the differences between the two batches.  

6. Persian grammatical structures constitute around 20% of the noun phrases in the second batch while only 3% in the first batch. How could this disproportion affect the parsing model's performance in correctly identifying dependency types?

7. The average sentence length is longer for the second batch than the first. How could this factor potentially make the annotation more challenging in the second batch?

8. With only 50 manually annotated sentences utilized for fine-tuning in each iteration, could the size of fine-tuning data impact model performance? Justify your answer.

9. How can the iterative annotation approach provide insights into the difficulties of annotating Ottoman texts in a progressive manner? Explain with examples.

10. Once completed, how could the resulting Ottoman Turkish treebank facilitate more effective NLP of Ottoman texts and help explore Ottoman linguistic nuances?
