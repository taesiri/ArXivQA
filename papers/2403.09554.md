# [Cloud gap-filling with deep learning for improved grassland monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optical satellite image time series (e.g. from Sentinel-2) are crucial for timely monitoring of agricultural lands. However, cloud cover often disrupts the continuity of these time series, obstructing tasks like detection of grassland mowing events.
- Existing gap-filling methods using only optical data lack precision for tracking abrupt vegetation changes over long temporal gaps. SAR data offers weather-independent imagery but alone lacks detailed vegetation information.

Proposed Solution:
- A deep learning architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to integrate available Sentinel-2 NDVI images with weather-independent Sentinel-1 SAR/coherence time series.
- Goal is to generate continuous high-resolution NDVI time series and assess impact on detecting grassland mowing events.

Key Contributions:
1) CNN-RNN model to reconstruct NDVI time series at 6-day resolution by fusing Sentinel-1 and available Sentinel-2 data.
2) Evaluation showing proposed model outperforms optical-only gap-filling methods like linear/Akima interpolation across various metrics.
3) Assessing value of generated NDVI time series for improved grassland mowing detection. Proposed model filtering mitigates issues like false detections.
4) Model reliably recovers "hidden" mowing events obscured by clouds that rules-based methods miss without any interpolation.
5) Adaptation of architecture for mowing detection achieves 85% F1 score, exceeding baseline methods by over 6%.

In summary, the paper presents a deep learning methodology for fusing optical and radar satellite data to reconstruct vegetation index time series, overcoming disruption from cloud cover. Detailed experiments demonstrate value for agricultural monitoring through more accurate detection of abrupt grassland events.
