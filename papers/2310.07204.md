# [State of the Art on Diffusion Models for Visual Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07204)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to have a single central research question or hypothesis. Rather, it appears to be a broad review and summary of recent work on diffusion models for visual computing. Some of the key topics and themes covered in the paper include:

- Giving an overview of the mathematical foundations and theory behind diffusion models for image synthesis. The paper explains concepts like denoising score matching, noise schedules, etc. that form the core of diffusion model image generation.

- Reviewing recent advances in extending diffusion models beyond 2D image synthesis to video, 3D shapes, and 4D scenes. The paper discusses the unique challenges faced in these domains compared to 2D images, such as lack of training data, representing geometry, and modeling temporal consistency.

- Summarizing strategies for conditioning and controlling diffusion model generations, such as classifier guidance, classifier-free guidance, and prompt/feature editing. These allow steering the generative process.

- Surveying applications of diffusion models like image editing, video editing, avatar creation, etc. enabled by foundational capabilities like conditioning and inversion.

- Providing an overview of datasets, evaluation metrics, open challenges, and social implications around diffusion models.

So in summary, this appears to be a broad survey synthesizing recent work at the intersection of diffusion models and visual computing/graphics, rather than a paper focused on a specific hypothesis or research question. The goal seems to be providing a structured introduction and summary of this quickly evolving field for researchers and practitioners.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the challenge of extending text-to-image diffusion models to generate coherent and controllable videos. The key research questions are:

1. How can text-to-image diffusion models be adapted to model the temporal dynamics and dependencies in video data?

2. How can these video diffusion models be trained efficiently given the high dimensionality of video data? 

3. How can textual prompts and other conditioning inputs be used to control the generated video content?

4. How can video editing operations like style transfer or content manipulation be achieved while maintaining temporal coherence?

The authors propose several innovations to address these challenges:

- Extending image diffusion models to video by adding separable temporal layers (3D convolutions, temporal attention). This captures motion and temporal dependencies.

- Training strategies to leverage large unlabeled video corpora, transfer learning from pre-trained image models, and cascaded models for efficient high-resolution generation.

- Conditioning mechanisms through classifier guidance and cross-attention layers to align generated content with textual prompts.

- Video editing techniques based on feature manipulation and warping that maintain stylistic edits temporally consistent.

So in summary, this paper focuses on adapting diffusion models to controllable and scalable video generation while handling the unique complexities of high-dimensional video data. The core innovations are in model architecture, training strategies, conditioning methods, and consistency-preserving editing operations tailored for video.

Does this help summarize the key focus and contributions of the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method for video style transfer using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). The key contributions are:

1. They present a video style transfer method based on DDPMs. In contrast to previous style transfer methods that operate on individual frames, this approach uses a spatio-temporal diffusion model to capture style information across multiple frames. 

2. They propose a training strategy that allows leveraging a pre-trained image style transfer model to initialize the video style transfer model. This helps the video model converge faster and produce higher quality stylized videos.

3. They introduce a masked discriminator loss during training that helps preserve the original video content better while transferring the style. 

4. They empirically demonstrate that their spatio-temporal diffusion model produces videos with more coherent stylization across frames compared to frame-by-frame style transfer baselines. Quantitative and qualitative results on several datasets show the effectiveness of their approach.

5. Their method can transfer sophisticated artistic styles like painting and pencil sketching to videos in a temporally coherent manner, which is challenging for previous techniques.

In summary, the key idea is to extend image style transfer using DDPMs to the video domain by designing a spatio-temporal diffusion model and a training approach that leverages pre-trained image models. The proposed model better captures style information across frames leading to coherent stylized video generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of the paper is a novel method for video diffusion modeling that improves sample quality and diversity. Specifically, the key ideas are:

1. Introducing a video diffusion model architecture that factorizes over space and time. This allows the model to be trained efficiently on large-scale video datasets.

2. Using classifier-free guidance during sampling to improve sample quality. This helps ensure generated videos better match the conditioning text prompt. 

3. Jointly training the model on both videos and individual frames from multiple datasets. This improves sample diversity by exposing the model to more data.

4. Evaluation on a suite of automated metrics as well as human evaluations to demonstrate improved sample quality and diversity compared to baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an effective video diffusion modeling approach that leverages architectural innovations, sampling techniques, and diverse training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the text-to-video generation task. The proposed techniques help address key challenges in extending diffusion models to video, such as modeling spatio-temporal consistency and training on large-scale video data.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of video generation and editing with diffusion models:

- Compared to early video diffusion models like VDM and Make-a-Video, this paper utilizes more advanced techniques like latent diffusion and cascaded models to achieve higher resolution videos. This follows similar trends in the field towards latent diffusion and cascading for efficiency and quality.

- For controlled video generation, this paper relies primarily on conditioning approaches like ControlNet. Other recent works have explored more diversity in controls through sketches, poses, etc. Conditioning on spatial inputs is becoming common, but no single approach dominates yet.

- For video editing, this paper discusses fine-tuning on target videos, which can be slow and overfit. Alternative feature editing and warping techniques are gaining traction as they don't require per-video training and leverage pre-trained models. Consistency remains a challenge. 

- Compared to early video diffusion models trained from scratch, leveraging pretrained image models is now standard practice. This transfers powerful 2D priors to video.

- For metrics, this paper uses common proxies like FVD. More advanced metrics are needed to capture nuances like long-term consistency. Limited metrics make comparing video generation quality difficult.

- Data and compute limitations are still major bottlenecks for further progress. Large, diverse, labeled video datasets are scarce compared to images. Efficient architectures remain critical.

In summary, this paper follows many recent trends in video diffusion like latent modeling, transfer from images, and conditioning. Key open challenges include controls, consistency, metrics and data/compute constraints. More innovations in these areas could significantly advance the field.

\section{3D Object Generation}

Diffusion models have shown great promise for generating 2D images. However, generating 3D shapes and objects presents unique challenges not encountered in the 2D image domain. In this section, we provide an overview of recent work exploring the use of diffusion models for 3D object generation.

\subsection{Representations for 3D Shapes}

A key challenge is identifying suitable 3D representations for use in diffusion models. Common choices include:

- Point clouds
- Voxel grids 
- Meshes
- Implicit representations
  - Signed distance functions
  - Occupancy functions
  - Radiance fields

Each has tradeoffs in terms of memory, computational complexity, and suitability for learning and sampling. Voxel grids offer simplicity but scale poorly. Point clouds are lightweight but unstructured. Implicit representations have gained traction but require specialized sampling techniques during training and inference.

\subsection{Network Architectures}

The choice of 3D representation impacts network design. Early works adapted standard convolutional architectures by adding a third spatial dimension. However, 3D CNNs scale poorly. Recent approaches explore more specialized networks:

- Graph networks for point clouds
- Hierarchical and sparse data structures for voxels 
- MLP networks for implicit representations

These provide better computational scaling, but designing networks for 3D data remains an open challenge.

\subsection{Training Strategies}

3D training data is scarce compared to images, so various strategies are employed:

- Synthetic 3D shape datasets
- Multi-view supervision from images
- Hierarchical coarse-to-fine training
- Leveraging 2D image priors
  - 3D consistency losses 
  - Score distillation
- Weak 3D supervision 
  - Silhouettes
  - Depth maps

Combining synthetic 3D data with weaker forms of multi-view supervision is a popular semi-supervised approach.

\subsection{Conditioning and Control}

As with images, control over 3D shape generation is critical. Conditioning strategies include:

- Category labels
- Partial shapes
- Sketches
- Natural language
- Images (via CLIP)

However, paired text-shape data is limited. Using images as a proxy for text shows promise. Spatial constraints like cuboid bounding boxes also provide intuitive control.

\subsection{Inversion and Editing}

Similar to images, inverting 3D shapes to latents enables editing via manipulation in latent space. Challenges include:

- Finding accurate shape encodings
- Editing semantics without changing geometry
- Maintaining multi-view consistency

Instructions or style references provide control over editing. Optimization strategies like score distillation can refine edits.

\subsection{Applications}

- Text- or image-guided shape generation
- 3D shape retrieval
- Single-view 3D reconstruction
- 3D shape interpolation and analogies
- 3D shape editing and stylization
- Generating 3D avatars

\subsection{Open Challenges}

Key limitations and open problems include:

- Scalability of representations and networks
- Limited training data
- Controlling global structure
- Enforcing physical plausibility
- Handling topology changes
- Metrics for evaluating generations

Overall, diffusion models show promise for 3D generation but designing suitable 3D-aware representations and training strategies remains an open research problem.

\section{3D Scene Generation}

Extending diffusion models from objects to full 3D scenes is an active area of research. Challenges include:

\subsection{Scene Representations}

Common choices include:

- Sparse point-based (Point clouds, surfels)
- Volumetric (Voxels, radiance fields)
- Surface-based (Meshes, SDFs)
- Implicit (Radiance fields, SDFs)
- Neural scene graphs

Volumetric radiance fields balance detail with memory usage but require specialized rendering techniques.

\subsection{Capturing Structure} 

Key is representing both scene appearance and geometry. Strategies include:

- Separate geometry and appearance encodings
- Hybrid implicit-explicit representations
- Hierarchical and compositional modeling
- Learning from multi-view images

Explicit geometry helps capture layout and relationships while appearance models surface properties.

\subsection{Supervision Tradeoffs}

Scene data is even more limited than objects. Approaches use:

- Real scans
- Synthetic scenes
- Single or multi-view images
- Weak labels like segmentation  

Combining real and synthetic data is common. Images provide supervision even without 3D ground truth.

\subsection{Conditioning and Control}

Control is critical for useful generation. Options include:

- Text prompts
- Segmentation maps 
- Bounding boxes
- Sparse point clouds

Text offers high-level control but often lacks precision over layout. Explicit spatial input provides finer control.

\subsection{Applications}

- Text-to-scene generation
- Novel view synthesis
- Single-view 3D reconstruction
- Scene editing and composition
- Changing viewpoint, lighting, materials
- Virtual walkthroughs

\subsection{Open Challenges}

- Capturing complex relationships and physics
- Controlling global structure and layout
- Handling scene dynamics 
- Scaling generation and inference 
- Domain gaps between synthetic and real
- Generalizing across environments

Scene modeling requires understanding complex 3D relationships. Key challenges remain in handling complexity while providing user control.

\section{4D Generation}

Modeling non-rigid dynamics in 3D scenes over time requires new representations and training strategies.

\subsection{Dynamic Representations}

Popular choices include:

- Animated meshes
- Deformable radiance fields
- Neural motion fields
- 4D scene graphs
- Layered neural images

Balance is needed between compactness for efficiency while capturing non-rigid motions.

\subsection{Challenges}

Key difficulties include:

- Capturing non-rigid deformations
- Modeling topology changes
- Handling occlusions and disocclusions
- Large memory footprint
- Lack of suitable training data

Standard 3D representations like meshes struggle with non-rigidity. Volumetric radiance fields help but scale poorly.

\subsection{Human Motion Modeling}

Specific models target human motions:

- Parametric body models 
- Graph neural networks on joints
- Transformer networks on poses

These leverage skeletal structure and motion priors. Joint modeling of pose, shape, and appearance is important.

\subsection{Training Strategies} 

Data is even more limited than static 3D. Approaches use:

- Human motion capture
- Synthetic scenes
- 2D videos
- Weakly supervised images 

Leveraging 2D data helps, e.g. conditioning video generation on pose.

\subsection{Applications}

- Text or audio to motion generation
- Novel view synthesis of humans
- Editing body pose and motion
- Manipulating clothing, hair, accessories
- Animating avatars

Entertainment, telepresence, biomechanics are potential use cases.

\subsection{Open Challenges}

Major limitations include:

- Modeling complex non-rigid deformations
- Capturing topology changes
- Reasoning about occlusions
- Controlling motion and timing
- Evaluating quality and diversity
- Scaling generation

The core challenge remains modeling the tremendous complexity of non-rigid 3D scene dynamics over time.

\section{Conclusion}

This report has surveyed the landscape of diffusion models for visual content generation beyond 2D images. While diffusion models have been transformative for unconditional image generation, conditioning them on spatial inputs, extending to video, 3D shapes, and 4D scenes introduces new challenges not present in the 2D domain.

Innovations have been made in representations, network architectures, training strategies, conditioning approaches, and applications, but many open problems remain. Key challenges include scaling computation and memory to handle video and 3D data, designing networks to effectively model the spatial and temporal structure, handling non-rigid dynamics, providing control through conditioning, and evaluating the quality of generations.

However, rapid progress is being made through new models that build on image diffusion as initialization, that decompose high-dimensional data into more manageable forms, and that incorporate inductive biases like physics. While there is still much work to be done, diffusion models show immense promise to unlock new generative abilities across visual computing.

\section{Introduction}

- Generative models enable creating new content like images


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in video synthesis using diffusion models:

- This paper introduces a novel text-to-video diffusion model called Video Diffusion Models (VDM) that extends prior image diffusion models to generate videos from text prompts. Other works like Make-A-Video and Align-Your-Latents have also proposed video diffusion models, but VDM was one of the first large-scale models of its kind.

- The VDM model architecture uses separable 3D convolutions and a 3D U-Net backbone. This is a common pattern seen in other video diffusion models as well to factorize spatial and temporal processing. However, some differences exist in the specific architecture choices.

- VDM incorporates classifier-free guidance during sampling to improve sample quality. Other works have used similar guidance techniques, but classifier-free guidance was relatively novel at the time this paper was published.

- The model is trained on a large dataset of videos and images scraped from the web. Other works have used similar web-scale data or specialized datasets like Kinetics. The use of web-data reflects a trend of utilizing large unlabeled video corpora.

- This work focuses on open-ended video generation based on text prompts. Other concurrent works have focused more narrowly on tasks like text-driven video editing. So this can be seen as a more general-purpose video synthesis model.

- Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong improvements over prior work in metrics like FVD. However, VDM still produces some temporal inconsistencies compared to real videos. Improving temporal coherence remains an open challenge in video diffusion models.

In summary, this paper pioneered large-scale text-to-video generation using diffusion models. It proposed architectural innovations adopted by later works, while highlighting challenges like temporal consistency that are still being addressed today in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Developing better evaluation metrics for video generation models, especially for measuring temporal consistency/coherence. Current metrics like FVD focus on frame quality and short-term motion but don't adequately measure long-term consistency. 

- Exploring different conditional video generation settings beyond text-to-video, such as video prediction, video interpolation, video extrapolation, etc.

- Improving controllability of video generation models through conditioning signals like poses, audio, sketches, etc. Current models still lack fine-grained control.

- Reducing computational requirements for training and inference. Video models are still very expensive to train and slow to sample from.

- Enabling generation of longer, high-resolution videos. Current models are limited to low resolutions and short clip lengths. Architectures that can synthesize videos in a streaming manner could help.

- Combining the strengths of large-scale video diffusion models and 3D-aware generative models for true 4D generation with geometric consistency.

- Developing unsupervised and self-supervised techniques so models can continue to improve from ever-growing online video data.

- Studying social impacts of synthetic video generation and developing forensic techniques to detect fakes.

So in summary, some key open challenges are: better metrics, controllability, efficiency, scale, incorporating 3D reasoning, leveraging unlabeled data, and studying societal impacts.

\section{3D Diffusion} \label{sec:spatial}
\Authors{Lingjie, Peter, Yifan, Po, Ben}\\
Beyond videos, the advent of diffusion models has also ushered in a transformative era for visual computing in the domain of 3D content generation.
Although videos can be seen as 3D data (2D frames stacked sequentially in time), here we use the term ``3D'' to refer to spatial structure, i.e., 3D geometry.
While 3D scenes can be visually presented as 2D video content by rendering a scene from multiple viewpoints, the rendered videos differ from general video content in that they only contain camera motion (as long as there exists a single 3D-consistent scene geometry).
Generating this scene geometry (and the accompanying appearance or texture) is the primary focus of 3D generative tasks.

As elaborated in Sec.~\textcolor{red}{XXX}, the application of diffusion models to higher-dimensional data faces inherent difficulties, with data scarcity being particularly acute in the 3D domain.
Existing 3D datasets are not only orders of magnitude smaller than their 2D counterparts, but they also exhibit wide variations in quality and complexity (see Sec.~\textcolor{red}{XXX}). Many of the available datasets focus on individual objects with limited detail and texture, limiting their generalization and usefulness for practical applications. Fundamentally, this issue stems from the fact that 3D content cannot be captured (or created) with the same ease as an image or video, resulting in orders of magnitude less total data. Furthermore, the culture for sharing 3D content is nowhere near that for 2D, exacerbating the scarcity of annotated data.

A unique challenge specific to 3D diffusion is the lack of a standardized 3D data representation.
Unlike in image and video processing, where consensus has emerged around certain data formats, the 3D field is still wrestling with multiple competing representations, i.e.,~meshes, points, voxels, and implicit functions, each with its own merits and limitations, and each necessitating different network designs. Yet, none has emerged as a definitive solution that balances scalability with granularity.

To navigate these complexities, this section considers two distinct approaches: 1) \emph{Direct 3D Generation via Diffusion Models}, which aims to model the distribution of 3D shapes, such that 3D content can be generated directly, putting geometry at the forefront and potentially serving as a foundation for tasks like 3D reconstruction and shape retrieval; and 2) \emph{Multiview 2D-to-3D Generation via Diffusion Models}, which offers a more practical route by leveraging high-quality 2D generative models to create textured, consumer-ready 3D content.
Both approaches offer valuable insights and capabilities, each addressing different facets of the challenges and opportunities in 3D content generation via diffusion models.

\subsection{Direct 3D Generation via Diffusion Models}\label{sec:direct-3d-generation}
%\Authors{Yifan, Peter}.

Due to the aforementioned challenges inherent to 3D data representation and spatial reasoning, in the realm of ``Direct 3D Generation via Diffusion Models'', the design space is notably intricate, necessitating a nuanced exploration of various design factors that significantly distinguish existing methodologies.
Unlike the domains of image and video processing, where standardized data representations and architectures have emerged as clear front-runners, the field of 3D content generation is still grappling with the absence of a "one-size-fits-all" solution.
This has led to a diverse array of design choices, each with its own merits and limitations. The ensuing discussion will systematically explore these pivotal design vectors, elucidating their impact on the quality and applicability of generated 3D content.
\Cref{tab:geometry_gen_summary} provides a comprehensive summary of the methods reviewed herein.

\paragraph*{Type of Output.}
The first way to distinguish different methods is to look at the type of output they generate.
Current methods either generate object-level geometry, object-level geometry and appearance, or scene-level geometry and appearance (see Fig.~\ref{fig:example-direct-3D} for an example of the output).
The choice of output type is often dictated by the type of data that is available for training.
Many works~\cite{luo_diffusion_2021,zhou_3d_2021,hui_neural_2022,zheng_locally_2023,zeng_lion_2022,cheng_sdfusion_2023,erkocc2023hyperdiffusion,li_diffusion-sdf_2023,shue_3d_2023,zhang_3dshape2vecset_2023} make use of the few existing large-scale 3D datasets, such as ShapeNet~\cite{chang2015shapenet}, which include object-scale synthetic 3D models with geometry and material provided.
These works use these datasets to investigate various design choices to adapt 2D diffusion models to 3D content; they have demonstrated the potential of diffusion models for 3D generation
by generating satisfying geometric details---as the training data permits.
However, due to the limited size, diversity, and complexity of the data, the applicability of these methods in practice is relatively low.
Especially the lack of diversity and appearance information is a major limitation.
To address this, several works, including \cite{nichol_point-e_2022,jun2023shap,gupta_3dgen_2023,zhao2023michelangelo}, have started to use more complex datasets, most notably~\cite{reizenstein2021common,objaverse,ObjaverseXL} with in-the-wild objects and their appearance.

More recently, several authors have started to explore the generation of large indoor and outdoor 3D scenes.
The scale and complexity of these scenes are much higher than the object-level datasets, though, the diversity is still limited.
Interestingly, likely due to the lack of accurate 3D ground truth and/or suitable architectures to process large-scale 3D structures, existing scene-level generation methods~\cite{bautista2022gaudi,kim2023neuralfield} opt to generate video renderings of the scene, which includes both the static 3D scene and the camera trajectory.
While this is seemingly harder than generating the 3D scene only, due to the additional output mode, these approaches can conveniently hide low-quality geometry through visually plausible textures and appearance.
Normally, the generated 3D scenes are coarse and incomplete, which leads to uncanny warping effects in the generated video, creating an illusion that the shape is deforming over time.
In addition, the generated scenes are still relatively simple and lack the diversity and complexity of real-world scenes.

\paragraph*{3D Shape Representation.}
Given the type of output, there can be multiple suitable representations, for example, point clouds, voxels, meshes, continuous or discrete samples of signed distance functions (SDFs), occupancy, and  radiance fields.
The concrete choice is related to the type of output.
For object-level geometry, points, meshes, occupancy and SDFs---both as continuous functions or discrete samples---are common choices.
When appearance is also generated, points and meshes can be augmented with per-point colors~\cite{nichol_point-e_2022} and textures~\cite{gupta_3dgen_2023}, and the occupancy and signed distance function can also be augmented with texture field to form some variations of radiance field~\cite{jun2023shap,zhao2023michelangelo}.
For scene-scale outputs, due to the lack of high-quality data in points and meshes representations and relatively easier acquisition in RGBD format, radiance fields become a more viable choice.

\paragraph*{Diffusion Space.}
One very important way to differentiate the existing frameworks is based on the representation they employ inside the diffusion process.
A natural choice is to apply the diffusion process directly to the 3D shape representation.
The most popular representation in this category is points~\cite{luo_diffusion_2021,zhou_3d_2021} and voxelized occupancy and SDF~\cite{zheng_locally_2023}, as the former can be conveniently linked to the physics interpretation of diffusion models with Langevin dynamics and the latter, deploying voxel structures, can take advantage of tested 2D


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the video diffusion paper suggest a few interesting future research directions:

- Developing better evaluation metrics for temporal consistency in videos: Existing metrics like FVD mainly measure frame-level realism and short-term motion dynamics but do not adequately capture long-term inconsistencies over the course of a video. New metrics are needed.

- Exploring other conditioning modalities beyond text prompts: For example, conditioning on audio, actions, interactive user inputs etc. to enable more controllable video generation.

- Combining explicit 3D scene representations into the video generation process to improve multi-view consistency and enable controllable camera motion.

- Reducing computational costs of video diffusion models to make training and inference more practical. This could involve more efficient architectures, distillation techniques, or strategies like hierarchical generation.

- Improving video quality through advancements in underlying 2D image generation techniques. Transferring image generation advancements to the video domain remains an open challenge. 

- Enabling interactive video editing capabilities by developing inversion techniques to map real videos into the latent space for manipulation.

- Exploring semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques to train on large amounts of unlabeled video data.

- Studying the societal impacts of synthetic video generation and developing forensic techniques to detect manipulated content.

So in summary, they highlight needs for better evaluation metrics, more diverse conditioning approaches, integration of 3D representations, reducing computational costs, improving video quality building on image generation advancements, developing video inversion and editing techniques, using unlabeled data more effectively, and studying societal impacts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper discusses several key open research challenges and future directions for video diffusion models:

Metrics for Temporal Consistency: Developing better quantitative metrics to evaluate the temporal consistency and realism of generated videos is an important open problem. Existing metrics like FVD focus on per-frame quality and short-term motion, but fail to capture long-term consistency. New metrics need to be designed to address this.

Long-range Dependencies: Current video diffusion models struggle to capture long-range dependencies beyond a few seconds. New architectures are needed to model longer-term structure and global context in videos spanning minutes or hours. Ideas from video transformers could help here.

Controllability: Precisely controlling the generated video content over both space and time remains difficult. Future work should aim to provide more fine-grained control through conditioning signals and interfaces. This could build on image control techniques like ControlNet.

Hierarchical Models: Two-stage hierarchical models that first generate a coarse overall structure, then refine details, could be beneficial. This helps with long videos and could aid controllability. Cascaded models like Imagen Video demonstrate early progress.

3D Structure and Geometry: Imposing 3D geometric constraints during video generation would improve realism and enable new applications like free-viewpoint video. Explicitly modeling videos as rendered 3D scenes is a promising direction being explored.

Data and Training: As always, larger and higher-quality video datasets would enable training more powerful models. Semi-supervised techniques leveraging unlabeled video could help with data efficiency. Reduced training costs through distillation or efficient architectures are also important to scale up.

In summary, the key open challenges are designing better metrics, modeling long-range structure, achieving fine-grained control, imposing 3D constraints, and developing more efficient training regimes. Building video generation systems that can produce high-fidelity, controllable results for long, complex videos remains an open problem requiring continued research.

\section{Spatial Generation}\label{sec:spatial}
In this section, we discuss diffusion models for \emph{spatial} generative tasks, i.e. 3D objects, or larger 3D scenes. While videos can be seen as 3D data (2D frames stacked sequentially in time), here we use the term ``3D'' to refer to spatial structure, i.e. 3D geometry. While 3D scenes can be visually presented as 2D video content by moving a camera through the scene, the rendered videos differ from general video content in that they only contain camera motion, not object motion within a single 3D scene. Thus, the problems of generating this scene geometry (and the accompanying appearance or texture) are the focus when discussing 3D generation.

\subsection{Multi-view Consistency and Novel View Synthesis}

For many applications, we desire not just a single rendered view of a 3D object or scene, but multiple rendered views that are consistent, i.e. appear to show the same underlying 3D structure from different viewpoints. This is a requirement for applications like mixed reality or free viewpoint video, where we need to render novel views not contained in the input dataset. Enforcing consistency across multiple rendered views is also beneficial even for single-view training data, since it provides a powerful inductive bias that enables learning stronger 3D generative priors useful for tasks like 3D-aware image manipulation.

\paragraph{Single-view training}
Many recent works have demonstrated surprisingly effective view synthesis starting even from only single input views of each scene. To accomplish this, they... 

\paragraph{Explicit camera pose conditioning}

In these approaches, a pair of views of the same scene are fed into two "arms" of a network which are joined through.... By training these networks on pairs or triplets of views from each scene, they learn stronger inductive biases for view consistency without needing pose information explicitly.

Example works include...

\paragraph{Self-supervised pose estimation}
A complementary line of work aims to extract pose information in a self-supervised manner during the generative process. Instead of requiring known poses as input, these techniques simultaneously...

Some examples are...

\paragraph{Differentiable rendering}
An alternative to using multiple views as input is to train generative models to reproduce a set of input views through differentiable rendering. In this paradigm, a generator implicitly represents a 3D scene, which is rendered using a differentiable renderer to produce.... By comparing rendered views against input views, 3D consistency is imposed without needing to specify...

Read the following excerpt discussing social implications and ethics of generative AI, then write 2-3 paragraphs summarizing the key issues:

Generative AI enables creating synthetic media like images, videos, audio, and text that are increasingly realistic and difficult to distinguish from real content. This raises important social implications and ethical considerations:

- Harmful content: Generative models could be used to produce offensive, violent, or explicit synthetic media without consent. Systems should have safety guards to prevent generating unsafe content.

- Misinformation: Highly realistic synthesized content could also enable the production of fake news and forged media like DeepFakes to intentionally deceive. This could have serious consequences if deployed at scale. 

- Copyright and legal issues: Training datasets likely contain copyrighted or private information without consent. Laws and policies lag behind the rapid progress in this space.

- Bias and fairness: Biases in data propagate to models, which can further marginalize underrepresented groups. Responsible development is critical.

- Privacy: Generative models may expose individuals' private data embedded in their training sets or enable unwanted surveillance. Approaches to preserve privacy must be researched.

- Economics: Widespread deployment of generative models could significantly disrupt industries like design, photography, and content creation. But they also create new opportunities. Managing this transition responsibly is an open challenge.

- Human well-being: Overuse of synthetic media as a substitute for real human connection may negatively impact mental health and social cohesion. Moderation is prudent.

- Security: Malicious actors could exploit generative models, for example to automate phishing attacks. Defenses are needed to maintain public safety.

- Explainability and accountability: The inner workings of complex generative models are opaque. Lack of interpretability limits accountability. Progress in explainable AI would enable oversight.

In summary, while offering immense creative potential, these models require thoughtful oversight to mitigate risks of misuse. Researchers, companies, and policymakers must collaborate to develop ethical norms and safety practices for responsible advancement of this transformative technology.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper "Video Diffusion Models":

The paper introduces Video Diffusion Models (VDMs), which are an extension of image diffusion models to the video domain. VDMs model the complex spatio-temporal structure of videos using 3D U-Nets with separable space-time convolutions and attention modules. The models are trained on a large dataset of videos scraped from the internet as well as individual frames. VDMs can generate short video clips from random noise vectors, text prompts, or single image inputs. A classifier-free guidance technique is used during sampling to improve coherence and alignment with the text prompts. While VDMs produce promising results, limitations include inconsistent object motions and shapes over time. Key contributions of the work include the adaption of diffusion models to video through the proposed model architecture and training procedures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks":

The paper proposes AttnGAN, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture for fine-grained text-to-image generation. AttnGAN consists of two stages: an attentional generative network and a discriminative network. The attentional generative network contains a deep attentional multimodal similarity model and a hierarchical GAN. The deep attentional multimodal similarity model measures the similarity between the text description and the visual features of the generated image. It focuses on relevant words and their corresponding image regions to generate fine-grained images. The hierarchical GAN contains a global GAN and a local GAN. The global GAN focuses on the overall image layout and rough shape while the local GAN pays attention to the details conditioned on the text description. The discriminative network aims to distinguish real images from fake/generated images. AttnGAN generates images with higher resolution and better quality compared to previous text-to-image generation models. Experiments demonstrate AttnGAN's ability to generate fine-grained details from textual descriptions. The attention mechanism provides interpretability and enables controlling the synthesis process.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "Cheer Up, Eeyore! Sentiment Analysis of Winnie the Pooh Characters":

The paper analyzes the sentiment of characters in the Winnie the Pooh stories using natural language processing techniques. The authors collected quotes from each character in the books and annotated them for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. They then trained machine learning models on this dataset to classify the sentiment of new quotes. The models achieved over 80% accuracy, with Eeyore quotes being the easiest to identify as predominantly negative. Analysis of the results shows distinct emotional profiles for each character, with Pooh and Piglet expressing overwhelmingly positive sentiment and Eeyore being the most negative. The models struggled to classify sentiment of ambiguous or context-dependent quotes. The authors suggest their technique could be applied to other literary works to analyze emotional arcs of characters. Overall, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of training ML models to categorize the sentiment of fictional characters based on their quotes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper "Landscape of the Rate Distortion Behavior of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models":

The paper analyzes the rate-distortion behavior of text-to-image diffusion models, specifically DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. It studies how the distortion (measured by FID) between generated and real images varies as a function of the information rate provided by the text prompt. 

The key findings are:
1) Diffusion models exhibit a smooth rate-distortion curve, meaning the distortion gradually decreases as more bits of information are provided in the prompt. 
2) Prompts with higher information rates allow diffusion models to generate more varied, creative, and faithful images. However, prompts with too little or too much information lead to unrealistic, distorted images. 
3) There is an optimal prompt length that balances sufficient information with creativity. Extremely long prompts stifle creativity.
4) Prompt engineering strategies like storytelling are effective at increasing the information rate while using a fixed bit budget. The increased context leads to images that are more faithful to the story.
5) There are still gaps between generated and real image distributions, especially for complex concepts like interactions between multiple entities. Future work should focus on closing these gaps.

In summary, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of how textual information provided to diffusion models affects the visual realism of generated images. It offers insights into prompt design strategies and areas of improvement for text-to-image models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper "Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis":

The paper compares diffusion models and GANs on the task of unconditional image synthesis. Both diffusion models and GANs are powerful generative models that can learn to sample from complex, high-dimensional data distributions like natural images. 

The authors train diffusion models and GANs on five standard image datasets - CIFAR10, STL10, CelebA, LSUN bedrooms, and ImageNet. They compare the models using common quantitative metrics like FID score and qualitative human evaluations. The key finding is that diffusion models significantly outperform GANs on image quality across all datasets, especially on higher-resolution images like LSUN and ImageNet. The authors attribute the superior performance of diffusion models to their continuous sampling process and denoising objectives, in contrast to the discrete sampling and adversarial training of GANs. Overall, the paper provides compelling evidence that diffusion models are currently state-of-the-art for unconditional image synthesis across diverse datasets and image resolutions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper "Dual Diffusion: Bridging VAEs and Diffusion Models":

The paper proposes a new generative modeling approach called Dual Diffusion that combines strengths from variational autoencoders (VAEs) and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). 

Dual Diffusion trains two diffusion models: a forward diffusion model that corrupts the data, and a reverse diffusion model that removes the noise. The forward model serves a similar role to the encoder in a VAE, mapping the data to a latent space. The reverse model acts analogously to the VAE decoder, reconstructing the data from the latents. Dual Diffusion also trains an additional prior network that regularizes the latent space. At test time, sampling is performed by first sampling the prior, then feeding this through the reverse diffusion to generate novel samples. A key benefit of Dual Diffusion is that it does not require any approximate posterior inference like VAEs. The diffusion models provide exact likelihood evaluation. Dual Diffusion also avoids issues like posterior collapse suffered by VAEs. Experiments show Dual Diffusion can generate sharper samples than DDPMs and VAEs alone on image datasets. The framework could enable developing more powerful generative models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Unbounded Generation of Animated 3D Humans from a Single Image using Score-Based Differential Programming":

The paper proposes a novel framework for generating temporally consistent 3D human meshes and textures from a single input image. The key idea is to optimize a 3D human model parameterized by SMPL-X using score-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Specifically, the authors extend the noise conditioning strategy from image generation to the task of 3D human generation. Starting from random noise, they iteratively denoise the noise vector into a 3D human model by querying a pretrained image DDPM as a "world prior". At each iteration, the current 3D parameters are rendered into an image, Gaussian noise is added, and the denoised image from the DDPM together with the original noise constitute the gradient signal to update the 3D human model. This allows leveraging powerful 2D image priors for generating 3D humans with realistic appearance and shape. The resulting animated human models are temporally coherent as they are optimized as a single spacetime volume. Experiments demonstrate photorealistic and temporally consistent 3D human generation from diverse input poses.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper "Text-Guided Controlled Generation and Editing of High-Resolution Videos":

The paper introduces a novel framework that enables high-quality video generation and editing through text-guidance while providing precise user control. The key idea is to use a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as an image prior and extend it to videos through the addition of temporal attention layers. This model can generate text-conditioned videos, while an adapter module allows conditioning on various spatial controls like segmentation maps or poses for controllable generation. For editing, they propose a two-stage approach - generating keyframes with the text-to-image diffusion model, then propagating edits through optical flow warping and blending. A depth-aware blending technique helps resolve disocclusion errors. This pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results for tasks like text-guided video generation, image-to-video translation, and controlled video editing in terms of visual quality and edit flexibility. The modular design also allows new spatial control handles to be easily incorporated.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Control-A-Video: Controllable Video Generation with Spatial Guidance":

The paper proposes Control-A-Video, a framework for controllable video generation guided by spatial signals. The method extends ControlNet, a popular conditional image generation model, to the temporal domain. Specifically, it introduces Video-ControlNet by adding 1D temporal convolutions and a hierarchical cross-frame self-attention mechanism on top of the standard ControlNet architecture. Video-ControlNet is trained end-to-end on a large-scale video dataset with paired spatial guidance signals, such as semantic maps, sketches, and poses. At test time, the model takes as input a sequence of spatial guidance signals and generates a video that complies with the spatial constraints in a temporally consistent manner. The spatial guidance signals allow control over various aspects of the generated video, such as layout, content, and motion. The proposed method combines the benefits of large-scale video diffusion models with the controllability of conditional image generation frameworks.

The key contributions are: (1) extending ControlNet to videos by adding temporal convolutions and attention, (2) training the model end-to-end on videos paired with spatial guidance signals, and (3) enabling controllable video generation using various spatial constraints at test time. The results demonstrate the model's ability to generate high-quality and spatially-consistent videos.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of generating 3D shapes from text prompts. Specifically, it aims to generate complex 3D shapes that accurately match the semantic meaning of text prompts, while also ensuring high visual quality.

Some key points:

- Existing 3D shape generation methods struggle to generate high-quality shapes from just text prompts. This is due to the lack of large 3D datasets with text annotations and difficulties in adapting 2D image generation models to 3D.

- This paper proposes a novel framework called Michelangelo that can generate 3D shapes from text using a diffusion model trained on both text and 2D renderings of 3D shapes. 

- The key idea is to learn a joint text-image-shape embedding space using a transformer encoder, which allows leveraging abundant text-image data to train the shape generation model.

- During training, text prompts and 2D renderings of 3D shapes are encoded to this joint space. The diffusion model is trained to reconstruct 3D shapes from codes in this space.

- At inference time, text prompts are encoded to the joint space and fed to the diffusion model to generate 3D shapes.

- This approach allows generating 3D shapes that accurately reflect the semantic meaning of text prompts at high visual quality by exploiting powerful 2D image priors.

- Experiments show Michelangelo significantly outperforms previous text-to-3D generation methods in terms of shape quality and semantic alignment with text.

In summary, the main contribution is a new framework for high-quality text-to-3D generation by learning joint text-image-shape representations and effectively leveraging abundant text-image data. This alleviates data scarcity issues in 3D and adapts powerful 2D image generation models to 3D.

\section{Spatio-temporal Motion Generation and Editing}
\label{sec:motion}
\Authors{Kfir (confirmed), Gordon, support team}

Motion generation shares similarities and differences from the generation of static content. On one hand, modeling motion requires accounting for temporal dependencies and dynamics over time. On the other hand, motion data is typically more structured and constrained compared to images or 3D shapes. This section will focus on human motion, a domain that has seen significant advances from the use of diffusion models.

\section{Generalization}
\Authors{Ben (confirmed), Bjorn (confirmed), Jon (confirmed)}

\subsection{Task Definition}
- The goal of generalization is to learn models that can synthesize novel \emph{instances} of a category, rather than memorizing individual training examples.
- A model could memorize each training example, but then it would fail to generalize to novel instances.
- Generalization is a prerequisite for creativity and imagination.

\subsection{Approaches}
\paragraph{Implicit generalization}
- Many models exhibit generalization implicitly without explicit pressures. 
- For example, GANs can generalize reasonably thanks to competition and regularization.
- Diffusion models also generalize thanks to their continuous noise schedules.
- But there are ways to more explicitly encourage generalization.

\paragraph{Conditioning}
- Providing the model with a conditioning signal forces it to learn the full distribution p(x|y) rather than just memorize p(x).
- For example, class labels~\cite{radford2015unsupervised} or text prompts~\cite{dosovitskiy2020image}.

\paragraph{Data augmentation} 
- Aggressive data augmentation during training prevents overfitting to the training set.
- Common choices: random crops, flips, color changes, blurs, etc.
- Forces the model to learn invariance to these augmentations.

\paragraph{Architecture biases}
- The inductive biases of CNNs lend themselves well to generalization.
- Their translation equivariance leads to learning spatially invariant features.
- Modern networks augment CNNs with attention, transformers, memory networks, etc.

\paragraph{Disentangled representations}
- Learning representations where single dimensions ("style codes") control semantic attributes improves generalization. 
- Achieved via VAEs~\cite{kingma2013auto}, normalizing flows~\cite{kumar2020regularized}, or adversarial learning~\cite{mathieu2016disentangling}.
- Allows interpolating and modifying attributes in the latent space.

\paragraph{Meta-learning}
- "Learning to learn" techniques like MAML~\cite{finn2017model} train models that can quickly adapt to new tasks with little data.
- Model is optimized to generalize to similar tasks seen during meta-training.

\subsection{Datasets}
- ImageNet~\cite{deng2009imagenet}, CIFAR~\cite{krizhevsky2009learning}, ImageNetV2~\cite{recht2019imagenet} for classification.
- CelebA~\cite{liu2015faceattributes}, FFHQ~\cite{karras2019style} for faces.
- LSUN~\cite{yu15lsun}, Places~\cite{zhou2017places}, SUN~\cite{xiao2010sun} for scenes.   
- ShapeNet~\cite{chang2015shapenet}, ABC~\cite{Koch19ABC}, ModelNet~\cite{wu20153d} for shapes.
- Generalization depends heavily on dataset coverage.

\subsection{Evaluation}
- Train/test split accuracy for classification.
- Precision and recall for generation.
- User studies.
- Robustness benchmarks~\cite{hendrycks2021natural}. 
- Distributional shift tests~\cite{taori2020measuring}.
- Sparse task generalization~\cite{zhai2019large}.

\subsection{Limitations}
- Current models still lack human-level generalization and can fail on novel distributions.
- Reinforcement learning~\cite{cobbe2021training} and classifier guidance~\cite{dhariwal2021diffusion} can improve robustness.
- Generalization depends heavily on the coverage of the training set.
- Quantifying generalization remains an open challenge.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper appears to be addressing the challenge of generating coherent and realistic videos using neural networks. Specifically, it is focusing on improving the temporal consistency of videos generated by conditional video generation models. 

Some key points about the problem and approach:

- Existing video generation models often struggle to maintain temporal consistency, resulting in visual artifacts like objects changing shape/appearance over time. This reduces the realism of generated videos.

- The paper proposes a new model architecture called a spatio-temporal latent diffusion model that is designed to improve temporal consistency. 

- The model builds on latent diffusion models for images by adding convolutions and attention layers that operate over time as well as space. This allows the model to learn video-specific structure.

- The paper trains this model on a large dataset of videos scraped from the internet, without any labels or human annotation. This allows them to leverage the abundance of video data online.

- They demonstrate that their model generates more temporally consistent videos compared to baseline approaches, especially for text-conditional generation where the model has to generate new content that fits the text prompt.

In summary, the key problem is generating realistic and temporally consistent video, and this paper introduces a latent video diffusion model trained on large unlabeled video data that represents the state-of-the-art in improving temporal consistency. The ability to leverage abundant unlabeled video data is a notable strength.

This section discusses methods for novel view synthesis for static scenes without dynamic elements. The synthesis of novel views from captured images is a long-studied problem in computer vision and graphics, with a rich history of image-based rendering techniques like light fields~\cite{levoy1996light} and Lumigraphs~\cite{gortler1996lumigraph}. Recently, coordinated progress in neural representation learning and differentiable rendering have enabled a new class of techniques that learn an implicit neural scene representation from input images and then render novel views through volumetric ray marching~\cite{max1995optical}. These neural rendering techniques excel at novel view extrapolation, handling challenging cases like specular materials, thin structures, and complex occlusion boundaries.

\subsection{Learning scene representations}

Early work on neural scene representations focused on single objects~\cite{sitzmann2019deepvoxels,Lombardi:2019,mescheder2019occupancy,park2019deepsdf,chen2019learning}. These methods represent a scene as either a voxel grid, occupancy field, or signed distance function (SDF), and are trained from many views of an object undergoing known rigid motion. A key limitation of these approaches is that they do not extend well to large scenes with complex occlusion boundaries. 

Neural radiance fields (NeRF)~\cite{Mildenhall_2020_NeRF} overcome this limitation by representing a scene as a continuous volumetric radiance field rather than discrete geometry. The radiance and density at each point in space are predicted by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) conditioned on the 3D location. Volume rendering~\cite{max1995optical} is used to accumulate color and opacity along rays. NeRF learns view-dependent effects and can represent complex geometries like hair and trees. However, the cost of volumetric rendering grows linearly with scene size. Follow-up work has sought to improve the efficiency of NeRF through techniques like hash-based MLPs~\cite{Reiser2021}, sparse voxel octrees~\cite{yu2021plenoctrees}, and log-linear density encoding~\cite{lindell2020autoint}.

While NeRF synthesizes High-quality novel views, a core limitation is that it does not provide an explicit scene representation that could be manipulated or edited. Follow-up work aimed to create hybrid representations that pair neural radiance fields with more structured scene representations. Neural Volumes~\cite{Lombardi_2019_NeuralVolumes} and NeuS~\cite{wang2021neus} embed a deformable mesh within a neural radiance field.  MVP~\cite{Lombardi_2021_MVP} represents scenes as a set of neural radiance fields anchored to reconstructed meshes.  These hybrid representations show promising results but have not yet matched the quality of NeRF.  Concurrently, some work has sought to learn neural fields not just from images, but paired with other supervision like depth~\cite{xian2020space}, segmentation~\cite{niemeyer2020differentiable}, or scene graphs~\cite{ost2021neural}. This additional supervision improves efficiency and enables semantic editing.

A parallel thread of work has revisited classic computer graphics representations like voxels~\cite{Sitzmann2019DVR}, triangle meshes~\cite{Yariv2020MultiviewNN}, and texture-mapped meshes~\cite{OechsleICCV21} through the lens of modern deep learning. These hybrid approaches pair classic graphics primitives with neural networks that provide a learned prior over shape, appearance, and pose. While promising, current results still lag behind the quality of end-to-end learned representations like NeRF.

\subsection{Generalization}

A core limitation of the aforementioned techniques is that they require capturing images with known camera poses for each new scene. To synthesize novel views of new scenes, we need to generalize across objects and environments. Early work on generative neural scene representations focused on objects~\cite{schwarz2020graf}, but current research aims to tackle more complex indoor~\cite{niemeyer2020giraffe} and outdoor~\cite{martinbrualla2020nerf} environments. These methods train an implicit neural scene representation on images from many scenes, so that it can generalize to new environments. 

Current generalization techniques can be roughly categorized as feedforward, meta-learning, and conditioning approaches. Feedforward approaches like pi-GAN~\cite{chan2020piigan}, GRAF~\cite{schwarz2020graf}, and GIRAFFE~\cite{niemeyer2020giraffe} train a single network to map input viewing directions to output radiance. The network overfits to memorize each training scene, so capacity (parameters) must scale with the number of scenes. Meta-learning approaches like Neural Scene Graphs~\cite{ost2021neural} and Scene Representation Networks~\cite{sitzmann2019srns} instead aim to learn an algorithm that can adapt to new scenes based on a few input images. These methods show promising generalization, but current techniques still require fine-tuning on new scenes using iterative optimization.

Most recent work has focused on conditioning approaches, where a scene representation is produced by applying an learned conditioning network to a new input image~\cite{yu2020pixelnerf} or set of images~\cite{martinbrualla2020nerf}. The conditioning network aims to encode information about scene appearance and geometry that enables rendering novel views with a canonical radiance field network. These approaches inherit benefits from foundation models trained on internet-scale image data, while modeling scene-specific geometric detail. Current research is focused on improving the conditioning architectures to enable rendering of more complex scenes.

\par\rule{\columnwidth}{0.5pt} 

Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models extend text-to-image (T2I) models by using a diffusion model to generate a (short) video given only a text prompt, a single image (e.g., with additional conditioning data such as optical flow), or an input video. The last setting, video-to-video translation, is closely related to conventional video editing, and often involves alterations of the input video in the latent space of a pre-trained T2V model.

The first challenge for all T2V models is to model the temporally consistent structure of video without compromising on the quality of the underlying T2I models. Usually, this is achieved by extending T2I U-Net architectures to 3D by introducing separable temporal layers, usually using temporal convolutions and temporal attention mechanisms (see Fig.~\ref{fig:video:spatiotemporalunet}). 

The second challenge for T2V models is to train them. Here, we differentiate between two approaches: (i) methods that train or fine tune a T2V model using a large dataset of videos scraped from the web and (ii) methods that build directly on pre-trained text-to-image models in a zero-shot/one-shot setting, i.e., they do not use any video data to train or refine the model.

\subsection{Video Generation}
\tali{Despite the tremendous progress in \emph{image} diffusion models, and the remarkable breakthroughs in text-to-image generation, expanding this progress to the domain of  \emph{video}  is still in nascent stages, due to two main challenges. \\ \\ First, learning from videos require order of magnitude more data than images, due to the complexity and diversity of our dynamic world. While online videos are abundant, curating high-quality video datasets remain a difficult task that typically involves significant engineering efforts and requires dedicated automatic curation tools. \\ \\
Another substantial challenge arises from the high dimensionality of raw video data, e.g.,  a 2 minutes video taken at 30fps consists of 3600× more pixels than a single frame. This makes the extension of 2D architectures to the temporal domain extremely challenging and computationally expensive. We next discuss how these challenges have been tackled in the context of diffusion models.  }

\paragraph*{Training and Refining Diffusion Models with Large-scale Video Data.}
\tali{I think I prefer Unconditional and Text-Conditioned Video Diffusion Models}


Video Diffusion Models (VDMs)~\cite{ho2022video} introduced the first T2V diffusion model. Imagen Video~\cite{ho2022imagen} introduced a cascaded model that initially models video distribution at low resolution and then applies spatio-temporal interpolation to increase the resolution and time duration. Both VDM and Imagen Video are developed by Google. These T2V models as well as Gen-1~\cite{esser2023structure} by Runway ML are trained jointly on a large corpus of high-quality video and corresponding captions as well as a number of text-image datasets. Make-A-Video~\cite{singer2022make} and Make-a-Video-4D~\cite{Singer2023TextTo4DDS} (see more details in Sec.~\ref{sec:4D_generation}) by Meta AI, Align-your-Latents~\cite{blattmann2023align} by Nvidia, MagicVideo~\cite{zhou2022magicvideo} by ByteDance, and ModelScope~\cite{wang2023modelscope} by Alibaba all fine-tune pre-trained T2I diffusion models on large amounts of unlabeled (i.e., without text captions) or sparsely labeled video data.  AnimateDiff~\cite{guo2023animatediff} follows a similar strategy and discusses personalization strategies of the Base T2I model in depth. Most of these approaches extend existing T2I models using a 3D U-Net architecture~\cite{cciccek20163d} that is factorized over space and time by adding temporal convolution and attention layers. A representative illustration of this architecture is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:video:spatiotemporalunet}.

Align-your-Latents and MagicVideo adopt a latent diffusion strategy for high-resolution and computationally efficient video generation. PVDM~\cite{yu2023video}, Latent Video Diffusion Models~\cite{he2022latent}, and VideoGen \cite{li2023videogen} also propose different variants of latent video diffusion strategies.

Other approaches to video generation include MCVD~\cite{voleti2022MCVD}, which generates videos autoregressively by conditioning new frames on previously generated frames, and VideoFusion~\cite{luo2023videofusion}, which decomposes the noisy latents of the video into the sum of a (static) base noise and a (dynamic) residual noise.

    %\item \cite{khachatryan2023text2video} generate clip from SD without any video finetuning: they extend the self-attention module to operate jointly on several frames (aka extended attention) and perform simple manipulations on the noise latents to encourage consistency.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper titled "Video Diffusion Models" by Chris Donahue et al. is addressing the task of generating high-fidelity, diverse videos from text prompts using diffusion models. Some key points:

- Existing diffusion models have shown impressive results for image generation, but extending them to video generation poses challenges due to the increased dimensionality and complexity of the data distribution. 

- The paper proposes a video diffusion model (VDM) that can generate diverse, temporally coherent videos from text prompts. It extends image diffusion models to the temporal domain using separable spatial and temporal diffusion processes.

- They train the VDM on a large dataset of video-text pairs scraped from the web. The model is trained jointly on full videos and individual frames.

- They introduce classifier-free guidance during sampling to improve sample quality and alignment with the text prompt.

- The paper demonstrates that their proposed VDM can generate high-quality, diverse videos from text prompts that exhibit complex motion and temporal consistency.

- Some limitations include computational cost of generating high-resolution video, lack of explicit modeling of 3D scene geometry, and difficulty controlling aspects like camera motion.

In summary, the key problem addressed is generating coherent, controllable videos using diffusion models, which requires extending architectures and training techniques developed for image generation. The paper makes progress toward video generation by developing a large-scale temporal diffusion model.
