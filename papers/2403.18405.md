# [Leveraging Large Language Models for Relevance Judgments in Legal Case   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Collecting relevance judgments for legal case retrieval is challenging and time-consuming, requiring substantial domain expertise and effort to read lengthy texts.  
- Existing methods rely heavily on extensive high-quality annotated data which is scarce.

Proposed Solution:
- Design an automatic workflow to leverage general large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 to make relevance judgments for legal cases. 
- Break down the annotation process into 4 main steps:
   1) Preliminary analysis by legal experts to provide reasoning demonstrations
   2) Adaptive demo retrieval to find most relevant demonstrations
   3) Fact extraction guided by the demonstrations
   4) Fact annotation assessing relevance based on extracted facts
- Carefully instruct the LLM through each step to activate domain knowledge and align judgments with expert criteria. 
- Address challenges of expertise requirement, lengthy texts, and nuanced sensitivity via the staged prompting design.

Main Contributions:
- First automated method for legal case relevance annotation using general LLMs. 
- Achieve high consistency with expert annotations empirically.
- Generated synthetic dataset can significantly improve legal case retrieval models when used for fine-tuning.
- Each component of the workflow contributes to enhancing annotation quality.
- Minimal expert guidance enables adapting the approach to other legal domains.

In summary, the paper presents a novel automated annotation workflow tailored for legal cases that can reliably generate relevance labels. By leveraging general LLMs and providing guided expert reasoning, it overcomes major challenges faced in legal annotation. The high-quality synthetic data produced can further augment case retrieval models.
