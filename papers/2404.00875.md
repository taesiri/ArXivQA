# [DPA-Net: Structured 3D Abstraction from Sparse Views via Differentiable   Primitive Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Learning structured 3D shape abstractions from only a few RGB images of an object captured from significantly different viewpoints is challenging. 
- Existing methods either require 3D supervision or produce unstructured shape representations that are not editable or interpretable.

Proposed Method:
- Propose a novel differentiable primitive assembly (DPA) framework integrated into a neural radiance field (NeRF) architecture for structured 3D abstraction without 3D supervision. 
- The core idea is to replace the density prediction in NeRF with a learned occupancy field based on an assembling of convex quadric primitives using constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations.
- The CSG assembly parameters are predicted from aggregated image features and optimized via volume rendering losses defined on the input images.

Contributions:
- Introduce differential primitive assembly into NeRF to enable structured 3D abstraction from only a few RGB images without 3D supervision.
- Achieve superior abstraction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets.  
- Obtain editable and interpretable primitive-based 3D abstractions that can serve as structural prompts for shape editing and downstream 3D generation tasks.
- Propose test-time adaptation, silhouette-aware sampling, primitive dropout and overlap loss to further improve abstraction accuracy and compactness.

In summary, the paper presents a novel differentiable framework, DPA-Net, to learn structured and editable 3D abstractions from very sparse RGB image inputs without 3D supervision. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness.
