# [CasSR: Activating Image Power for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Image super-resolution aims to generate high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. Recent diffusion model-based methods leverage powerful pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models but still face challenges in preserving fidelity and avoiding introducing spurious content not in the original image. Crafting suitable text prompts to guide the model is difficult.  

Method:
The paper proposes CasSR, a cascaded diffusion model for super-resolution. It contains two stages. First, an image activation module attenuates degradation of the LR input to generate a reference image closer to the target HR image. This provides more accurate guidance in the next stage. Second, a multiple attention mechanism is introduced to enhance control over the T2I model by utilizing features from both the LR input and reference image.

Contributions:
1) A novel cascaded model that optimizes information extraction from the LR input to minimize impact of degradation on the T2I model.
2) Shows simplicity of enhancing the LR input over complex text prompt design for guiding diffusion models.
3) Introduces a multiple attention architecture for finer control over generation using both LR input and reference image features.

Experiments validate CasSR generates high quality, high fidelity super-resolution results. Both quantitative metrics and visual results on benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness over recent state-of-the-art approaches.
