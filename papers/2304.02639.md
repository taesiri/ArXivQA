# [ENTL: Embodied Navigation Trajectory Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02639)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper seems to be:Can we develop an effective method for learning long sequence representations for embodied navigation that is sample efficient and generalizable to multiple tasks/environments? The key points I gathered are:- They propose a method called Embodied Navigation Trajectory Learner (ENTL) that unifies world modeling, localization, and imitation learning into a single sequence prediction task. - ENTL is trained to make vector-quantized predictions of future states conditioned on current states and actions.- The goal is to develop a generic architecture that enables sharing a spatio-temporal sequence encoder across multiple embodied tasks. - They aim to achieve competitive performance on navigation tasks using significantly less data than other methods.- ENTL can perform auxiliary tasks like localization and future frame prediction as a proxy for world modeling.- A key property is that the model is pre-trained without any explicit reward signal, making it more generalizable.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that their proposed ENTL method can effectively learn reusable sequence representations for embodied navigation in a more sample-efficient and generalizable manner compared to existing approaches. The paper likely presents experiments to validate whether this hypothesis holds true.
