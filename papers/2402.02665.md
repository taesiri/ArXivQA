# [Utility-Based Reinforcement Learning: Unifying Single-objective and   Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) research has mostly focused on single-objective RL (SORL), where the goal is to maximize a scalar reward signal. Recently, multi-objective RL (MORL) has emerged as an important subfield, where the agent seeks to optimize a vector of multiple reward objectives. 

- So far, most transfer of knowledge has been from SORL to MORL, with SORL innovations adapted to handle multiple objectives. This paper argues the reverse could also be beneficial - concepts from MORL could benefit SORL.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a unified "utility-based RL" (UBRL) framework that encompasses both SORL and MORL. The key idea is to explicitly incorporate a utility function that defines the utility derived from reward signals into the RL formulation.

- For SORL problems, this allows multi-policy learning over different possible utility functions, enabling learning of multiple policies optimized for different user-specified priorities and preferences. This facilitates more flexible agents and greater user control.

Key Contributions:

- Formalization of UBRL framework that unifies SORL and MORL paradigms under the notion of an explicit utility function.

- Highlighting the potential benefits of multi-policy learning for SORL problems with uncertain/changing objectives, incorporating risk-awareness, exploring impact of discount rates, etc.

- Discussion of algorithmic considerations with non-linear utility functions in RL, drawing on insights from MORL literature regarding optimizing for average vs per-episode returns.

- Outlining several promising applications of multi-policy utility-based SORL: modeling uncertain business objectives, configurable risk-sensitive policies, understanding impact of discount rates, safe satisficing agents.

In summary, the paper makes a case for wider consideration of insights and techniques from multi-objective RL in improving single-objective RL algorithms and applications through an overarching utility-based perspective.
