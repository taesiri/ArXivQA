# [Predictive Chemistry Augmented with Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04881)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes TextReact, a novel framework that augments predictive chemistry models with relevant text passages retrieved from the literature. The core idea is to leverage textual descriptions of chemical reactions to enhance model predictions on tasks like reaction condition recommendation and retrosynthesis. TextReact has two main components - a SMILES-to-text retriever that identifies relevant texts for a given reaction, and a text-augmented predictor that encodes both the reaction and retrieved texts to make a prediction. The model alignment between text and reactions is enhanced via an auxiliary masked LM objective. Experiments on two chemistry tasks show that by leveraging relevant text, TextReact substantially outperforms state-of-the-art chemistry models operating solely on molecular data. The performance gains are consistent even under a challenging time-based split of the datasets. TextReact also exhibits strong generalization capabilities to novel reactions not seen during training. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of incorporating textual knowledge to improve predictive chemistry models.
