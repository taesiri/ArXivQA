# [Change points detection in crime-related time series: an on-line fuzzy   approach based on a shape space representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of detecting and querying abrupt changes (change points) in time series data, specifically for applications in crime analysis. Detecting changes in crime trends over time is useful for tasks like resource allocation and understanding crime phenomena. However, existing methods for change point detection lack flexibility and intuitiveness. This makes them difficult to use for crime analysts who lack extensive data mining expertise.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new method called Fuzzy Change Points Detection (FCPD) which allows intuitive querying of change points using linguistic terms. FCPD has two main steps:

1. Time Series Segmentation: The time series is segmented into windows at points where the shape changes significantly. This is done dynamically based on analyzing polynomial approximations of the time series, without needing fixed window sizes.

2. Fuzzy Querying of Segments: A fuzzy inference system is used to query segments based on linguistic terms describing geometric properties like "steep increase". The fuzzy system allows flexibility through tunable membership functions and rules.

Key Contributions:

- Intuitive and flexible querying of change points using fuzzy terms 
- Dynamic segmentation tailored to shapes rather than fixed windows
- Meaningful time series representation using polynomial approximations  
- Applicable in an online setting without needing future data
- Validation on both crime and financial time series showing accuracy and low complexity

In summary, the key innovation of FCPD is allowing domain experts with limited data mining expertise, like crime analysts, to understandably detect and analyze changes in time series like crime trends. This is achieved through an interpretable fuzzy system operating on a shape-based time series representation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel method for flexibly detecting and querying change points in time series data by combining a shape space representation, dynamic segmentation, and fuzzy logic inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of a novel method called FCPD (Fuzzy Change Points Detection) for the intuitive and flexible detection and querying of change points in crime-related time series. The key aspects that make this method unique are:

- It uses a meaningful shape space representation of the time series based on polynomial approximations. This allows change points to be described more intuitively through coefficients that estimate properties like average, slope, curvature, etc.

- It performs dynamic segmentation of the time series based on detecting change points, rather than using a fixed window size. This allows segments to better capture the underlying shapes. 

- It allows change points to be queried using linguistic terms and a fuzzy inference system. This enables expressing intuitive queries related to geometric properties of changes, making the method understandable even for non-data mining experts.

- It is an online, iterative method that only relies on past values to detect change points. This makes it suitable for real-time applications like crime trends monitoring. 

- It has low computational complexity related to the polynomial approximation rather than number of observations.

In summary, the main contribution is a flexible, intuitive, and efficient method for detecting and querying change points specifically aimed at supporting tasks like crime analysis.
