# [ThinkBot: Embodied Instruction Following with Thought Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07062)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes ThinkBot, an embodied agent that can effectively follow human instructions to complete household tasks. Unlike prior methods that directly execute the often sparse and incoherent instructions, ThinkBot reasons about the thought chain and underlying goals in the instructions to fill in missing details. Specifically, an instruction completer module leverages large language models to predict intermediate actions and objects that are missing between steps of the original instructions. This results in more complete and coherent instructions. An object localizer module then uses the enhanced instructions along with observed visual scenes to predict locations of objects to interact with. By recovering missing actions and spatial information, ThinkBot is able to successfully complete challenging embodied tasks that require long-horizon reasoning and interaction. Extensive experiments on the ALFRED benchmark demonstrate that ThinkBot substantially improves success rates and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods for embodied instruction following, especially on novel unseen environments. The intuitive instruction reasoning and visio-linguistic grounding abilities enable ThinkBot to generalize effectively to new scenes and tasks.
