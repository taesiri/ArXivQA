# [ThinkBot: Embodied Instruction Following with Thought Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07062)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes ThinkBot, an embodied agent that can effectively follow human instructions to complete household tasks. Unlike prior methods that directly execute the often sparse and incoherent instructions, ThinkBot reasons about the thought chain and underlying goals in the instructions to fill in missing details. Specifically, an instruction completer module leverages large language models to predict intermediate actions and objects that are missing between steps of the original instructions. This results in more complete and coherent instructions. An object localizer module then uses the enhanced instructions along with observed visual scenes to predict locations of objects to interact with. By recovering missing actions and spatial information, ThinkBot is able to successfully complete challenging embodied tasks that require long-horizon reasoning and interaction. Extensive experiments on the ALFRED benchmark demonstrate that ThinkBot substantially improves success rates and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods for embodied instruction following, especially on novel unseen environments. The intuitive instruction reasoning and visio-linguistic grounding abilities enable ThinkBot to generalize effectively to new scenes and tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a ThinkBot agent that reasons about the thought chain underlying sparse instructions to recover missing actions for more coherent task plans, enabling higher success rates in embodied instruction following.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a ThinkBot agent that reasons the thought chain in sparse human instruction to recover missing action descriptions. Specifically:

1) It proposes an instruction completer based on large language models to generate the missing actions with interacted objects in sparse human instruction. This allows coherent instruction generation for complex EIF tasks.

2) It presents a multimodal object localizer to predict the position of objects for agent interaction, by aligning language instruction and visual perception from semantic maps.

3) Extensive experiments on the ALFRED benchmark demonstrate that ThinkBot outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a sizable margin in terms of success rate and efficiency for embodied instruction following.

In summary, the key contribution is using thought chain reasoning in sparse instructions to recover missing actions, in order to successfully complete complex embodied AI tasks with higher efficiency. The instruction completer and object localizer components enable the agent to achieve this.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an instruction completer module to recover missing actions from sparse instructions. What are the key components of the prompt engineering used to enable the language model to accurately predict missing actions? How does incorporating environment state and subgoal information help?

2. The paper utilizes a multimodal transformer-based object localizer to provide spatial guidance. Explain the rationale behind using the semantic map features as queries and instruction features as keys/values. Why is mining inter-object correlations beneficial for localization? 

3. The instruction completer generates structured outputs indicating both the missing action and target object. Discuss the motivation behind this design choice compared to just textual action descriptions. How does this structured output connect to and facilitate the object localization module?

4. What are the limitations of direct action sequence generation using LLMs due to the extremely large search space? How does the paper's approach of high-level plan generation + low-level control mitigate this challenge? Elaborate.  

5. The object localizer is supervised using expert demonstration trajectories. Explain how the ground truth location labels are obtained from the demonstrator trajectories. What are the tradeoffs with this type of weak supervision compared to more manual annotation?

6. Instruction following often requires multi-step inference and planning. Explain how the proposed pipeline attempts to capture long-term dependencies and cross-modal reasoning through components like the instruction completer and object localizer.

7. The experiments show larger gains on a specialized "hard" subset consisting of tasks requiring opening receptacles to find target objects. Analyze why the approach works well in these complex cases compared to prior work. 

8. What types of commonsense knowledge and reasoning seem to be captured by the instruction completer's thought chain predictions? Provide some examples from the paper's results. How might the approach fall short in other types of instruction following?

9. The paper focuses on physical, interactive environments for household tasks. How might the approach apply (or not apply) to instruction following in other domains like software task automation or dialogue systems? Identify any assumptions made.

10. Both the instruction completer and object localizer modules utilize recent advances in foundation models. Discuss the prospects for further improvements as these foundation models continue to evolve in capability. What enhancements may be enabled?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Embodied instruction following (EIF) requires agents to complete human instructions by interacting with objects in complex environments. Existing methods directly use the sparse human instructions to generate action plans, but often fail due to incoherent or missing actions in the instructions. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes ThinkBot, an agent that reasons about the thought chain in human instructions to recover missing action descriptions. This allows the agent to follow more coherent instructions to successfully achieve human goals.

ThinkBot has two main components:
1) An instruction completer based on large language models. It takes the current instruction, visual perception, and completed sub-goals as input. It then predicts missing actions involving interacted objects between consecutive instructions. This reconnects the thought chain to create coherent instructions.

2) A multimodal object localizer. It predicts positions of interacted objects from the recovered instructions and observed semantic maps. This provides spatial guidance so the agent can manipulate the correct objects when following instructions. The localizer uses object correlation mining to enhance localization.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes reasoning of thought chain in instructions to recover missing actions and enable instruction following in complex environments. 
- Presents an instruction completer using prompts and large language models to predict coherent actions between sparse instructions.
- Introduces a multimodal transformer-based object localizer that aligns language and visual perceptions for spatial guidance.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ALFRED benchmark, with higher success rate and efficiency than previous methods.

The key insight is to leverage thought chain reasoning to transform incoherent instructions into coherent plans that agents can successfully follow to achieve complex human goals.
