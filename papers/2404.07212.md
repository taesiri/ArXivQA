# [Hybrid Training of Denoising Networks to Improve the Texture Acutance of   Digital Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Digital cameras apply complex image processing pipelines to develop RAW images into final RGB images. These pipelines impact the camera's ability to preserve textures.
- Standard protocols to evaluate texture preservation rely on the "texture acutance" metric computed on synthesized "dead leaves" images that have statistical properties close to natural images.
- Recent learned image processing methods can be optimized to perform well on such evaluation metrics, without considering overall image quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a mixed training procedure for image denoising CNNs, using both natural and dead leaves images.
- Define a "acutance loss" function based on the texture acutance metric to optimize texture preservation.
- Jointly train with data fidelity losses on natural images (L2, L1) and the acutance loss on dead leaves.

Main Contributions:
- Show that the texture acutance of denoising CNNs can be greatly improved using the mixed training, without impairing performance on natural images.
- Validate for AWGN removal on RGB images with FFDNet, and for RAW image denoising with a U-Net.
- The framework allows optimizing standard texture preservation tests, while maintaining overall image quality.
- Can be extended to improve complete RAW processing pipelines.
- Opens the path for systematically improving the texture rendering of imaging devices.

In summary, the paper proposes a smart training procedure to improve a standard texture evaluation metric for imaging devices, without sacrificing overall image quality. The core idea is to use a perceptual loss tailored for this metric during the training of image restoration CNNs.
