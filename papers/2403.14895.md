# [Stance Reasoner: Zero-Shot Stance Detection on Social Media with   Explicit Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Stance detection aims to identify the stance or opinion expressed in a text towards a given target topic. The paper focuses on the challenging task of zero-shot stance detection, where the model needs to generalize to new and unseen targets during testing. This requires the model to have both background knowledge about new targets as well as general reasoning strategies that can be adapted to new targets. Existing supervised methods fail to generalize well and also lack interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Stance Reasoner, a novel framework for zero-shot stance detection on social media posts. It explicitly reasons over background knowledge to predict the stance towards a given target. Specifically:

- It uses a pre-trained language model (LLaMA) as the source of world knowledge and background information about targets. 

- It employs the chain-of-thought (CoT) in-context learning approach to generate intermediate reasoning steps leading to the stance prediction. 

- The prompt provided to the model includes optimized task description and a diverse set of examples covering different reasoning strategies to enhance generalization.

- Self-consistency is used during inference where multiple predictions are generated for a sample and majority vote is taken to improve robustness.

Main Contributions:

- Stance Reasoner outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including fully supervised methods, on 3 Twitter stance detection datasets, showing better generalization across targets.

- It provides interpretable predictions by generating explicit reasoning chains explaining the inferences made to arrive at the predicted stance.

- Analysis shows reasoning quality depends on diversity of strategies covered in prompt examples.

- Model confidence score allows identification of annotation errors and ambiguous samples.

In summary, the paper presents an effective and interpretable approach for zero-shot stance detection on social media by utilizing explicit reasoning and in-context learning.
