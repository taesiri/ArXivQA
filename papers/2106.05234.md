# Do Transformers Really Perform Bad for Graph Representation?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can Transformer architectures perform well for graph representation learning, despite not having achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards compared to mainstream GNN variants?The authors aim to address this question by presenting Graphormer, a Transformer-based model for graph representation learning. Their key insight is that it is necessary to effectively encode the structural information of graphs into Transformer models to make them work well. To summarize, the main hypothesis is that with proper incorporation of graph structural information, Transformer architectures can perform excellent graph representation learning, contrary to prior results suggesting Transformers may not be suitable for this task. The authors support this via the proposed Graphormer model and experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on graph learning benchmarks.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Graphormer, a Transformer-based architecture for graph representation learning, which incorporates novel ways of encoding structural information like node centrality, spatial relations, and edge features to allow the model to effectively represent graphs and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph prediction tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper proposes Graphormer, a new architecture for graph representation learning that is based on the Transformer. Most prior work has focused on developing graph neural network (GNN) architectures like GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, etc. Applying the Transformer architecture to graphs is still relatively new. - The key contribution of this paper is incorporating structural information of graphs into the Transformer model through centrality encoding, spatial encoding, and a specialized edge encoding method. This is different from prior Transformer-based methods like GT that use positional encodings or focus on limiting self-attention to neighbors.- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of Graphormer on a range of graph representation benchmarks including the recent large-scale OGB-LSC challenge. This shows the potential of Graphormer versus prior GNN methods.- The authors also provide an analysis of the expressive power of Graphormer, proving that it can represent several popular GNN architectures like GCN, GAT, etc. This theoretical analysis is lacking in most prior work.- Compared to concurrent Transformer-based methods like GROVER, Graphormer achieves better performance without requiring massive pretraining datasets and resources. This makes it more practical.- Limitations of this work compared to some other research include the quadratic complexity of Transformer attention, which may limit scalability. The encodings used also may not leverage domain knowledge as heavily as possible.In summary, Graphormer pushes state-of-the-art in graph representation learning using Transformers, demonstrates solid empirical performance, and provides useful theoretical analysis. It makes contributions over prior Transformer and GNN methods but still has some limitations to address in future work. The results clearly show the potential of Transformers in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more efficient versions of Graphormer to address the quadratic complexity issue of the standard Transformer architecture. The authors mention that recent advances in efficient Transformers could potentially be applied to Graphormer as well.- Exploring different choices for the centrality measure and spatial relation function phi(v_i, v_j) used in Graphormer's encodings. The authors used degree centrality and shortest path distance as general purpose choices, but performance could likely be improved by using domain-specific measures.- Adapting Graphormer for node representation tasks, which will require developing good graph sampling strategies. The authors mention node representation as an important direction for future work.- Pre-training even larger Graphormer models on massive unlabeled graph datasets, similar to what has been done with language models like GPT-3. The pre-training gave significant gains on downstream tasks, suggesting value in scaling up further.- Applying Graphormer to additional graph learning tasks beyond the ones studied in the paper, such as in social networks, finance, temporal prediction, etc. Evaluating the generalizability of Graphormer across domains.- Analyzing Graphormer theoretically to better understand its properties and expressiveness compared to other graph neural network architectures. - Exploring architectural variants of Graphormer, e.g. replacing/augmenting self-attention with other mechanisms while maintaining the encoders.Overall, the authors propose Graphormer as a new promising architecture for graph representation learning and suggest many interesting directions to build on this work across domains, tasks, theory, and systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Graphormer, a novel graph neural network based on the Transformer architecture. The key insight is that effectively encoding structural information of graphs like node centrality and spatial relations is critical for Transformers to work well on graph data.

Centrality encoding assigns each node learnable embeddings based on its degree to capture node importance. Spatial encoding models the distance between node pairs via bias terms in the attention module. Edge encoding aggregates edge features along shortest paths to inform the attention probabilities. Experiments on quantum chemistry, molecular property prediction, and solubility tasks demonstrate Graphormer's state-of-the-art performance. Notably, Graphormer significantly outperforms previous Transformers and GNNs on the large-scale OGB graph benchmark. Theoretical analysis shows Graphormer can represent popular GNN architectures like GCN and GIN as special cases. In summary, the paper presents an effective way to make Transformers work very well on graphs via carefully encoding structural information.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Graphormer, a graph neural network model based on the Transformer architecture. Graphormer incorporates graph structural information into the Transformer through three main techniques: centrality encoding, spatial encoding, and edge encoding. The centrality encoding adds node degree information to the input features. The spatial encoding uses shortest path distances between nodes as bias terms in the attention module. The edge encoding averages edge features along shortest paths and adds them as attention biases. Experiments show that Graphormer achieves state-of-the-art results on quantum chemistry, molecular property prediction, and solubility tasks. It outperforms Graph Transformer and established graph neural networks like GCN, GAT, and GIN. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the proposed encodings. Theoretical analysis shows Graphormer subsumes popular GNN architectures like GCN and GIN. Overall, the paper shows Transformers can effectively model graphs with proper incorporation of graph structure. The proposed techniques provide simple yet effective ways to leverage graph information in Transformers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Graphormer, a graph neural network model built upon the Transformer architecture. The key insight is that in order to apply Transformers effectively to graph data, it is important to incorporate the structural information of graphs into the model. To achieve this, the authors propose three main techniques: 1) Centrality Encoding, which captures node importance using degree centrality; 2) Spatial Encoding, which encodes the shortest path distance between node pairs as a bias in the attention module; and 3) Edge Encoding, where edge features are incorporated by computing an average of dot products between edge features and learnable embeddings along the shortest path. By using these techniques to encode graph structure, Graphormer is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph representation learning benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of the Transformer architecture for modeling graph data when combined with effective structural encodings.
