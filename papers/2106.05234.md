# [Do Transformers Really Perform Bad for Graph Representation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05234)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can Transformer architectures perform well for graph representation learning, despite not having achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards compared to mainstream GNN variants?

The authors aim to address this question by presenting Graphormer, a Transformer-based model for graph representation learning. Their key insight is that it is necessary to effectively encode the structural information of graphs into Transformer models to make them work well. 

To summarize, the main hypothesis is that with proper incorporation of graph structural information, Transformer architectures can perform excellent graph representation learning, contrary to prior results suggesting Transformers may not be suitable for this task. The authors support this via the proposed Graphormer model and experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on graph learning benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing Graphormer, a Transformer model adapted for graph representation learning. The key modifications include centrality encoding, spatial encoding, and edge encoding to incorporate graph structure information into the Transformer architecture. 

2. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of Graphormer on a variety of graph learning benchmark datasets, including the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge for quantum chemistry regression.

3. Providing theoretical analysis on the expressive power of Graphormer, showing it can cover several popular GNN models as special cases. The strong capacity enables the great empirical performance.

4. Conducting ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed encodings for capturing graph structure. 

In summary, the key contribution is developing Graphormer by carefully designing structural encodings to adapt the powerful Transformer architecture for graph representation learning. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate Graphormer's effectiveness. The work provides new state-of-the-art results across various graph learning tasks and sheds light on how to effectively utilize Transformer architectures for modeling graph data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Graphormer, a Transformer-based architecture for graph representation learning, which incorporates novel ways of encoding structural information like node centrality, spatial relations, and edge features to allow the model to effectively represent graphs and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph prediction tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes Graphormer, a new architecture for graph representation learning that is based on the Transformer. Most prior work has focused on developing graph neural network (GNN) architectures like GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, etc. Applying the Transformer architecture to graphs is still relatively new. 

- The key contribution of this paper is incorporating structural information of graphs into the Transformer model through centrality encoding, spatial encoding, and a specialized edge encoding method. This is different from prior Transformer-based methods like GT that use positional encodings or focus on limiting self-attention to neighbors.

- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of Graphormer on a range of graph representation benchmarks including the recent large-scale OGB-LSC challenge. This shows the potential of Graphormer versus prior GNN methods.

- The authors also provide an analysis of the expressive power of Graphormer, proving that it can represent several popular GNN architectures like GCN, GAT, etc. This theoretical analysis is lacking in most prior work.

- Compared to concurrent Transformer-based methods like GROVER, Graphormer achieves better performance without requiring massive pretraining datasets and resources. This makes it more practical.

- Limitations of this work compared to some other research include the quadratic complexity of Transformer attention, which may limit scalability. The encodings used also may not leverage domain knowledge as heavily as possible.

In summary, Graphormer pushes state-of-the-art in graph representation learning using Transformers, demonstrates solid empirical performance, and provides useful theoretical analysis. It makes contributions over prior Transformer and GNN methods but still has some limitations to address in future work. The results clearly show the potential of Transformers in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more efficient versions of Graphormer to address the quadratic complexity issue of the standard Transformer architecture. The authors mention that recent advances in efficient Transformers could potentially be applied to Graphormer as well.

- Exploring different choices for the centrality measure and spatial relation function phi(v_i, v_j) used in Graphormer's encodings. The authors used degree centrality and shortest path distance as general purpose choices, but performance could likely be improved by using domain-specific measures.

- Adapting Graphormer for node representation tasks, which will require developing good graph sampling strategies. The authors mention node representation as an important direction for future work.

- Pre-training even larger Graphormer models on massive unlabeled graph datasets, similar to what has been done with language models like GPT-3. The pre-training gave significant gains on downstream tasks, suggesting value in scaling up further.

- Applying Graphormer to additional graph learning tasks beyond the ones studied in the paper, such as in social networks, finance, temporal prediction, etc. Evaluating the generalizability of Graphormer across domains.

- Analyzing Graphormer theoretically to better understand its properties and expressiveness compared to other graph neural network architectures. 

- Exploring architectural variants of Graphormer, e.g. replacing/augmenting self-attention with other mechanisms while maintaining the encoders.

Overall, the authors propose Graphormer as a new promising architecture for graph representation learning and suggest many interesting directions to build on this work across domains, tasks, theory, and systems.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Graphormer, a graph neural network architecture based on the Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on graph representation learning benchmarks. The key insight is incorporating structural information about the graph into the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer. 

To encode node centrality, Graphormer uses degree-based centrality encoding, assigning learnable embeddings to nodes based on their indegree and outdegree. This helps the model capture node importance. 

For encoding spatial relations, Graphormer assigns learnable biases to node pairs based on the distance of their shortest path. This allows attending globally based on graph structure. An edge encoding method is also proposed to leverage edge features via an attention bias.

Graphormer demonstrates strong performance on the PCQM4M-LSC quantum chemistry regression challenge, outperforming GNN methods by over 10% in terms of relative error. It also achieves state-of-the-art on popular benchmarks like OGB and ZINC with careful hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.

Theoretically, Graphormer is shown to be more expressive than common GNNs, with explicit constructions to recover popular aggregation and combine operations in its self-attention. The work provides a strong case for the potential of Transformer architectures for graph representation learning.
