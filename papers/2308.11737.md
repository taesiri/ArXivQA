## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the results and analysis in the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Developing more advanced architectural designs and training strategies specifically for 3D animal pose estimation across species. The results show that existing methods designed for humans or specific animals do not generalize well. New methods can explore things like better leveraging synthetic data, incorporating domain adaptation, designing animal-specific losses, etc.

- Expanding the Animal3D dataset to include more animal species, images, and diversity in terms of poses, backgrounds, viewpoints, etc. This can further push progress on this challenging task and help develop more robust models.

- Exploring the multi-task capabilities of Animal3D, by developing models that can jointly perform pose estimation, segmentation, classification etc. on this diverse animal dataset.

- Investigating how advancements on this dataset can transfer to improving wildlife monitoring, conservation, biomechanics and other downstream applications with real-world impact.

- Studying the performance on individual animal species in more depth to identify which are more challenging to model. Targeted data collection or model design for difficult species could help.

- Developing better evaluation metrics to assess generalization across diverse animal species, rather than just aggregate performance.

In summary, the key directions are around model architecture design, leveraging synthetic data, expanding the diversity and scale of the real dataset, multi-task learning, and developing better evaluation protocols to measure generalization across species. Advances in these areas can significantly push the state-of-the-art in 3D animal pose estimation.

To address these issues, the authors introduce Animal3D, a new dataset covering 40 mammal species with manually annotated 2D keypoints, segmentation masks, and 3D SMAL model parameters. They benchmark different pose estimation models on Animal3D in three settings: supervised learning, synthetic data pre-training, and human pose model fine-tuning. 

The results demonstrate remaining challenges in 3D animal pose estimation across species, despite advances in human pose estimation. The paper also shows that pre-training on synthetic data can improve results on Animal3D. Overall, the paper aims to introduce a diverse animal pose dataset to enable future research on more generalizable animal pose estimation models.
