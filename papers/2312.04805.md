# [Development and Assessment of Autonomous Vehicles in Both Fully   Automated and Mixed Traffic Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04805)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a multi-stage approach for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicles (AVs), focusing on driving performance in both fully automated traffic conditions and in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. First, a single AV is created using deep reinforcement learning and shown to reach, and at times exceed, human driving capabilities on a simulated test track. The research then examines cooperative driving between multiple interconnected AVs, introducing a "sharing and caring" vehicle-to-vehicle communication concept that significantly enhances coordination and safety. Bidirectional communication allowed AVs to achieve 100% safe driving in simulations. However, mixed traffic experiments involving both AVs and human participants highlighted challenges, with only 60-88% exhibiting successful cooperation. While connected AVs enable safer driving, the research concludes that additional infrastructure and training may be necessary for mixed traffic environments before fully automated vehicles can be reliably integrated on public roads alongside unpredictable human drivers. Overall, it provides valuable insights into designing and transitioning towards autonomous transportation systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a multi-stage approach for developing connected autonomous vehicles, starting with a single AV trained with deep reinforcement learning to match human driving performance, then scaling up to multiple interconnected AVs and examining their cooperative potential, with a focus on comparing fully automated traffic scenarios versus mixed traffic environments involving both AVs and human-driven vehicles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions involve three key aspects:

1. It focuses on the development of a single autonomous vehicle (AV) that closely emulates human driving capabilities. 

2. It scales up from a solitary AV to multiple interconnected AVs, exploring different communication networks among them. This examines the influence of connectivity among AVs and contrasts fully automated traffic environments with mixed traffic environments, where AVs and human drivers coexist.

3. The simulation work is conducted in a Unity-based urban environment with different test scenarios, incorporating human-in-the-loop in some experiments to provide nuanced insights. The tests assess the performance of a single AV, followed by evaluations of interconnected AVs, and additionally investigate mixed traffic scenarios with human-driven vehicles.

In summary, the key contributions are: developing a performant single AV, exploring cooperative autonomous driving among multiple AVs, and contrasting fully automated vs mixed traffic scenarios involving both AVs and human drivers. The work provides empirical insights, especially regarding AV and human-driven vehicle interactions.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are advancing rapidly, but questions remain about how AVs will interact with each other and with human drivers, especially as AVs become more prevalent. Ensuring cooperative interactions between AVs and between AVs and humans is critical.

- Key research gaps exist in: examining implications when AVs are not interconnected, addressing mixed traffic scenarios which are an inevitable transition to fully automated traffic, and using realistic physics simulators to avoid gaps between simulation and real world.

Proposed Solution
- The paper presents a multi-stage approach for developing connected autonomous vehicles, starting with a single AV and progressing to multiple interconnected AVs.

- Unity game engine is used to create a realistic 3D urban driving environment for testing. Deep reinforcement learning trains the AVs.

- Four key stages:
   1) Develop single AV to match human driving performance
   2) Introduce second AV without connectivity  
   3) Add unidirectional V2V communication
   4) Enable bidirectional V2V with "caring" reward concept
   
- Human-in-the-loop experiments conducted:
   - Assess single AV vs human drivers
   - Examine all AVs vs mixed traffic with AVs and human drivers
   
Key Contributions
- Single AV matched or exceeded human driving performance

- Interconnected AVs with bidirectional V2V and "caring" rewards achieved cooperative, crash-free driving

- Mixed traffic experiments showed humans often prioritize personal performance over cooperation. But AV adopted a conservative approach.

- Fully automated AVs achieved far higher safety rates (90-100%) compared to mixed traffic scenarios. 

- Advocates enhanced research into safely incorporating AVs on public roads alongside human drivers.
