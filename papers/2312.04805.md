# [Development and Assessment of Autonomous Vehicles in Both Fully   Automated and Mixed Traffic Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04805)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a multi-stage approach for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicles (AVs), focusing on driving performance in both fully automated traffic conditions and in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. First, a single AV is created using deep reinforcement learning and shown to reach, and at times exceed, human driving capabilities on a simulated test track. The research then examines cooperative driving between multiple interconnected AVs, introducing a "sharing and caring" vehicle-to-vehicle communication concept that significantly enhances coordination and safety. Bidirectional communication allowed AVs to achieve 100% safe driving in simulations. However, mixed traffic experiments involving both AVs and human participants highlighted challenges, with only 60-88% exhibiting successful cooperation. While connected AVs enable safer driving, the research concludes that additional infrastructure and training may be necessary for mixed traffic environments before fully automated vehicles can be reliably integrated on public roads alongside unpredictable human drivers. Overall, it provides valuable insights into designing and transitioning towards autonomous transportation systems.
