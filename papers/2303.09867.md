# [DiffusionRet: Generative Text-Video Retrieval with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: How can we develop an effective text-video retrieval model using a generative approach based on diffusion models?The key hypothesis appears to be:Modeling the text-video retrieval task as a process of generating the joint distribution of text and video queries/candidates using a diffusion model can lead to better performance compared to existing discriminative retrieval models.In particular, the paper argues that:- Existing discriminative models maximize the conditional likelihood p(candidates|query) but do not model the underlying data distribution p(query), making them less generalizable.- Generative models that capture the joint probability p(candidates, query) allow projecting data into the correct latent space based on semantic information.- Diffusion models are promising for this task due to their ability to gradually uncover correlations between modalities and generate joint distributions. To test this hypothesis, the paper proposes DiffusionRet, which uses a diffusion model to generate the joint text-video distribution and combines generative and discriminative optimization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks aim to demonstrate the advantages over existing discriminative models, especially for out-of-domain generalization.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively apply generative diffusion models for text-video retrieval to overcome limitations of current discriminative approaches. The hypothesis is that modeling joint distributions will improve performance and generalization.
