# [DiffusionRet: Generative Text-Video Retrieval with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: 

How can we develop an effective text-video retrieval model using a generative approach based on diffusion models?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Modeling the text-video retrieval task as a process of generating the joint distribution of text and video queries/candidates using a diffusion model can lead to better performance compared to existing discriminative retrieval models.

In particular, the paper argues that:

- Existing discriminative models maximize the conditional likelihood p(candidates|query) but do not model the underlying data distribution p(query), making them less generalizable.

- Generative models that capture the joint probability p(candidates, query) allow projecting data into the correct latent space based on semantic information.

- Diffusion models are promising for this task due to their ability to gradually uncover correlations between modalities and generate joint distributions. 

To test this hypothesis, the paper proposes DiffusionRet, which uses a diffusion model to generate the joint text-video distribution and combines generative and discriminative optimization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks aim to demonstrate the advantages over existing discriminative models, especially for out-of-domain generalization.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively apply generative diffusion models for text-video retrieval to overcome limitations of current discriminative approaches. The hypothesis is that modeling joint distributions will improve performance and generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes DiffusionRet, a novel text-video retrieval framework based on diffusion models. To my knowledge, this is the first work to tackle text-video retrieval from a generative perspective using diffusion models. 

2. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for text-video retrieval, including MSRVTT, LSMDC, MSVD, ActivityNet Captions and DiDeMo.

3. It demonstrates the generalization ability and transferrability of the proposed generative approach to out-of-domain text-video retrieval, where the model is trained on one dataset but tested on a different unseen dataset. This is a challenging setting that discriminative methods struggle with.

4. It provides insights into combining the strengths of both generative and discriminative modeling for text-video retrieval. The framework optimizes both a generator via generative losses and a feature extractor via contrastive losses.

5. It adapts diffusion models, which have shown great success in image/text/audio generation, to cross-modal retrieval for the first time. The iterative refinement enabled by diffusion models allows progressively enhancing the retrieval.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel generative framework for text-video retrieval using diffusion models. Both the in-domain and out-of-domain results demonstrate the advantages of modeling text-video retrieval from a generative perspective.
