# [Distributed Robust Learning based Formation Control of Mobile Robots   based on Bioinspired Neural Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15716)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of distributed formation control of multiple mobile robots operating under disturbances with completely unknown dynamics. Specific issues tackled include:

- Lack of scalability and robustness in centralized formation control methods as the number of robots increases. 

- Velocity constraints and "speed jump" issue where demanding torque becomes very large due to initial tracking errors. This makes the control input unrealistic.

- Dealing with unknown and unmodeled robot dynamics and external disturbances during formation control.

Proposed Solution:

The paper proposes a novel distributed formation control method with the following key components:

1) A distributed estimator using cascade and variable structure design to estimate the leader's positional and velocity states without needing derivative information. This reduces computational complexity.

2) A bioinspired neural dynamic based kinematic controller that addresses velocity constraints and smooths control input using the bounding properties and filtering capability of the neural dynamics.

3) A learning-based robust dynamic controller that actively estimates robot dynamic parameters online and provides robustness against disturbances.

Main Contributions:

The main contributions highlighted in the paper are:

- The distributed formation control method that eliminates the need for derivative information and addresses real-world challenges like velocity constraints, unknown dynamics and disturbances.

- Rigorous stability analysis of the overall formation protocol using Lyapunov theory.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the method through multiple simulation studies showing: (i) smooth velocity control without speed jump, (ii) convergence of distributed estimator (iii) parameter estimation under disturbances, and (iv) reduced tracking error.

In summary, the paper proposes a practical distributed formation control solution for mobile robots and provides convincing validation of its advantages. Key facets are the bioinspired controller design and integrated learning-based robust control.
