# [AutoGuide: Automated Generation and Selection of State-Aware Guidelines   for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for empowering AI agents to address complex sequential decision-making tasks. However, LLMs have limited understanding of the world due to the confined knowledge in their training data. This poses significant challenges when deploying LLM-based agents, especially in target domains where LLMs lack sufficient prior knowledge to act effectively. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a novel framework called AutoGuide that aims to bridge the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs by extracting and leveraging the implicit knowledge embedded in offline experiences. Specifically, AutoGuide automatically generates a comprehensive set of state-aware guidelines from the offline data. Each guideline is expressed in concise natural language statements following a conditional structure that clearly describes the state in which the guideline is applicable. 

During test time, AutoGuide summarizes the current trajectory into a state description and retrieves the corresponding state-aware guidelines to augment the prompt for the LLM agent. By explicitly conditioning the applicability of each guideline based on the state, AutoGuide provides the agent with the most relevant guidelines to aid its decision-making process.

Main Contributions:
1) A principled method to generate state-aware guidelines from offline experiences based on two key modules - the state summarization module and the guideline extraction module.

2) Comprehensive evaluation across multiple interactive decision-making benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, WebArena) highlighting AutoGuide's capability to effectively extract and exploit knowledge to enhance LLM agent's performance.

3) Extensive analyses examining the impact of only having successful/unsuccessful trajectories in the offline data and the ablation studies quantifying the contribution of different components within AutoGuide.

The results demonstrate that by providing pertinent state-aware guidance, AutoGuide significantly outperforms strong LLM-based baselines in challenging decision-making domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes AutoGuide, a framework to automatically generate state-aware guidance from offline data to enhance large language model agents' decision-making in sequential tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It develops a principled method called \texttt{\Ours} for automatically extracting a comprehensive set of state-aware guidelines from offline experiences. Specifically, it has two key modules - a state summarization module to generate a description of a given state, and a guideline extraction module to extract a desired guideline corresponding to that state. 

2) It provides a comprehensive evaluation of \texttt{\Ours} on diverse sequential decision-making benchmarks, including realistic web environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility to be incorporated into existing LLM-based methods.

3) It provides several important analysis perspectives on \texttt{\Ours}, such as the significance of determining the applicability of each guideline based on generated states. It also shows that \texttt{\Ours} can extract valuable knowledge even when the offline experiences contain only successful or only unsuccessful trajectories.

In summary, the main contribution is a principled framework called \texttt{\Ours} that generates state-aware guidelines from offline experiences to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language model agents. Both the method and the comprehensive experiments highlight its usefulness.

The paper introduces a framework called "AutoGuide" that aims to extract knowledge from offline experiences in order to enhance the decision-making capabilities of LLMs in downstream tasks and domains. The key idea is to automatically generate a set of "state-aware guidelines" from offline data that provide conditional knowledge related to certain agent states. These guidelines are then incorporated into prompts during test time to improve the performance of LLM-based agents. The method is evaluated on several interactive benchmark domains including embodied AI (ALFWorld), web shopping (WebShop), and web navigation (WebArena).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does AutoGuide generate state descriptions from trajectories in the offline dataset? What prompt engineering strategies are used to enable an LLM to produce useful state summaries?

2. What are the key differences between the state summarization module and the guideline extraction module in AutoGuide? What is the intuition behind having separate modules for these two tasks?  

3. The guidelines extracted by AutoGuide are conditional on states. Why is it important that the guidelines explicitly describe the states where they should apply instead of providing general advice? 

4. During test time, AutoGuide summarizes the current trajectory into a state and retrieves the relevant guidelines. Why is the state matching step important here rather than just using the current trajectory to find applicable guidelines?

5. When there are multiple guidelines associated with a matched state, AutoGuide employs guideline selection to pick the most relevant ones. What factors does this selection take into account when judging relevance?

6. The experiments show that AutoGuide outperforms baselines by a large margin. What are the key strengths of AutoGuide over methods like ReAct and ExpeL that contribute to its superior performance?

7. The analysis explores how AutoGuide can be adapted when the offline dataset only contains successful or only unsuccessful trajectories. What modifications need to be made in these two cases for extracting useful guidelines?  

8. How suitable is AutoGuide for complex environments like WebArena compared to simpler domains? Why does the approach achieve more significant gains in WebArena over the baselines?

9. Can AutoGuide cope with changes in the environment dynamics between the offline data collection and deployment? What strategies can be adopted to make the approach more robust?

10. The related works section discusses agent capabilities like reasoning and tool use. Can the AutoGuide approach be extended to transfer knowledge related to such skills instead of just focusing on action-oriented guidelines?
