# [Edge Private Graph Neural Networks with Singular Value Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10995)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Edge Private Graph Neural Networks with Singular Value Perturbation":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to privacy attacks where an adversary can query the GNN model to infer private information about the graph used to train the model, such as sensitive edges representing social or financial relationships.
- Existing defense methods based on differential privacy (DP) perturb the entire adjacency matrix or a compact representation, altering the graph structure substantially and reducing model utility/accuracy.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Eclipse, a new DP-based training methodology for GNNs that leverages the low-rank structure of real-world graph adjacency matrices.
- Eclipse decomposes the adjacency matrix into low-rank and sparse components via singular value decomposition (SVD). Only the top few singular values capture most information about the graph.
- Eclipse trains the GNN on the low-rank approximation, which preserves primary graph topology while removing secondary edges, providing empirical privacy. 
- Eclipse adds DP noise only to the top singular values, protecting privacy with less perturbation compared to existing methods.
- Eclipse works as a plug-in to existing GNN architectures without modifying model architecture.

Main Contributions:
- Formal privacy analysis showing Eclipse guarantees edge-level DP. Noise is only added to low-rank singular values instead of the entire adjacency matrix.
- Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrating Eclipse achieves significantly better privacy-utility tradeoff than prior DP-based methods, especially under high privacy constraints. Eclipse improves GNN accuracy by up to 46% for a given privacy budget.
- Analysis of Eclipse's resilience to privacy attacks like LPA and LINKTELLER. Eclipse provides stronger protection compared to baselines, lowering attack AUC by up to 5% for the same model accuracy.
- Analysis and insights into Eclipse's protection on nodes with different degree distribution. Low-rank approximation in Eclipse causes more changes in degree for low-degree nodes, providing them stronger privacy.

In summary, the key innovation in Eclipse is exploiting low-rank structure to apply DP noise in lower dimensions for better utility, while still protecting edge privacy. Eclipse advances state-of-the-art in private GNN training.
