# [Unsupervised Generation of Pseudo Normal PET from MRI with Diffusion   Model for Epileptic Focus Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately localizing epileptic foci in the brain is critical for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy patients. 
- FDG PET imaging can help identify abnormal metabolic areas indicating epileptic foci, but its analysis requires comparison to a normal control group which is often unavailable.  
- Existing methods like conditional GANs require paired MRI-PET training data which may not be accessible.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate unsupervised deep learning methods like CycleGAN and adversarial diffusion model SynDiff to translate MRI to pseudo normal PET images for personalized controls.
- SynDiff employs adversarial training and diffusion modeling for high fidelity PET image generation from unpaired MRI data.
- Generated pseudo normal PET images are then compared to patient's real PET to extract hypometabolic regions indicating potential epileptic foci.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated feasibility of unpaired MR-to-PET translation using SynDiff and CycleGAN for epileptic focus localization without real normal controls.  
- Showed that SynDiff outperforms CycleGAN in generating more accurate and higher quality pseudo normal PET images.
- Pseudo normal PET from SynDiff achieved higher detection rate and localization accuracy of epileptic foci compared to CycleGAN.
- Proposed workflow offers a promising solution for assisting identification of epileptic foci when high quality control data is unavailable.

In summary, the paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning approach using adversarial diffusion models to translate MRI images to pseudo normal PET images for use as personalized controls in localizing epileptic foci without requiring real normal data. The results demonstrate feasibility and potential of this method.
