# [Incentivized Exploration of Non-Stationary Stochastic Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper studies incentivized exploration for multi-armed bandits (MAB) with non-stationary (changing over time) reward distributions. 

- In traditional MAB, the decision maker aims to balance exploration and exploitation to minimize regret. However, in many real-world scenarios, the principal (decision maker) and the agents (who take actions) have misaligned interests - agents behave myopically to maximize immediate rewards while the principal wants to identify the optimal long term strategy.

- Providing monetary incentives can motivate agents to explore more. But the incentives can also introduce bias and drift in the reward feedback from agents. Prior works studied incentive schemes under stationary settings. This paper addresses the open challenge of effective exploration incentives despite non-stationary rewards and drifted feedback.

Key Contributions
- The paper considers two non-stationary MAB settings: (1) abruptly changing, and (2) continuously changing environments. 

- For abruptly changing environments, algorithms based on Discounted UCB and Sliding Window UCB are proposed along with compensation scheme. Sublinear bounds on expected regret and compensation are proved.

- For continuously changing environments, a restarting approach is proposed where a bandit algorithm is reset after fixed intervals. Sublinear regret and compensation bounds are shown for UCB1, $\epsilon$-greedy and Thompson Sampling.

- Empirical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of regret and compensation for the proposed schemes against varying degrees of non-stationarity.

Outcome
- The paper provides the first known incentivized exploration schemes for non-stationary MABs and proves sublinear regret and compensation guarantees despite changes in reward distributions and drifted feedback.

- The findings can enable effective recommendation systems, search engines, clinical trials etc. where both user interests and system parameters evolve over time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies incentivized exploration for the multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationary reward distributions, proposing algorithms for abruptly-changing and continuously-changing environments that achieve sublinear regret and compensation over time, effectively incentivizing exploration despite nonstationarity and biased/drifted feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper studies the problem of incentivized exploration for multi-armed bandits (MAB) with non-stationary (changing over time) reward distributions. The key contributions are:

1) It proposes incentivized exploration algorithms for two different non-stationary MAB settings: abruptly-changing environments where rewards change abruptly at certain breakpoints, and continuously-changing environments where rewards change smoothly over time. 

2) It analytically shows that the proposed algorithms achieve sublinear regret (difference between the benchmark optimal performance and the algorithm's performance) and sublinear compensation (payments made to incentivize exploration) over time for both abruptly-changing and continuously-changing settings.

3) It demonstrates through numerical experiments that the proposed algorithms outperform standard MAB algorithms without incentives and effectively balance exploration and exploitation despite non-stationarity and biased/drifted feedback from the agents.

In summary, the key contribution is developing the first incentivized exploration algorithms for non-stationary MABs and providing performance guarantees in terms of sublinear regret and compensation over time.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this research include:

- Multi-armed bandits (MAB): A classic sequential decision making model involving choosing between multiple arms/actions with unknown reward distributions to balance exploration and exploitation.

- Non-stationary bandits: A variant of MABs where the reward distributions change over time, making the problem more difficult. Two models are considered - abruptly changing and continuously changing environments. 

- Incentivized exploration: Framework where a principal provides compensation to agents for exploring suboptimal arms, not just exploiting the greedy choice. Goal is to minimize regret and compensation costs.

- Regret bounds: Performance metric measuring difference in total rewards gained by algorithm compared to always playing optimal arm. Sublinear regret over time horizon T is desirable.

- Reward drift: Biased (higher) rewards provided by agents when receiving compensation, modelled by a drift function. Can negatively impact balancing exploration/exploitation.

- Algorithms: DUCB and SWUCB for abruptly changing case; Restarting technique with UCB1, ε-greedy or Thompson Sampling for continuous case.

So in summary, main focus is designing incentivized bandit algorithms for non-stationary environments that can effectively balance exploration and exploitation and achieve sublinear theoretical regret and compensation bounds over time.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper considers two different non-stationary bandit environments - abruptly changing and continuously changing. What are the key differences in the underlying dynamics of these two environments? How do the proposed algorithms account for these differences?

2. Theorem 1 provides a regret bound for using Algorithm 3 (incentivized exploration framework) with the DUCB algorithm. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this theorem. What is the intuition behind the choice of the discount factor γ?

3. How does using a sliding window approach in SWUCB help deal with abrupt changes compared to DUCB? Explain why SWUCB has a lower regret bound than DUCB in Theorem 2.

4. For the continuously changing environment, explain why simply using a standard MAB algorithm without restarting (as done in Algorithm 4) will not work well. What is the intuition behind determining the batch size σ?

5. Assumptions 1 and 2 restrict the manner in which rewards can vary across time in the continuously changing environment. Discuss the motivation behind these assumptions and how they impact the regret analysis.  

6. In the proof of Theorem 5, the regret is decomposed into two components J1 and J2. Explain what these components represent and how bounding them leads to the overall regret result.

7. Compare the compensation bounds achieved by the proposed algorithms for the two environments (Theorems 3 and 4). Why is the dependence on the number of breakpoints βT much worse for the abruptly changing environment?

8. The paper assumes the reward drift function is Lipschitz continuous. Discuss how this assumption is exploited in the regret analyses for both environments. How would the results change if this assumption did not hold?

9. Aside from UCB1, ε-greedy and Thompson sampling, discuss some other bandit algorithms that could be used by the principal for recommending arms in the continuously changing environment. Would the results still hold?

10. A key limitation of this work is the sublinear dependence of regret on the number of breakpoints βT. What modifications could be made to the proposed approach to potentially improve this dependence?
