# [WebGLM: Towards An Efficient Web-Enhanced Question Answering System with   Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07906)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to construct an efficient web-enhanced question answering system based on large language models that can understand human preferences and have comparable quality to state-of-the-art systems like WebGPT?The key points related to this research question are:- The paper aims to build a practical web-enhanced QA system called WebGLM based on the 10-billion parameter General Language Model (GLM-10B). - It seeks to identify limitations of existing systems like WebGPT in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness and real-world deployment. - The paper proposes new strategies and designs for the retriever, generator, and scorer components to improve accuracy while being more efficient than WebGPT.- It introduces systematic criteria for evaluating web-enhanced QA systems through multi-dimensional human evaluation.- The goal is for WebGLM to have comparable quality to WebGPT, even with a smaller model size, while being more efficient and cost-effective. - Extensive experiments demonstrate WebGLM's capabilities and provide insights into future improvements.In summary, the central hypothesis is that an efficient high-quality web-enhanced QA system can be constructed through innovations in retrieval, generation, scoring and evaluation, as showcased by WebGLM. The paper presents solutions and experiments to validate this hypothesis.
