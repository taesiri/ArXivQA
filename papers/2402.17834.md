# [Stable LM 2 1.6B Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but most large proprietary models lack transparency around training data and procedures. This poses challenges for reproducing and auditing them.

- There is a need for more modest-sized but still highly performant open LLM models that the community can easily inspect, reproduce, and build upon.

Method
- The authors train Stable LM 2, an open 1.6 billion parameter LLM decoder model. 

- The complete training data mix is provided, consisting of around 2 trillion tokens from public multilingual datasets like C4, Pile, Starcoder etc. 

- A new hybrid cosine-square root learning rate scheduler is proposed that allows infinite training steps.

- After pre-training, the model is further fine-tuned on instruction datasets and via direct human preference learning.

Results
- Stable LM 2 achieves state-of-the-art results among open source models under 2B parameters on the HuggingFace leaderboard.

- It demonstrates strong performance on zero/few-shot benchmarks as well as conversational evaluations like the MT-Bench benchmark.

- Additional multilingual capabilities in 7 languages are shown.

- Quantized versions are provided to enable efficient deployment. Throughput numbers on consumer hardware are benchmarked.

Impact  
- This work helps promote transparency and reproducibility in foundation model development.

- The release of Stable LM 2 1.6B helps democratize access to performant LLMs for researchers with limited compute budgets.

In summary, the paper introduces Stable LM 2 - an open, reproducible 1.6B parameter multilingual model setting new SOTA standards among open LLMs with extensive benchmarking, model analysis and recommendations for future work.
