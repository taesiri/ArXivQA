# [A Study of Acquisition Functions for Medical Imaging Deep Active   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15721)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores using active learning for melanoma detection from dermoscopic images. Active learning aims to achieve good model performance with small labeled training data by iteratively selecting the most informative samples to label from a pool of unlabeled data. The key questions the paper tries to answer are: (1) Is model uncertainty beneficial for melanoma detection?; (2) Is it better to query the most or least uncertain samples?; (3) Which acquisition function works best for melanoma detection?; (4) What is the effect of acquired sample size on performance?

Methodology: 
The paper compares 3 acquisition functions on the ISIC 2016 skin image dataset - Maximum Entropy, Mean Standard Deviation (MeanSTD) and BALD (Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement). These aim to select uncertain samples. Bayesian CNNs are used with these acquisition functions. Starting with 100 labeled samples, at each active learning round, the top 100 most informative unlabeled samples are obtained using the acquisition function to augment the training set. Multiple active learning rounds are performed to compare performance.

Contributions:
1) Uncertainty is shown to be useful for melanoma detection - Bayesian CNNs with uncertainty outperform standard CNNs.
2) Querying most uncertain samples performs better than least uncertain.
3) BALD acquisition function works best on average, confirming claims in an existing paper. However, Maximum Entropy is shown to be more robust. 
4) Analyses revealed all methods perform poorly on positive (minority) cancer samples, indicating exploitation of class imbalance. 
5) Effect of acquired sample size is evaluated - performance is similar across sizes, showing difficulties in small data settings.

Future work involves evaluating on larger skin cancer datasets, and exploring acquisition functions that handle class imbalance better. Code is open-sourced.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores using active learning with uncertainty-based acquisition functions like BALD for melanoma detection on the ISIC dataset, finding that while BALD performs the best on average, all methods struggle to accurately classify the minority positive class, indicating they exploit dataset imbalance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

An empirical evaluation and comparison of different acquisition functions (BALD, MeanSTD, MaxEntropy) for active learning on the task of melanoma detection using the ISIC 2016 skin image dataset. The key results and contributions include:

- Showing that incorporating model uncertainty is beneficial for the melanoma detection task compared to a non-Bayesian CNN baseline. 

- Confirming that querying the most uncertain samples leads to better performance compared to least uncertain for the acquisition functions.

- Demonstrating that BALD performs the best on average as an acquisition function, but MaxEntropy has comparable performance and is more robust/flexible.

- Analyzing the effect of acquired pool size on model performance, showing performance peaks around the default acquisition size of 100.

- Identifying an issue with the acquisition functions exploiting class imbalance and performing poorly on the minority positive (cancer) class. 

So in summary, the main contribution is an empirical evaluation of uncertainty-based active learning for medical imaging showing the promise but also limitations in the context of class imbalance. The paper helps advance understanding of how to effectively apply active learning to medical datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores Bayesian convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for active learning on medical images. How does placing prior probability distributions over the model parameters make these Bayesian CNNs different than regular CNNs? What are the key advantages of this approach?

2. The paper evaluates several acquisition functions like BALD, MeanSTD, and MaxEntropy. Can you explain intuitively what each of these acquisition functions tries to optimize for? What kind of unlabeled samples would each function tend to pick?

3. BALD tries to maximize the mutual information between predictions and model posterior. What does "mutual information" mean conceptually and how does maximizing it help improve model performance in active learning? 

4. The results show that overall BALD performs the best as an acquisition function. However, MaxEntropy also shows competitive performance. What underlying reasons could explain the good performance of MaxEntropy despite it being based on a seemingly opposite principle to BALD?

5. The paper hypothesizes that the stability of BALD may be because it avoids selecting noisy points with large aleatoric uncertainty. What is the difference between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty and why might points with high aleatoric uncertainty be detrimental?

6. All acquisition functions seem to perform worse at correctly classifying the minority positive (cancerous) samples. What limitations does this reveal about these uncertainty-based sampling techniques and how could the approach be made more robust to class imbalance?

7. How exactly does the Monte-Carlo dropout technique allow the model to capture epistemic uncertainty? What role does the dropout probability hyperparameter play here?

8. How does the weight decay regularization used in the paper help prevent overfitting during active learning? What is the meaning and effect of the $p$ and $l^2$ terms? 

9. For computational efficiency, only the top-k most informative points are selected in each AL round. What could be some disadvantages of selecting a smaller vs. larger value of k? What tradeoffs are involved?

10. What kinds of model capacity enhancements could help overcome the underfitting issues faced after the first active learning round? How can the model complexity be systematically increased?
