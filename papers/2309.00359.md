# [Large Content And Behavior Models To Understand, Simulate, And Optimize   Content And Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00359)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can large language models (LLMs) be improved to better predict and optimize communication for desired receiver behavior (i.e. solve the "effectiveness problem" outlined by Shannon)?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Including "behavior tokens" that encode information about receiver behavior (likes, shares, purchases, etc.) in the training data of LLMs will improve their ability to understand, simulate, and optimize content for desired receiver reactions.

In particular, the authors hypothesize that training a large multimodal model called an LCBM (Large Content Behavior Model) on behavior tokens, in addition to textual and visual content, will enable capabilities like:

- Behavior simulation: Predicting receiver behavior given content 

- Content simulation: Generating content given desired receiver behavior

- Content understanding: Understanding meaning and topics of content 

- Behavior understanding: Explaining and reasoning about observed receiver behavior

- Behavior domain adaptation: Generalizing to new types of behaviors

The central hypothesis is that adding behavior tokens during training will teach the LLM to jointly represent and reason about content and behavior, improving performance on this suite of capabilities related to the "effectiveness problem". The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the idea of Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs) - large language models trained on both content tokens and behavior tokens to model both content and behavior in the same space. 

2. Showing capabilities of LCBMs on various tasks:
- Behavior simulation (predicting behavior given content)
- Content simulation (predicting content given behavior)  
- Behavior understanding (explaining observed behavior)
- Content understanding (classifying topics, emotions, etc.)
- Behavior domain adaptation (generalizing to new behaviors)

3. Introducing a new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) containing communicator, message, channel, receiver, and behavior data to enable training and evaluation of LCBMs.

4. Demonstrating improved performance of LCBMs compared to standard LLMs on behavior simulation, content simulation and behavior understanding tasks, while retaining performance on content understanding. LCBMs also showed behavior domain adaptation capabilities.

5. Proposing the idea of converting both content and behavior into a text format and using instruction tuning to teach both modalities to LLMs in an end-to-end fashion.

In summary, the key idea is to include receiver behavior tokens during LLM pretraining to make them learn associations between content and behavior. This is shown to improve their capabilities related to modeling, predicting and explaining human behavior.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes training large language models on both content and associated human behavior data to enable them to better simulate, optimize, and understand the relationship between content and behavior.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on large language models:

- Focus on modeling content and behavior jointly: This paper introduces the idea of integrating "behavior tokens" like shares, likes, clicks, purchases, etc into the training of large language models. Most prior work has focused only on modeling the content, not the associated human behaviors/responses. 

- New capabilities from joint modeling: By training on both content and behavior, the authors show the model gains new capabilities like behavior simulation, content optimization, behavior understanding, etc. This demonstrates potential benefits of joint modeling that go beyond just predicting behaviors.

- New dataset released: The authors collect and release a "Content Behavior Corpus" derived from YouTube data, containing both content and associated viewer behaviors. This provides a valuable new resource for future research in this area.

- Connects to communication theory: The paper frames the problem as related to longstanding ideas in communication theory about encoding/decoding meaning and influencing audience response. Making this connection to communication research helps motivate the technical approach.

- Compares favorably to state-of-the-art: The proposed LCBM model shows better performance on behavior modeling tasks compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, despite being much smaller. This suggests joint training is more effective than just scaling up content-only models.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel perspective on integrating content and behavior modeling in LLMs, supported by new datasets and promising results. The ideas connect to broader communication theory and demonstrate potential benefits over standard content-focused LLMs. This helps advance research towards models that better capture the full context of human communication.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing better techniques for integrating behavior tokens into language model training. The authors mention that simply including behavior tokens in the training data is a first step, but more advanced methods may allow models to learn from behavior tokens more effectively.

- Exploring different model architectures and self-supervised objectives for learning from behavior data. The authors use a standard transformer language model architecture and training approach. Trying different architectures like memory augmented networks or objectives like contrastive learning may improve behavior modeling.

- Expanding the diversity and scale of behavior modeling datasets. The authors mention their Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) as an initial dataset for behavior modeling research. Creating larger and more diverse datasets could help drive further progress.

- Testing behavior modeling capabilities on a wider range of downstream tasks. The authors evaluate on a limited set of tasks. Evaluating on more tasks related to content optimization, recommendation, personalization etc. could better characterize model capabilities.

- Combining behavior modeling with other modalities like vision and audio. This work focused on language-only behavior modeling. Multimodal behavior modeling may reveal new insights into how different modalities interact.

- Studying social effects and networked behavior data. The current work models individual behavior, but extending to model social network effects could be impactful.

- Exploring interpretations and explanations of model behavior predictions. Generating human-interpretable explanations for behavior predictions could build trust and provide insights.

In summary, the authors propose this work as a first step toward integrated content and behavior modeling. But they suggest many promising directions for developing more powerful and nuanced behavior models in the future.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs) to model both content and human behavior in the language space. The authors argue that while large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show impressive generalization capabilities across a variety of natural language tasks, they are unable to effectively model and predict human behavior in response to content, which is key to optimizing communication. This is because most LLM training corpora have stripped out "behavior tokens" like shares, likes, clicks, etc. that indicate receiver response. The authors introduce a new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) containing both content and corresponding receiver behavior. They then train LCBMs on this data using behavior instruction tuning to predict behavior from content and vice versa. Experiments show LCBMs outperform LLMs on behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation while retaining strong content understanding abilities. LCBMs demonstrate few-shot generalization on new behavior types. The authors argue modeling both content and behavior in one multimodal model enables applications like content recommendation, customer journey optimization, and A/B testing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes training Large Language Models (LLMs) on both content and behavior tokens, calling the resulting models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs). The authors argue that while LLMs have made progress on understanding content (Shannon's semantic level), they have not been trained to understand human behavior and communication effectiveness (Shannon's effectiveness level). By training LLMs on additional "behavior tokens" like shares, likes, and purchases along with content, LCBMs can better simulate, understand, and optimize for desired human behaviors and communication outcomes. 

The authors demonstrate LCBM capabilities on several tasks using two datasets - YouTube videos and Adobe marketing emails. Results show LCBMs outperform LLMs on behavior simulation, content simulation given behavior, and behavior understanding tasks. LCBMs also exhibit "behavior domain adaptation", generalizing from one behavior type to another. While LCBMs sometimes underperform larger LLMs on pure content understanding, combining behavior and content training seems to provide complementary information that improves their overall generalization. To spur more research, the authors release a new Content Behavior Corpus containing communicator, message, and receiver behavior data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes training Large Language Models (LLMs) on both content tokens and behavior tokens in order to model the effectiveness of communication, i.e. predicting and optimizing content to elicit desired receiver behavior. The authors posit that typical LLM training corpora contain only content like text, images, audio, and video, while metadata about receiver behavior like clicks, shares, and purchases is stripped out as noise. By reintroducing these behavior tokens along with content tokens during training, the resulting Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs) gain capabilities like behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation. The method converts both visual content using encoders like EVA-CLIP and behavior metrics like replay rates and like/view ratios into text instructions. It then fine-tunes a large pre-trained LLM like Vicuna end-to-end using these behavior instructions to predict behavior from content and vice versa. Experiments on YouTube and email datasets demonstrate LCBMs' effectiveness on various content and behavior tasks compared to content-only LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of modeling and predicting human behavior and the effect of content on behavior. Specifically, it focuses on Shannon's "effectiveness problem" in communication - how to optimally design and transmit messages to achieve desired effects on the receiver. 

The key questions it aims to tackle are:

- How can we build AI systems that can understand, simulate and optimize for content and human behavior? 

- How can we integrate behavior modeling capabilities into large language models (LLMs) to make them more effective at communication tasks?

- Can incorporating "behavior tokens" along with content into LLM training enable new capabilities like behavior simulation, content optimization for desired behaviors, behavior understanding, and cross-domain generalization?

To summarize, the central goal is to develop large multimodal models that can jointly represent and reason about both content and associated human behaviors, towards more effectively achieving goals in communication. This requires bringing in real-world behavioral data into model training.

Some key contributions are:

- Proposing Large Content-Behavior Models (LCBMs) that are trained on behavior tokens to acquire new capabilities beyond just content understanding.

- Introducing behavior instruction tuning methods to teach LLMs the new behavior modality.

- Releasing a new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) dataset linking content to behaviors.

- Demonstrating LCBM capabilities on tasks like behavior simulation, content optimization, behavior understanding and cross-domain generalization.

- Comparing LCBMs to state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 and showing competitive or better performance on behavior modeling tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces methods to model content and behavior jointly in LLMs to make progress on the long-standing effectiveness problem in communication. The results demonstrate promising capabilities on this challenging task.
