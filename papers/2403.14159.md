# [Robust Locomotion via Zero-order Stochastic Nonlinear Model Predictive   Control with Guard Saltation Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Model-based control methods like model predictive control (MPC) for legged robots struggle with uncertainties and inaccuracies in contact information, such as estimated terrain height. These errors can lead to failures like a swinging foot missing ground contact, causing falls. In contrast, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods can capture uncertainties during training. The paper explores how model-based control can achieve robustness against contact uncertainties.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a stochastic/robust nonlinear MPC (NMPC) method that incorporates contact uncertainties using:

1) Guard saltation matrix: Captures how state uncertainties propagate through discrete mode transitions (e.g. foot contact events). Handles multi-contact scenarios.

2) A priori covariance update: Uses guard saltation matrix to predict how contact uncertainties affect future state covariance.

3) A posteriori covariance update: Additional update inspired by output-feedback MPC and EKF to prevent covariance overestimation.

4) Efficient zero-order NMPC algorithm: Enables real-time implementation, with automatic calculation of state feedback gains.  

The method forecasts state covariance over the prediction horizon and tightens constraints to ensure satisfaction even with disturbances. Chance constraints are introduced for some constraints.

Main Contributions:

- Novel covariance propagation method for stochastic/robust NMPC using guard saltation matrix and EKF-like updates
- Efficient algorithm implementation using zero-order NMPC with automatic feedback gains 
- Application to full-centroidal MPC formulation
- Demonstrated performance benefits over other MPC variants in randomized simulations 
- Hardware experiments showing real-time implementation enables robust perceptive locomotion on uneven terrain

The method enhances robustness to contact uncertainties through constraint tightening based on online covariance prediction. Limitations remain in preventing falls on highly uneven terrain. Future work includes contact re-planning under uncertainty.
