# [Continual Learning in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02718)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop methods for continual learning that can learn online from non-stationary data streams without catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge or tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates a regularization-based approach called "Memory Aware Synapses" (MAS) that computes importance weights for neural network parameters online and penalizes changes to important parameters when learning new tasks or data. The key ideas are:

- To estimate importance weights for neural network parameters based on the sensitivity of the learned function output to changes in those parameters, allowing computation on unlabeled data

- To accumulate importance weights online using a cumulative moving average as new data is encountered 

- To use the accumulated importance weights as a regularizer when optimizing the loss on new data, penalizing changes to parameters deemed important for previous data/tasks

The paper evaluates MAS on supervised image classification tasks learned sequentially, showing it can reduce catastrophic forgetting compared to other continual learning methods. A key benefit highlighted is the ability of MAS to estimate importance weights adaptively from unlabeled test data, allowing the method to specialize to specific test conditions.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that computing and accumulating importance weights for network parameters online, and using these to regularize learning on new data, can enable effective continual learning without catastrophic interference as the data distribution shifts over time. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed MAS approach can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of the paper "Importance Weight Regularization for Online Continual Learning" is developing a method for online continual learning that can learn continuously from streaming data without separate tasks or explicit task boundaries. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Extending the Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) importance weight regularization method to work in an online continual learning setting, where data comes sequentially and the distribution may be gradually shifting. 

2. Developing protocols to determine when to update the importance weights, which data to use for the update, and how to accumulate importance weights across updates. This allows MAS to work online without explicitly defined tasks.

3. Introducing a small "hard sample" buffer that stores difficult examples to help stabilize online training and provide better samples for importance weight estimation.

4. Evaluating the online continual learning approach on face recognition from TV shows and robot collision avoidance. Results show the method helps accumulate knowledge over time and adapt to distribution shifts, outperforming online baselines.

5. Demonstrating that importance weight regularization is useful not just for avoiding catastrophic forgetting across tasks, but also for stabilizing online learning within a single environment.

In summary, the key novelty is developing an online variant of MAS that can handle streaming non-i.i.d. data without separate tasks, and showing its benefits for online continual learning in two applications. The method provides a way to apply importance weight regularization in an online setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for lifelong learning in neural networks that computes importance weights for parameters based on the sensitivity of the output function to changes in the parameters, allowing the model to determine what previous knowledge can be forgotten when learning new tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an approach for continual learning of neural networks without task boundaries or prior assumptions on the data stream. It compares favorably to other research in the field in the following ways:

- Most prior continual learning methods assume a task incremental setting, where tasks are learned sequentially with clear task boundaries and i.i.d. data within each task. This paper tackles the more realistic and challenging scenario of online continual learning without task boundaries.

- The paper formulates replay buffer sample selection as a constraint reduction problem based on the constrained optimization view of continual learning. This is a novel way to select representative samples for the replay buffer in an online fashion. 

- The proposed methods for sample selection, both the IQP-based approach and the greedy approximation, do not require task boundary information. They are shown to be robust to imbalanced data streams, outperforming reservoir sampling.

- Experiments on multiple benchmarks (disjoint MNIST, permuted MNIST, disjoint CIFAR-10) demonstrate that the proposed techniques work well even without knowledge of task boundaries and compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods that do assume task boundaries.

- The approach does not store task-specific information or require a task oracle, making it more generally applicable to online continual learning settings.

Overall, this work pushes the boundaries of continual learning closer to real-world scenarios without strict assumptions. The formulation of replay sample selection as constraint reduction and the proposed selection techniques are novel contributions applicable to online continual learning. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing it can learn continually without prior knowledge of tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper discusses several potential future research directions for continual lifelong learning:

- Developing methods that can learn effectively from limited data. Most current continual learning methods require large amounts of data per task, but humans can learn new concepts from few examples. Developing algorithms that can learn continually from limited data is an important direction.

- Developing methods that can learn inter-task relationships and transfer knowledge between tasks. Current methods tend to learn tasks independently, but being able to identify and leverage relationships between tasks (e.g. seeing the similarities between learning two different languages) could improve learning efficiency.

- Developing systems that integrate memory, processing, and representation learning within the same framework. Biological learning systems tightly couple memory, information processing, and representation learning, but most AI systems treat these components separately. Integrated systems could work more effectively.

- Moving beyond incremental task learning scenarios to more open-ended, unstructured lifelong learning settings. Most current continual learning research uses specific incremental task benchmarks, but less structured continual learning scenarios are needed to move towards general AI.

- Developing continual reinforcement learning methods. Most existing continual learning research focuses on supervised learning, but continual reinforcement learning remains a major challenge. Developing methods that can learn continually in an online, goal-driven way is important.

- Studying social interaction for continual learning. Human learning is deeply social, but current continual learning methods do not incorporate social learning. Studying how networked agents that learn collaboratively and teach each other could benefit continual learning.

- Developing theory and metrics for continual learning. Current empirical approaches lack formal measures of learning efficiency and theories of optimal continual learning. Developing theory can guide progress.

So in summary, key future directions include handling limited data, transfer learning, integrated systems, less structured benchmarks, reinforcement learning settings, social interaction, and formal theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for continual learning of neural networks called Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). Continual learning aims to learn a sequence of tasks using the same model without forgetting previous tasks. MAS estimates an importance weight for each parameter in the neural network based on the sensitivity of the output function to changes in that parameter. It does this by accumulating the magnitude of gradients of the function output with respect to each parameter over observed data points. When learning a new task, changes to parameters with high importance weights are penalized, preventing important knowledge related to previous tasks from being overwritten. MAS allows computing importance weights in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled data, enabling adaptation to user-specific settings. Experiments on image classification tasks show MAS reduces forgetting compared to prior methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. A key advantage is the ability to adapt which knowledge to preserve or forget based on frequently encountered unlabeled test data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for continual learning called Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). Continual learning involves training machine learning models incrementally on new tasks without forgetting previous tasks. Most prior methods either regularize model parameters or replay old data samples to prevent catastrophic forgetting. MAS takes a different approach by estimating an "importance weight" for each parameter based on the sensitivity of the predicted output to changes in that parameter. These importance weights are computed in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled data, allowing the model to adaptively determine what previous knowledge is important to preserve for the test data distribution. 

MAS was evaluated on image classification tasks learned sequentially. It achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to prior continual learning methods like EWC, SI, and LwF. Key benefits are: 1) It can compute importance weights on any unlabeled data, not just old training data. 2) It simplifies computations by looking at function sensitivity rather than loss sensitivity. 3) It obtains fewer forgetting on previous tasks. 4) It achieves better knowledge transfer to new tasks in the sequence. A connection to Hebbian learning is also shown through a local variant. Overall, MAS provides an elegant way for neural networks to automatically identify important knowledge to preserve during continual learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Memory Aware Synapses: Learning What (Not) to Forget" by Aljundi et al.:

The paper proposes a method for continual learning that estimates an importance weight for each parameter in a neural network. The importance weights approximate the sensitivity of the learned function's output to changes in each parameter. After training on an initial task, importance weights are computed by accumulating the gradients of the squared L2 norm of the network's output with respect to each parameter, over a set of data points. When training on a new task, changes to parameters with high importance weights are penalized, so that the network preserves its ability to perform well on the previous task. Importance weights are updated after each task using available training or test data. This allows the method to determine which parts of the model are important to remember and which parts can be changed to optimize performance on the new task. The continual learning process is stabilized by restricting changes only to less important parameters.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Gradient based Sample Selection for Online Continual Learning" is addressing the problem of how to select a representative and diverse set of samples from a continuous stream of data in an online continual learning setting. 

Some key points:

- In online continual learning, the model is trained on a never-ending stream of data with changing distribution, without task boundaries or i.i.d. assumption. 

- Regularization-based methods like MAS can suffer from gradual forgetting in this setting as no historical samples are revisited. 

- Replay-based methods that store and revisit samples from the past can help overcome this forgetting. But how to select which samples to store is a key question.

- The paper formulates the sample selection as a constraint reduction problem - selecting a subset of samples that best represent the constraints imposed by the full history.

- They show this is equivalent to maximizing diversity of the selected samples, using the gradient directions as features.

- They propose a greedy selection method that is efficient for large sample selection.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing principled methods for selecting a diverse and representative subset of historical samples to store and replay, in order to overcome forgetting in online continual learning where the full history cannot be stored.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Continual learning - The paper focuses on continual or lifelong learning, which involves learning consecutive tasks incrementally over time from non-stationary data distributions.

- Task incremental learning - The standard continual learning setup where tasks are provided sequentially, with task boundaries known. Data for the current task is available during training.

- Task-free learning - A more challenging continual learning setting without explicit task boundaries or identities. The data distribution changes gradually over time.

- Task rehearsal - A technique to replay or rehearse data from previous tasks while training on a new task, in order to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

- Constrained optimization - Formulating continual learning as optimizing the loss on new data while constraining the losses on data from previous tasks.

- Gradient projection - Projecting the gradients while training on new data to be in the feasible region defined by gradients on previous data.

- Task-aware methods - Continual learning techniques that assume knowledge of task boundaries during training and/or inference.

- Replay buffer - A fixed memory to store data points from previous tasks to be replayed during training.

- Sample selection - Strategies to select the most useful samples for the replay buffer, to maximize diversity.

- Constraint selection - Formulating replay sample selection as choosing constraints that best approximate the original feasible region.

So in summary, key concepts are continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, task incremental vs task-free settings, rehearsal techniques, and methods to select constraints/samples for a replay buffer.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose a new continual learning method called Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) that computes importance weights for neural network parameters in an unsupervised, online manner. Unlike prior methods that compute importance based on the loss, MAS looks at the sensitivity of the learned function's output to changes in each parameter. This allows importance to be computed on any available data, enabling adaptation to specific test conditions. A local variant of MAS is related to Hebbian learning, strengthening connections between concurrently active neurons. Experiments on object recognition and fact learning tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
