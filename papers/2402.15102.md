# [Trajectory-wise Iterative Reinforcement Learning Framework for   Auto-bidding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Auto-bidding tools use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize bidding policies. However, current RL policies are trained in simulation, leading to poor performance when deployed online.
- Directly training policies online via iterative offline RL faces challenges due to ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the conservatism principle of offline RL algorithms.

Proposed Solution: 
Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE)
- Exploration: Use parameter space noise (PSN) to induce exploratory behaviors and collect datasets with more high-return trajectories. PSN leads to more consistent and better exploration compared to action space noise.  
- Exploitation: Propose robust trajectory weighting to focus offline RL training on high-return trajectories in the dataset. This alleviates the conservatism problem in offline RL.

Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS):
- Ensures safety of online exploration by adaptively selecting between exploratory and safe actions based on past rewards.
- Provides theoretical safety guarantees without limiting high-quality exploration behaviors.

Key Contributions:
- Identify performance bottleneck in iterative offline RL for auto-bidding stemming from ineffective exploration and exploitation.
- Propose TEE for efficient trajectory-wise exploration using PSN and exploitation via robust trajectory weighting.
- Design SEAS algorithm to enable safe exploration while preserving data quality.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of proposed techniques through extensive simulated experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba platform.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in making iterative offline RL work effectively for auto-bidding by tackling exploration, exploitation and safety challenges. The ideas can potentially extend to other online policy learning domains as well.
