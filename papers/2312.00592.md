# [Tracking Object Positions in Reinforcement Learning: A Metric for   Keypoint Detection (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00592)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a metric to quantify how well spatial autoencoders (SAEs) extract 2D positional information of objects from images into keypoints for use in downstream reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The metric matches keypoints to ground truth object positions over trajectories via assignment and accounts for consistent offsets by a fitted affine transformation. It then computes a tracking error and capability over multiple SAE training runs. The paper demonstrates the metric on common SAE architectures, finding large performance differences, with the KeyNet architecture combined with proposed modifications (trainable standard deviation, velocity loss, background bias) achieving near perfect tracking capability. The paper further shows that SAEs with higher tracking capability lead to better sample efficiency and asymptotic performance on an RL robotic manipulation task. Thus the lightweight SAE evaluation metric indicates downstream RL performance. Overall, this paper delivers an effective method to judge if and how precisely SAEs extract spatial features, enables troubleshooting and architecture improvements, and reduces compute for finding suitable SAEs before launching expensive RL training.
