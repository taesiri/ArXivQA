# [Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it compares different RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Expert Iteration (EI), and Return-Conditioned RL (RCRL) on mathematical reasoning tasks. The goal is to understand how these algorithms perform in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency when fine-tuning LLMs.

Methods:
The paper frames mathematical reasoning as a Markov Decision Process. Different rewards schemes are tested including sparse, dense, and learned rewards from outcome-based reward models. Experiments are done on 7B and 13B parameter Llamas, initialized both from scratch and from supervised fine-tuned checkpoints. Performance is evaluated using metrics like maj@1, maj@96, rerank@96, and pass@96 accuracy.

Key Findings:
- EI performs the best overall, achieving top accuracy across metrics and competitive sample efficiency to PPO. 
- Neither algorithm benefits much from extra guidance like outcome-based rewards or dense rewards.
- In contrast to continued supervised training, RL training improves both maj@1 and pass@96 simultaneously.
- Sample complexity for convergence is surprisingly low even without supervised pretraining, requiring only ~60K samples for both EI and PPO.
- Larger models generate more diverse solutions during RL fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensive comparison of RL algorithms for improving LLM reasoning.
2) Finding that EI outperforms more complex approaches like PPO.
3) Identifying the low sample complexity requirements. 
4) Showing RL training can avoid accuracy trade-offs suffered during static supervised training.
5) Discussing model exploration being a key limitation to further improvement from RL.

The paper provides useful insights into the potential for and limitations of using RL to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities. Key takeaways are around the strong performance of simple EI, the lack of complex exploration limiting gains, and opportunities to address exploration in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively studies various reinforcement learning algorithms for improving reasoning capabilities of large language models, finding that the simple Expert Iteration method performs the best across metrics while exhibiting surprisingly comparable sample efficiency to more complex methods like PPO, indicating limited exploration beyond the models' existing knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A comprehensive study comparing different RL algorithms (Expert Iteration, PPO, Return-Conditioned RL) for improving reasoning capabilities of large language models, using different rewards, model sizes, and initializations. 

2) Finding that Expert Iteration reliably achieves the best performance across settings while having competitive sample complexity to PPO.

3) Identifying limited exploration as a major bottleneck to further improvement of LLMs via RL, suggesting more sophisticated prompting strategies or combining LLMs with search/evolutionary algorithms as promising future directions.

4) Observing that RL fine-tuning simultaneously improves greedy (maj@1) performance while maintaining or improving the best (pass@n) performance, unlike continued supervised fine-tuning which leads to overfitting on the train set.

Does this accurately summarize the main contributions of the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares multiple RL algorithms including Expert Iteration (EI), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Return-Conditioned RL (RCRL). Can you explain the key differences in how these algorithms approach policy improvement? What are the trade-offs between them?

2. The paper frames mathematical reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). What are the key components that allow formulating reasoning in this way? What are some limitations of this formulation? 

3. The paper finds that Expert Iteration (EI) attains the best performance across different settings. Why might EI be particularly well-suited for improving reasoning capabilities compared to other algorithms like PPO?

4. Both EI and PPO are found to converge quickly, often requiring less than 100k samples. The paper hypothesizes this is due to limited exploration. Can you elaborate on what factors may constrain the exploration space during RL fine-tuning and how this might explain the fast convergence?

5. The paper introduces the idea of a stepwise ORM (SORM) to provide step-level reward signal during RCRL training. How does a SORM differ from a regular ORM? What are some challenges in effectively training a SORM?

6. The paper finds that RCRL models fail to effectively utilize negative demonstrations during training. What modifications could be made to the RCRL framework or data generation process to better leverage negative examples? 

7. The paper identifies overfitting to the train set as a key limitation during supervised fine-tuning. How does overfitting manifest and why does RL fine-tuning help mitigate this issue?

8. The paper experiments with techniques like backtracking and prioritized level replay to construct a curriculum during RL training. Why do these techniques fail to outperform the baseline PPO algorithm?

9. The paper attempts to generate synthetic training data via backtranslation, but finds that this degrades performance. What underlying issues explain why the synthetic data fails to improve the model?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on mathematical reasoning tasks. How might the conclusions change if applied to more open-ended reasoning domains? What new challenges might arise?
