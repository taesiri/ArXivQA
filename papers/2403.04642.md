# [Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it compares different RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Expert Iteration (EI), and Return-Conditioned RL (RCRL) on mathematical reasoning tasks. The goal is to understand how these algorithms perform in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency when fine-tuning LLMs.

Methods:
The paper frames mathematical reasoning as a Markov Decision Process. Different rewards schemes are tested including sparse, dense, and learned rewards from outcome-based reward models. Experiments are done on 7B and 13B parameter Llamas, initialized both from scratch and from supervised fine-tuned checkpoints. Performance is evaluated using metrics like maj@1, maj@96, rerank@96, and pass@96 accuracy.

Key Findings:
- EI performs the best overall, achieving top accuracy across metrics and competitive sample efficiency to PPO. 
- Neither algorithm benefits much from extra guidance like outcome-based rewards or dense rewards.
- In contrast to continued supervised training, RL training improves both maj@1 and pass@96 simultaneously.
- Sample complexity for convergence is surprisingly low even without supervised pretraining, requiring only ~60K samples for both EI and PPO.
- Larger models generate more diverse solutions during RL fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensive comparison of RL algorithms for improving LLM reasoning.
2) Finding that EI outperforms more complex approaches like PPO.
3) Identifying the low sample complexity requirements. 
4) Showing RL training can avoid accuracy trade-offs suffered during static supervised training.
5) Discussing model exploration being a key limitation to further improvement from RL.

The paper provides useful insights into the potential for and limitations of using RL to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities. Key takeaways are around the strong performance of simple EI, the lack of complex exploration limiting gains, and opportunities to address exploration in future work.
