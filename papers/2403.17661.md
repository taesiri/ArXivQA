# [Language Models for Text Classification: Is In-Context Learning Enough?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17661)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text classification is important for many applications, but requires large labeled datasets which are costly to obtain. Recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for low-resource classification via prompting, but lack systemic comparison to fine-tuning methods.

Methods:
- Evaluate 5 models on 16 text classification datasets spanning binary, multi-class, and multi-label problems across 7 domains. 
- Compare prompting techniques (zero-shot and one-shot learning) using Flan-T5, LLaMA, and GPT-3 to fine-tuning methods using RoBERTa and T5.
- Analyze trends across prompts, model types, classification types, domains, and number of labels.

Key Findings:
- Flan-T5 outperforms LLaMA in both zero-shot and one-shot prompting, showing the benefit of instruction tuning for text classification.  
- Prompting techniques match or beat fine-tuning methods in low-resource settings for binary and multi-class problems.
- However, fine-tuning smaller models still substantially outperforms prompting of larger LLMs given sufficient labeled data, especially for multi-label problems.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale systemic comparison of prompting vs fine-tuning methods for diverse text classification problems.
- Analysis of trends across models, classification types, domains etc. highlighting strengths/weaknesses.  
- Evidence that while promising, LLMs still underperform compared to fine-tuning on ample data, motivating further improvement to prompting techniques.

In summary, the paper provides new insight into how current LLMs compare to established methods for text classification across diverse tasks and data scenarios. The results highlight promising capabilities but also limitations of existing prompting approaches.
