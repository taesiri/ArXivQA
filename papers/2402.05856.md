# [Structure-Informed Protein Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Protein language models (PLMs) like ESM have shown promise in learning representations of proteins from their sequences. However, they lack explicit supervision from protein structural information, which is relevant to protein functions.  
- Recent methods have incorporated structural information by taking both sequences and structures as input. But this requires obtaining protein structures, which adds computational burden and limits application to proteins without solved structures.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes incorporating structural information into PLMs through fine-tuning on remote homology detection tasks. This aims to identify proteins with similar structures but low sequence identity.
- They fine-tune ESM-2 models on a dataset of proteins categorized by folding patterns. The model is trained to predict the fold label from the protein sequence.  
- This injects structural information into the PLMs without needing explicit protein structures as input. The resulting structure-informed PLMs are evaluated on various downstream tasks.

Key Results:
- Structure-informed ESMs show consistent improvements in function annotation tasks like EC number and Gene Ontology prediction over vanilla ESMs. This demonstrates their improved modeling of structure-function relationships.
- However, performance varies on tasks related to protein mutation effects. This depends on whether sequence evolution or protein structures more strongly determine the property.
- Evaluations on practical enzyme annotation tasks further show that incorporating structural information improves performance, especially on challenging datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes remote homology detection fine-tuning to incorporate structural information into protein language models without requiring explicit protein structures.
- Evaluates structure-informed PLMs on various function prediction tasks and analyzes performance based on the structure-function relationship.
- Shows consistent benefits in function annotation but mixed impacts on mutation tasks, highlighting the need to consider this relationship.
- Provides insights into effectively applying structure-aware training to enhance protein representation learning.
