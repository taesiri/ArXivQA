# [Evolving machine learning workflows through interactive AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automatic workflow composition (AWC) is an important problem in automated machine learning (AutoML). Existing AWC methods use predefined schemas for composing ML workflows and fully automate the search process without user intervention. This limits the ability of users to incorporate their domain knowledge and preferences. There is a need for AWC methods that support higher levels of human guidance and customization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes iEvoFlow, an interactive grammar-guided genetic programming algorithm for AWC. iEvoFlow allows users to dynamically modify the grammar that defines valid ML workflows during the evolutionary search process. By pruning unwanted algorithms and hyperparameter values from the grammar, users can guide the search towards interesting regions of the solution space. An interactive interface shows population statistics and recommended elements to remove at each interaction point. 

The user provides feedback in two ways - by setting thresholds on accuracy and evaluation time to isolate undesirable workflows, and by selecting algorithms and hyperparameter values to eliminate from the grammar. The modifications persist for the remaining generations. Multiple interactions can occur according to a flexible schedule defined by the user.

Contributions:

- Novel concept of interactive evolutionary AWC, combining the advantages of grammar-based genetic programming and ideas from interactive optimisation and human-guided ML.

- Design of interactive mechanisms tailored to the AWC problem, including relevant statistics to support user decisions and grammar modification options.

- Implementation of the approach as iEvoFlow and development of a web-based graphical interface.

- Extensive experimentation, including simulations with different user profiles and a user study with 20 participants on a real dataset.

- Empirical demonstration that human guidance helps iEvoFlow find high quality workflows faster compared to the non-interactive version, with over 75% of participants improving accuracy, evaluation time or both.

- Analysis of user preferences regarding algorithms and hyperparameter values removed during interactions.

- Positive user feedback on the interactivity, with participants perceiving iEvoFlow as useful to understand the AWC problem and find alternative solutions.
