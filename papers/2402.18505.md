# [Evolving machine learning workflows through interactive AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automatic workflow composition (AWC) is an important problem in automated machine learning (AutoML). Existing AWC methods use predefined schemas for composing ML workflows and fully automate the search process without user intervention. This limits the ability of users to incorporate their domain knowledge and preferences. There is a need for AWC methods that support higher levels of human guidance and customization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes iEvoFlow, an interactive grammar-guided genetic programming algorithm for AWC. iEvoFlow allows users to dynamically modify the grammar that defines valid ML workflows during the evolutionary search process. By pruning unwanted algorithms and hyperparameter values from the grammar, users can guide the search towards interesting regions of the solution space. An interactive interface shows population statistics and recommended elements to remove at each interaction point. 

The user provides feedback in two ways - by setting thresholds on accuracy and evaluation time to isolate undesirable workflows, and by selecting algorithms and hyperparameter values to eliminate from the grammar. The modifications persist for the remaining generations. Multiple interactions can occur according to a flexible schedule defined by the user.

Contributions:

- Novel concept of interactive evolutionary AWC, combining the advantages of grammar-based genetic programming and ideas from interactive optimisation and human-guided ML.

- Design of interactive mechanisms tailored to the AWC problem, including relevant statistics to support user decisions and grammar modification options.

- Implementation of the approach as iEvoFlow and development of a web-based graphical interface.

- Extensive experimentation, including simulations with different user profiles and a user study with 20 participants on a real dataset.

- Empirical demonstration that human guidance helps iEvoFlow find high quality workflows faster compared to the non-interactive version, with over 75% of participants improving accuracy, evaluation time or both.

- Analysis of user preferences regarding algorithms and hyperparameter values removed during interactions.

- Positive user feedback on the interactivity, with participants perceiving iEvoFlow as useful to understand the AWC problem and find alternative solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents iEvoFlow, an interactive grammar-guided genetic programming approach for automatic workflow composition that allows users to dynamically modify the grammar to prune the search space and focus on regions of interest according to their preferences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is an interactive grammar-guided genetic programming (G3P) algorithm called "iEvoFlow" for automatic workflow composition (AWC). Specifically:

- iEvoFlow allows users to dynamically modify the grammar during the evolutionary search process to prune the search space and focus on regions of interest. This combines the advantages of G3P for AWC with ideas from interactive optimization and human-guided machine learning.

- The interactive approach allows users to remove specific algorithms and hyperparameter values from the grammar definition across generations. This guides iEvoFlow to explore the search space more efficiently based on human preferences.

- The paper presents experiments with both simulated users and 20 human participants interacting with iEvoFlow. Results show that human intervention helps iEvoFlow find high-performance workflows in terms of accuracy and evaluation time compared to runs without interaction.

- The authors state that iEvoFlow is the first AWC algorithm that supports human-in-the-loop and one of the few interactive AutoML proposals that performs empirical evaluation with humans.

In summary, the main contribution is an interactive grammar-based genetic programming method for AWC that integrates human guidance, along with experimental validation of its utility.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the context-free grammar (CFG) used in iEvoFlow allow for flexible adaptation based on human feedback? What specific components of the CFG get modified?

2. The paper proposes an interactive reoptimization approach for incorporating human feedback. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to other types of interactive optimization methods like interactive evolutionary algorithms?

3. What statistics and visualizations does the iEvoFlow interface provide to users to help them understand the impact of different algorithms and hyperparameters? How could these be enhanced further? 

4. The scheduling of human interactions in iEvoFlow seems quite flexible. How might an adaptive interaction schedule that considers search progress perform compared to the fixed one proposed?

5. Could constructive preferences, like allowing users to manually edit workflow components, further improve the performance and experience of using iEvoFlow? What challenges might this introduce?

6. The user study evaluates iEvoFlow on a single dataset. How might results differ across datasets with varying size, number of features, number of classes etc.?

7. Beyond accuracy and evaluation time, what other objectives could be incorporated into iEvoFlow's multi-objective perspective? How might the interaction mechanisms need to be adapted?

8. How suitable is iEvoFlow for non-expert users compared to expert data scientists? What enhancements could improve understandability for non-experts?

9. The user study only considers a single interaction session per user. How might user fatigue and familiarity affect interaction quality over multiple sessions? 

10. The paper compares against a non-interactive version of the algorithm. How might iEvoFlow compare against other state-of-the-art AutoML and neural architecture search methods?
