# [Seeing the Unseen: Visual Common Sense for Semantic Placement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper proposes a new computer vision task called "Semantic Placement" (SP) where given an image (e.g. a living room) and an object name (e.g. "cushion"), the goal is to predict a pixel-level mask highlighting regions in the image where that object could plausibly be placed by a human (e.g. on the sofa). This requires reasoning about what objects would go where even if they are not present in the image. This is a very challenging task but could enable applications like assistive robots tidying up a room or AR devices rendering virtual objects.  

Proposed Solution:
- They propose a novel automated data pipeline that starts with images that contain the target object, uses inpainting models to remove it, and outputs image pairs with/without the object along with placement masks. This lets them train on real images at scale without manual annotation.

- They collect a large dataset called LAION-SP with 1.3M images across 9 categories using this pipeline. They use object detectors and inpainting models like Lama and Stable Diffusion.

- They also collect a small high-quality synthetic dataset from photorealistic 3D scenes in Habitat simulator where objects can be cleanly removed from scenes.

- They train a model called CLIP-UNet which uses a CLIP backbone and UNet decoder. It is first pretrained on LAION-SP data and then finetuned on the synthetic dataset. 

- They introduce metrics like Target Precision and Receptacle Surface Precision/Recall to evaluate precision of placements and understanding of where objects typically go.

Main Contributions:

- Proposing the novel challenging task of Semantic Placement

- An automated data pipeline to generate training data from web images using foundation models

- A large-scale SP dataset LAION-SP

- A CLIP-UNet model and training methodology combining real and synthetic data

- Quantitative evaluation showing their method outperforms baselines like VLMs and detector+LLM methods

- Demonstrating the utility of SP predictions for tidying robots in Embodied SP experiments

The key insight is to make the invisible visible by removing objects and using the context, making it possible to collect data and train models for this very challenging visual common sense task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the task of Semantic Placement to predict where unseen objects could be placed in images, collects a large-scale dataset using inpainting and data augmentation, develops a CLIP-UNet model that outperforms baselines, and shows the model's predictions enable an embodied tidying robot to successfully place objects in simulated environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. Proposing a novel task called Semantic Placement (SP), where given an image and an object name, a vision system must predict a semantic mask indicating where that object could plausibly be placed in the image.

2. An automated data pipeline leveraging inpainting and object detection models to generate training data and supervise an end-to-end SP prediction model using real-world images, without expensive human annotation.

3. A novel data augmentation method to alleviate overfitting to inpainting artifacts. 

4. The proposed SP prediction model, called CLIP-UNet, produces masks that generalize well to real images, are preferred by humans over baselines, and enable downstream robot task execution for tidying environments.

In summary, the key contribution is defining the novel SP task, an automated data pipeline to train a model for this task, and showing that the predictions enable robot tidying in real environments.
