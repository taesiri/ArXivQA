# [Scalable Human-Machine Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for point cloud analysis tasks like classification are computationally expensive, making inference difficult on resource-constrained edge devices. 
- Transmitting point clouds to the cloud for server-side processing requires compressing them first. Using codecs optimized for human viewing spends bits on unnecessary details. This results in poor rate-accuracy trade-offs.
- Applications need to support both machine analysis and occasional human review. No existing point cloud codec is optimized for both.

Proposed Solution:
- A scalable learned codec for point cloud classification that has two bitstreams - a base bitstream for classification, and an enhancement bitstream for reconstruction.
- Base bitstream is specialized for classification by removing statistical and task-irrelevant redundancies. This improves rate-accuracy. 
- Enhancement bitstream improves reconstruction quality when the point cloud needs to be viewed by a human.
- Overall architecture is based on PointNet++, with set abstraction layers, feature compression blocks, upsampling blocks and scalable compression of final features.

Main Contributions:
- First scalable multi-task learned codec for point clouds supporting both machine classification and human viewing.
- Specialized base bitstream significantly improves rate-accuracy over regular codecs.
- Quality-scalable reconstruction competitive with state-of-the-art at low rates.
- Demonstrates efficacy of proposed codec on ModelNet40 dataset, outperforming prior specialized and non-specialized codecs.
