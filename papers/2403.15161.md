## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FastCAD: Real-Time CAD Retrieval and Alignment from Scans and Videos":

Problem:
Representing environments and rooms with aligned 3D CAD models is important for many applications like augmented reality and robotics. Compared to noisy 3D meshes, a CAD representation is more compact, has clean geometry, contains object annotations and enables faster rendering and collision detection. However, current state-of-the-art methods for retrieving and aligning CAD models are slow, taking minutes to hours per scene. This makes them impractical for real-time applications.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FastCAD, a real-time method to simultaneously retrieve CAD models and align them to a 3D point cloud scan of a scene. 

Key ideas:
- Directly predict CAD alignment parameters (bounding box, orientation) and shape embeddings in a single shot using an efficient convolutional neural network, instead of slower iterative alignment procedures. 
- Learn a joint shape embedding space for CAD models and partial scans using contrastive learning. Embeddings capture shape similarity to enable robust nearest neighbor CAD retrieval.
- Distill the learned embeddings into the FastCAD network by supervising its shape predictions, avoiding a separate slow embedding network at test time.
- Optionally integrate FastCAD with an online 3D reconstruction method taking an RGB video as input to enable online CAD-based reconstruction from video at 10 FPS.

Main Contributions:
- A real-time CAD alignment method that is 50x faster than previous scan alignment methods while achieving better accuracy on the Scan2CAD benchmark (61.7% vs 61.2% instance accuracy).
- Enabling online CAD-based 3D reconstruction from video at 10 FPS by combining with a reconstruction method, significantly outperforming prior video alignment works in accuracy and speed.  
- New evaluation metrics to assess shape quality in addition to alignment accuracy.
- State-of-the-art video alignment accuracy on Scan2CAD benchmark while running more than 3x faster than best competitor (48.2% vs 43% accuracy at 100ms vs >300ms per frame).

In summary, FastCAD pushes the boundaries of CAD-based dense 3D perception to real-time rates without sacrificing quality. The efficiency unlocks new live applications in VR/AR and robotics.
