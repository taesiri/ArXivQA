# [HARP: Personalized Hand Reconstruction from a Monocular RGB Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09530)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main goal of this paper is to develop HARP (HAnd Reconstruction and Personalization), a method for creating personalized and photo-realistic hand avatars from monocular RGB videos. The key research questions/hypotheses are:

- Can we create high-fidelity hand avatars with personalized geometry and appearance using only a short monocular RGB video captured by a commodity camera? 

- Can standard explicit representations like meshes and maps, combined with differentiable rendering, reconstruct hand avatars of similar or better quality compared to recent implicit neural representations?

- Is the resulting avatar robust and effective for novel view synthesis, novel pose synthesis, and improving 3D hand pose estimation?

- Can all this be achieved with a scalable and efficient optimization framework without relying on large datasets or neural network training?

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that by disentangling geometry, appearance and lighting with explicit representations and carefully designed differentiable rendering, high-quality hand avatars can be reconstructed from monocular RGB videos. This is in contrast to recent trends of using implicit neural representations. The explicit nature also allows for efficient optimization and compatibility with graphics applications. Experiments validate the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the proposed HARP method for appearance reconstruction, novel view/pose synthesis, and hand pose refinement.

In summary, the main goal is developing a scalable avatar creation framework using explicit representations and differentiable rendering, and validating its effectiveness compared to implicit neural approaches. The key hypothesis is that explicit models with proper disentanglement can reconstruct high-fidelity hand avatars from short monocular videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting HARP, a method for creating personalized hand avatars from monocular RGB videos. Specifically:

- HARP reconstructs high-fidelity hand geometry and appearance from short monocular RGB videos captured by a hand-held mobile phone. It outputs a textured triangle mesh that exhibits the personalized shape and appearance of the hand.

- The key advantage of HARP is the use of explicit representations (mesh, normal map, albedo map) and differentiable rendering without any neural networks. This makes it accurate, robust, efficient, and exportable to graphics applications.

- HARP introduces a shadow-aware differentiable rendering scheme that handles self-shadowing and lighting to enable optimization from in-the-wild capture conditions. 

- The resulting hand avatar can be re-posed and rendered realistically in novel views, which is useful for VR/AR. The explicit representation is also convenient to export for graphics applications.

- Additionally, HARP can improve 3D hand pose estimation using the reconstructed appearance, if available, by optimizing the pose parameters through differentiable rendering.

- The method is thoroughly evaluated for appearance reconstruction, novel view synthesis, out-of-distribution appearance generalization, and pose refinement. It shows superior performance compared to other hand avatar creation techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an efficient and robust framework for personalized hand avatar creation from monocular RGB videos for graphics and VR/AR applications. The key advantages come from the use of explicit representations and differentiable rendering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents HARP, a method for reconstructing a realistic personalized hand avatar from a short monocular RGB video. The key idea is to use standard explicit representations like a mesh, normal map, and albedo texture together with a differentiable renderer, avoiding any neural components. This results in an efficient, robust, and scalable approach that can create high-fidelity hand avatars from videos captured by a handheld phone. The reconstructed avatar exhibits faithful personalized geometry and appearance, can generate realistic novel views and poses, and can potentially improve hand pose estimation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents HARP, a method for personalizing hand geometry and appearance from monocular RGB videos. It makes several notable contributions compared to prior work on hand reconstruction and modeling:

- It uses explicit representations (mesh, normal map, albedo map) rather than implicit neural representations. This makes the results more interpretable, controllable, and compatible with standard graphics pipelines. Many recent methods rely on implicit neural models which can lack these desirable properties.

- It focuses on optimizing hand geometry and appearance from short monocular RGB videos, which is a very practical scenario for AR/VR avatar creation. In contrast, some recent work requires multi-view capture systems and large amounts of data/compute (e.g. LISA).  

- The differentiable rendering approach allows jointly optimizing geometry, appearance, and lighting without needing pre-trained neural networks. Many methods pretrain appearance models which limits their flexibility.

- It demonstrates hand pose refinement by optimizing with a known appearance model. This is a novel application of differentiable rendering for hand pose estimation.

- The method is robust to challenging hand motions, lighting changes, and produces convincing novel view synthesis - outperforming baselines in comparisons.

Overall, HARP demonstrates that with careful design and implementation, a classical graphics pipeline with explicit representations can produce compelling hand avatars from very limited input data. This contrasts the trend of purely implicit neural approaches that often require much more data. The ideas in HARP could help democratize avatar creation and improve hand AR/VR experiences.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several interesting future research directions:

1. Developing techniques for estimating and reconstructing more complex hand shapes and geometries beyond what is representable by MANO or linear shape models. They suggest leveraging more detailed depth data or larger amounts of training images to achieve this.

2. Incorporating an environment map, modeling bounced lighting, and increasing rendered texture resolution to achieve even more photorealism in the rendered results.

3. Exploring ways to condition the displacement map on hand pose, to better model pose-dependent surface deformations. The authors acknowledge limitations in the current approach where MANO blend shapes and the displacement map can conflict.

4. Improving the optimization speed and hand pose estimation accuracy to enable real-time pose refinement using the appearance consistency losses. This could be useful for an AR/VR user doing an initial hand-flipping motion to provide appearance reference to improve subsequent pose estimation.

5. Capturing a large-scale dataset designed specifically for hand avatar creation, with monocular in-the-wild captures using commodity phones/cameras. The authors designed their own dataset but it is still relatively small. A larger dataset could enable training data-driven components.

6. Extending the explicit mesh and texture optimization approach to full body avatars and exploring whether similar benefits arise compared to implicit neural approaches in that domain.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving photorealism, generalization of shape/appearance, speed, integrating with data-driven methods, and extending the approach to related avatar creation domains like bodies. The paper provides a strong foundation and proof-of-concept for explicit optimization of hand avatars.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents HARP, a method for creating personalized hand avatars from monocular RGB videos. The key idea is to reconstruct high-fidelity hand geometry and appearance using standard explicit representations like meshes, normal maps, and albedos along with differentiable rendering, avoiding any neural network components. Given a short input video of a hand captured by a smartphone, HARP optimizes the parameters of a parametric hand model, vertex displacements, texture maps, and lighting using an analysis-by-synthesis approach to match the input images. Careful design of the differentiable rendering allows properly handling challenging hand articulations and self-shadowing.  

The benefits of this explicit optimization-based approach are demonstrated through experiments on hand appearance reconstruction, novel view synthesis, novel pose synthesis, and hand pose estimation. The results show HARP can faithfully reconstruct personalized hand shape and appearance from only a short monocular RGB video. The reconstructed avatar generalizes well to novel views and poses. HARP also outperforms state-of-the-art hand appearance models like MANO and Nimble qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, HARP's appearance can be used to improve 3D hand pose estimation compared to using only masks or silhouettes. The simplicity and explicit nature of HARP makes the resulting avatar model easy to export for graphics applications. Overall, HARP provides an accurate, robust, and scalable approach to reconstructing hand avatars from casual monocular videos.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method presented in this paper is HARP, which stands for Hand Articulation and Reconstruction Pipeline. HARP is a personalized hand avatar creation approach that takes as input a short monocular RGB video of a human hand and reconstructs a realistic 3D hand model with personalized shape and appearance. 

The key aspects of the HARP method are:

- It represents the hand using a parametric model consisting of a template mesh, vertex displacements, an albedo map, and a normal map. This allows explicit control over the hand geometry and appearance.

- The hand model parameters are optimized by comparing rendered images to the input video frames using differentiable rendering. This includes a shadow-aware rasterizer and shader to handle self-shadowing and lighting.

- The optimization is done in multiple stages, starting with just geometry alignment, then joint geometry and appearance, and finally appearance only. This allows the complex factors to be disentangled.

- The resulting hand avatar model can be re-posed and rendered realistically in novel views and articulations. It can also improve 3D hand pose estimation compared to just using the original video frames.

In summary, HARP shows that with careful modeling and optimization, high-fidelity personalized hand avatars can be obtained from monocular RGB video using standard graphics representations and differentiable rendering, without needing complex neural implicit models. The hand models are animatable and exportable for graphics applications.
