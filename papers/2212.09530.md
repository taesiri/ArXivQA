# [HARP: Personalized Hand Reconstruction from a Monocular RGB Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09530)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main goal of this paper is to develop HARP (HAnd Reconstruction and Personalization), a method for creating personalized and photo-realistic hand avatars from monocular RGB videos. The key research questions/hypotheses are:

- Can we create high-fidelity hand avatars with personalized geometry and appearance using only a short monocular RGB video captured by a commodity camera? 

- Can standard explicit representations like meshes and maps, combined with differentiable rendering, reconstruct hand avatars of similar or better quality compared to recent implicit neural representations?

- Is the resulting avatar robust and effective for novel view synthesis, novel pose synthesis, and improving 3D hand pose estimation?

- Can all this be achieved with a scalable and efficient optimization framework without relying on large datasets or neural network training?

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that by disentangling geometry, appearance and lighting with explicit representations and carefully designed differentiable rendering, high-quality hand avatars can be reconstructed from monocular RGB videos. This is in contrast to recent trends of using implicit neural representations. The explicit nature also allows for efficient optimization and compatibility with graphics applications. Experiments validate the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the proposed HARP method for appearance reconstruction, novel view/pose synthesis, and hand pose refinement.

In summary, the main goal is developing a scalable avatar creation framework using explicit representations and differentiable rendering, and validating its effectiveness compared to implicit neural approaches. The key hypothesis is that explicit models with proper disentanglement can reconstruct high-fidelity hand avatars from short monocular videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting HARP, a method for creating personalized hand avatars from monocular RGB videos. Specifically:

- HARP reconstructs high-fidelity hand geometry and appearance from short monocular RGB videos captured by a hand-held mobile phone. It outputs a textured triangle mesh that exhibits the personalized shape and appearance of the hand.

- The key advantage of HARP is the use of explicit representations (mesh, normal map, albedo map) and differentiable rendering without any neural networks. This makes it accurate, robust, efficient, and exportable to graphics applications.

- HARP introduces a shadow-aware differentiable rendering scheme that handles self-shadowing and lighting to enable optimization from in-the-wild capture conditions. 

- The resulting hand avatar can be re-posed and rendered realistically in novel views, which is useful for VR/AR. The explicit representation is also convenient to export for graphics applications.

- Additionally, HARP can improve 3D hand pose estimation using the reconstructed appearance, if available, by optimizing the pose parameters through differentiable rendering.

- The method is thoroughly evaluated for appearance reconstruction, novel view synthesis, out-of-distribution appearance generalization, and pose refinement. It shows superior performance compared to other hand avatar creation techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an efficient and robust framework for personalized hand avatar creation from monocular RGB videos for graphics and VR/AR applications. The key advantages come from the use of explicit representations and differentiable rendering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents HARP, a method for reconstructing a realistic personalized hand avatar from a short monocular RGB video. The key idea is to use standard explicit representations like a mesh, normal map, and albedo texture together with a differentiable renderer, avoiding any neural components. This results in an efficient, robust, and scalable approach that can create high-fidelity hand avatars from videos captured by a handheld phone. The reconstructed avatar exhibits faithful personalized geometry and appearance, can generate realistic novel views and poses, and can potentially improve hand pose estimation.
