# [MP-SL: Multihop Parallel Split Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "MP-SL: Multihop Parallel Split Learning":

Problem: 
- Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning model training while keeping data decentralized on user devices. However, resource-constrained devices like mobiles and IoT devices struggle to perform on-device training due to limited compute resources and memory. 
- Techniques like parallel split learning help offload training to compute nodes but have high memory demands. For example, training VGG-19 with 100 clients needs 80GB memory per compute node.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MultiHop Parallel Split Learning (MP-SL), a distributed learning framework that combines split learning with pipeline parallelism to reduce memory demands per compute node. 
- It supports multihop split learning by partitioning the model into multiple parts and utilizing multiple compute nodes in a pipelined manner. This relaxes memory requirements per node allowing the use of cheaper nodes.

Main Contributions:
- MP-SL is the first parallel split learning framework with multihop support. It is modular, extensible and publicly available.
- An analytical model is provided to estimate system performance with <3.86% error. This is the first work to model and optimize splitting selection for multihop split learning.
- Evaluations on a testbed show MP-SL is robust to heterogeneous devices and can significantly reduce compute node costs with a small training time increase. For example, cost reduced by 55% with 1.5x slower training.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel multihop parallel split learning framework that can efficiently train models on resource-constrained devices by partitioning training across cheaper compute nodes in a pipelined manner. Evaluations demonstrate its robustness and cost benefits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 MP-SL is a modular distributed learning framework that combines split learning with pipeline parallelism across multiple compute nodes to enable resource-constrained devices to participate in collaborative model training while reducing memory demands and cost compared to alternative approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. MP-SL is the first Parallel Split Learning-based framework with multihop support. It is modular, easily extensible to support any model type, and is publicly available.

2. The paper provides and validates an analytical model for estimating the expected performance of MP-SL. The analytical model is shown to provide estimates of the measured system performance with an error less than 3.86%. 

3. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that models and optimizes the splitting selection for multihop Split Learning.

4. The paper evaluates MP-SL for a wide range of scenarios using a realistic testbed. It shows that the proposed protocol is robust to the stragglers effect and can significantly reduce the cost of the compute nodes with a slight increase in the training time.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the MP-SL framework for multihop Parallel Split Learning, along with its modeling, optimization, and evaluation. MP-SL enables resource-constrained devices to participate in distributed model training with improved scalability and lower compute node costs compared to prior Split Learning approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Multihop Parallel Split Learning (MP-SL): The proposed distributed learning framework that combines split learning with pipeline parallelism to enable resource-constrained devices to participate in collaborative model training.

- Split Learning: An approach where a neural network model is split into multiple parts which are trained separately on different devices/nodes and only activations or gradients are exchanged. Helps reduce communication costs.  

- Pipeline Parallelism: A parallelization strategy that partitions a neural network across stages and runs them sequentially in a pipelined manner to reduce end-to-end latency. 

- Model splitting optimization: The paper formulates and solves an optimization problem to determine optimal intermediate split points in the model to minimize training latency.

- Analytical performance model: An analytical model is presented and validated to estimate expected training time in MP-SL under different system configurations.

- Cost reduction: Key benefit of MP-SL is the ability to use less powerful and cheaper compute nodes without significantly increasing training time.

- Robustness to heterogeneity: The pipelined approach makes MP-SL robust to heterogeneity in terms of compute capabilities and network capacities across devices.

In summary, the key focus is on a pipelined multihop split learning framework to enable collaborative distributed training with lower resource devices in a robust and cost-effective manner.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a multihop parallel split learning (MP-SL) framework. How does supporting multihop configurations in parallel split learning help improve scalability and reduce resource requirements compared to standard parallel split learning?

2) The paper mentions using an optimization method to determine the best intermediate split points in the model to minimize training latency. Can you explain in more detail the optimization problem that is formulated and solved? What is the decision variable and what constraints are considered?

3) In the pipeline parallelism approach used in MP-SL, how exactly are the forward and backward passes orchestrated across the multiple hops? Walk through an example scenario with 3 hops and explain the timeline of operations.  

4) The paper argues MP-SL enables knowledge concealment by splitting models into more parts across hops. Can you expand on what types of privacy attacks multihop configurations help defend against compared to single-hop split learning?

5) How does the analytical performance model account for heterogeneous data owners and links between entities? What assumptions are made to avoid over-complicating the model?

6) When validating the analytical model against testbed experiments, what causes some deviation in the results? And why does the error increase as the number of data owners grows?

7) For the experiments with heterogeneous data owners, why does the training time difference between the fastest and slowest cases remain quite small under MP-SL but not under SplitNN?

8) When comparing multihop MP-SL against horizontally scaled parallel split learning, what drives the tradeoff decisions regarding cost versus training speed? 

9) The optimization method for determining split points uses an ILP solver. What causes the solving time to grow more sensitive to the number of compute nodes versus the number of potential split points?

10) The paper focuses on collaborative training of deep learning models. What modifications would need to be made to support other machine learning algorithms under the MP-SL framework?
