# [HumanMAC: Masked Motion Completion for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03665)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve upon existing human motion prediction methods that use an encoder-decoder architecture by instead framing the problem as a masked motion completion task?The key issues with existing encoder-decoder human motion prediction methods that the paper identifies are:- They rely on multiple complicated loss functions which makes tuning difficult. - They require multi-stage training pipelines which are cumbersome to implement.- They struggle to generate diverse motions that switch between different types of motions.To address these issues, the paper proposes a new framework called HumanMAC that takes a masked motion completion approach. The key ideas are:- Train a motion diffusion model to generate motions from noise. - At inference time, add noise to the observed motions and iteratively denoise using the model, masking out the unobserved parts. - This allows conditioning the predicted motions on the observations while only needing a single training loss.- Training is end-to-end rather than requiring separate stages.- Modeling the complete motion holistically allows generating motions that switch between types.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that formulating human motion prediction as a masked completion task can overcome limitations of existing encoder-decoder approaches related to losses, training, and motion diversity. The experiments aim to validate that the proposed HumanMAC method outperforms encoder-decoder baselines on these criteria.
