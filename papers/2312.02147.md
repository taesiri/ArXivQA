# [Rejuvenating image-GPT as Strong Visual Representation Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02147)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes D-iGPT, an enhanced version of image GPT (iGPT) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet classification using only publicly available datasets. D-iGPT makes two key modifications to iGPT: (1) it shifts the prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens provided by CLIP, enabling more high-level understanding of image content, and (2) it adds supervision on visible tokens using a separate discriminative decoder, supplementing the main autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments show D-iGPT significantly outperforms masked image modeling approaches like MAE and prior autoregressive methods across tasks like classification, segmentation, and robustness evaluation. Notably, D-iGPT attains 89.5% ImageNet accuracy using only public data, comparable to private data models with billions of parameters. The simplicity yet effectiveness of D-iGPT demonstrates autoregressive pre-training is highly scalable and should inspire more research on vision foundation models.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent progress in computer vision has favored BERT-style pre-training over autoregressive pre-training like image GPT (iGPT). However, the authors argue that with proper modifications, autoregressive pretraining can be highly effective for visual representation learning. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose D-iGPT, an enhanced version of iGPT with two key modifications:

1) Shift prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens provided by a model like CLIP. This enables modeling higher-level visual concepts rather than just pixels.

2) Add supervision by making the model predict not just the next token, but also visible tokens. This is implemented via a separate discriminative decoder.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a novel approach of adapting autoregressive models like iGPT to computer vision by using semantic tokens and adding discriminative supervision. Show this is highly effective when tokens come from discriminative models like CLIP.

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with 89.5% top-1 accuracy using publicly available datasets and a ViT-Large model. Significantly outperforms prior works like MAE and EVA.

- Demonstrate exceptional performance on downstream tasks like segmentation and robustness to out-of-distribution data. E.g. achieve 57.3 mIoU on ADE20K segmentation using a ViT-Large model.

- Provides ablation studies analyzing impact of different design choices like tokenizers, pretraining paradigms, decoder architectures etc. Reveal insights like importance of discriminative supervision and larger datasets.

In summary, the authors successfully demonstrate that properly designed autoregressive models can achieve compelling performance for visual representation learning, challenging the trend towards BERT-style pre-training approaches.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing D-iGPT, an enhanced version of image GPT (iGPT) for visual representation learning. Specifically, D-iGPT makes two key modifications:

1) It shifts the prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens derived from models like CLIP, enabling a higher-level understanding of image content. 

2) It supplements the autoregressive modeling by adding supervision to predict not only the next tokens but also the visible tokens. This is implemented via a discriminative decoder in addition to the generative decoder.

The combination of these two modifications leads to state-of-the-art performance. Notably, D-iGPT achieves 89.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a ViT-Large model trained solely on public datasets. This is the key achievement highlighted in the paper.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an enhanced autoregressive pretraining approach called D-iGPT that achieves compelling performance for visual representation learning, including state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy using publicly available data.
