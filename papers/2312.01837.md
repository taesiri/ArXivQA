# [Prompting Disentangled Embeddings for Knowledge Graph Completion with   Pre-trained Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01837)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PDKGC, a novel prompt-tuning based method for knowledge graph completion. PDKGC is built on top of a frozen pre-trained language model and incorporates both textual and structural information through two specialized prompts. It includes a disentangled graph learner to capture multiple semantic aspects of entities via relation-aware neighborhood attention. These disentangled entity embeddings are projected into a prompt sequence which is fed into the language model along with the textual description of the triple, reformulated as a masking task via a hard prompt. This allows the language model to predict the missing entity by fusing relevant structure and text knowledge. Additionally, a separate structural predictor feeds the disentangled embeddings to a knowledge graph embedding model for complementing predictions. Evaluations on two benchmarks show PDKGC outperforming state-of-the-art fine-tuned language model methods and joint structure-text models. The disentangled prompts are shown to effectively incorporate multi-aspect neighborhood semantics while avoiding full fine-tuning. PDKGC provides an accurate, parameter-efficient approach to knowledge graph completion through targeted prompt-tuning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from incompleteness despite their increasing use in various applications. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing facts based on existing ones. Recent methods utilize pre-trained language models (PLMs) to encode textual information for KGC, but mostly by fine-tuning PLMs which is costly and prone to overfitting. Meanwhile, how to effectively incorporate structural knowledge remains a challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel prompt-tuning based method called PDKGC for KGC using frozen PLMs. It includes two key components:

1) A disentangled graph learner that learns multiple representation components for each entity to encode different semantic aspects based on its neighbors.

2) A hard task prompt reformulating KGC as masked token prediction and a disentangled structure prompt generated from the learned components to incorporate relevant structural knowledge into the PLM. 

After encoding by the frozen PLM, PDKGC has two predictors - a textual one directly predicting entities based on the output vector of the masked token, and a structural one forwarding the output prompts to a KGE model for prediction. Their combination leads to more comprehensive results.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes prompt-tuning for KGC to reduce training costs and overfitting risks of fine-tuning PLMs.
- Designs a hard task prompt to adapt KGC to PLMs' pre-training objectives. 
- Learns disentangled entity representations and generates structure prompts to enable fine-grained fusion of textual and structural knowledge using PLMs' self-attention.
- Builds two complementary predictors based on structure-enhanced text encoding and text-enhanced structure encoding for entity prediction.

Experiments show PDKGC often outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks. The effectiveness of its components is also verified.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new knowledge graph completion (KGC) method called PDKGC, which is based on prompt tuning of pre-trained language models (PLMs). 

2. It introduces two key components: (i) a hard task prompt that reformulates KGC as a masked token prediction task similar to the pre-training objective of PLMs, and (ii) a disentangled structure prompt that incorporates relevant structural information into the PLMs using disentangled graph representations.

3. Through the combination of the hard task prompt and disentangled structure prompt, PDKGC is able to effectively utilize both textual and structural knowledge for KGC using a single frozen PLM.

4. It designs two predictors - a textual predictor and a structural predictor that complement each other and can be ensembled for comprehensive prediction.

5. Experiments show PDKGC achieves new state-of-the-art results on two popular KGC benchmarks compared to previous methods based on fine-tuned PLMs, structure-based methods, and joint methods. The key components are shown to be effective through ablation studies.

In summary, the main contribution is a new prompt tuning based KGC method that can incorporate both textual and structural knowledge on a frozen PLM for improved performance and efficiency. The introduced prompts and predictors are critical for achieving the superior results.
