# [AMP: Autoregressive Motion Prediction Revisited with Next Token   Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13331)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autoregressive motion prediction aims to predict the future states of objects in a step-by-step manner, where each predicted timestep is conditioned on previous predictions. This fits human intuition of moving based on continuous reactions. However, state-of-the-art methods assume future timesteps are independent given past observations, due to difficulties in optimization and capturing long-term dependencies with RNNs/CVAEs. This simplification hinders performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an autoregressive model named AMP that adopts a GPT-style next token prediction framework. Both input observations and output future states are represented as tokens in a unified ego-centric space. To capture complex spatial, temporal and semantic relationships in driving scenes, AMP employs:

1) Factorized attention with different neighbors 

2) Relative position encodings like RoPE to capture temporal relativity 

3) Encoding of transformations between coordinate systems for spatial relativity

A multi-modal detokenizer then produces multiple future trajectories based on predicted intentions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes an autoregressive prediction paradigm for motion forecasting based on next token prediction 

- Unifies input and output representations for better utilization of all sequence information

- Employs tailored designs like factorized attention and specialized relative position encodings to capture driving scene priors

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on Waymo Open Motion and Interaction datasets, outperforming other recent autoregressive methods like MotionLM and StateTransformer.

- Helps narrow the performance gap between autoregressive and independent prediction in motion forecasting

In summary, the paper presents an autoregressive model for motion prediction that unifies input-output representations and employs customized designs for driving scenes. It advances the state-of-the-art for autoregressive motion forecasting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an autoregressive motion prediction method called AMP that unifies the input and output representations into tokens in an ego-centric coordinate system and applies factorized attention mechanisms with tailored position encodings to capture the complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations in driving scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes an autoregressive prediction paradigm for motion forecasting where the inputs and outputs are unified into the same representation space. This allows the model to fully utilize the information of the whole sequence. 

2. It designs different attention mechanisms and relative position encodings tailored for the complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations among elements in the driving scene. For example, using different tokenizers and attention networks for maps and agents, using RoPE for temporal relativity, and encoding transformations between coordinate systems for spatial relativity.

3. The proposed model AMP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably, it outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods like MotionLM and StateTransformer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new autoregressive prediction approach for motion forecasting, along with tailored designs for capturing relations in driving scenes, which leads to state-of-the-art performance.

The paper proposes an autoregressive motion prediction approach called AMP based on next token prediction, similar to GPT models in NLP. It unifies the input and output representations into a shared ego-centric coordinate space and uses relative position encodings and factorized attention mechanisms to capture the complex spatial-temporal-semantic relationships between elements in driving scenes. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion benchmark for autonomous driving motion forecasting.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper adopts a long-term plus short-term prediction design in the Multi-Modal Detokenizer module. What is the intuition behind this? Have the authors experimented with other ways to decompose the trajectory generation, such as modeling acceleration versus position? 

2. The relative position encodings seem crucial for capturing spatial-temporal relations in this heterogeneous prediction space. Have the authors experimented with learnable position encodings versus the adopted Fourier encoding? What were the tradeoffs?  

3. The paper uses weighted averaging to fuse the long-term and short-term trajectory predictions during inference. What other fusion approaches did the authors explore? Why was weighted averaging optimal?

4. What motivated the decision to adopt three separate attention mechanisms in the Future Decoder instead of a single unified attention? Was a unified attention mechanism experimented with? How did it compare?

5. batch norm statistics are frozen halfway through training to stabilize optimization. Why does this help? Have other regularization techniques been explored to mitigate optimization difficulties? 

6. The ablation studies show that using non-static non-focal agents during training improves performance, unlike prior work. What is the insight here? Does this imply something fundamental about the autoregressive formulation?

7. The short-term intention prediction branch provides beneficial intermediate supervision. Have the authors considered incorporating more prediction losses at different timescales as auxiliary tasks to further assist learning?

8. How sensitive is performance to the discretization parameters - number of tokens per time interval, placement of interval divisions, etc? Is there an optimal granularity of discretization?

9. The model architecture has separate components for agents versus map elements. Have the authors experimented with a unified representation? What were the challenges?

10. How does the inference cost scale with the number of predicted modes and sequence length? What is the bottleneck if aiming to scale to much longer prediction horizons?
