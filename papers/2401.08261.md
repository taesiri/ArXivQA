# [Probabilistically Robust Watermarking of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08261)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Probabilistically Robust Watermarking of Neural Networks":

Problem:
- Deep learning models are being widely used in commercial settings and there is interest in protecting their intellectual property from theft. However, existing watermarking techniques for neural networks are susceptible to model stealing attacks like distillation, fine-tuning, etc that remove the watermarks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach that is robust to model stealing attacks. 
- Key ideas:
    - Construct a parametric set of "proxy models" that mimic potential stolen model copies of the source model
    - Generate trigger set candidates using hold-out data 
    - Verify if trigger set candidates are assigned the same class by multiple sampled proxy models 
    - The verified trigger set has high probability of being transferable from source model to potential stolen copies

Main Contributions:
- Introduce a probabilistic framework to make trigger-set based watermarks more resistant to stealing attacks
- Derive probability of trigger set transferability between source model and proxy models
- Experimentally demonstrate trigger set transferability even when stolen model is very different from proxy models
- Evaluated on CIFAR and outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking techniques against distillation, fine-tuning, etc.
- Model-agnostic approach that doesn't modify source model training or limit trigger set size

In summary, the paper presents a novel and robust trigger set-based watermarking technique for neural networks that verifies trigger sets on proxy models. It is shown to outperform prior arts against model stealing attacks without affecting source model performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach that generates transferable trigger sets with high probability to confirm model ownership against black-box model stealing attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach for deep learning models that demonstrates resilience against functionality stealing attacks, particularly those involving extraction and distillation. The key ideas are:

1) Computing a parametric set of proxy models that mimics potential stolen copies of the source model. 

2) Generating candidate trigger sets and verifying them by checking if a sample of proxy models assign the trigger set samples to the same classes as the source model. This aims to ensure the trigger set will transfer to stolen copies. 

3) Showing experimentally that even if a stolen model does not belong to the proxy set, the verified trigger set remains transferable with high accuracy.

4) Evaluating the approach on multiple benchmarks and showing it outperforms current state-of-the-art watermarking techniques against various model stealing attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel, model-agnostic watermarking approach that produces trigger sets resilient to functionality stealing, without needing additional model training or limiting the trigger set size.

The paper focuses on enhancing the robustness of trigger set-based watermarking techniques against model stealing attacks like knowledge distillation. It proposes using a parametric set of proxy models that mimic potential stolen models, and verifying a trigger set based on agreement in the predictions of these proxy models. The goal is to generate a trigger set that is transferable from the source model to potential stolen models with high probability. Key concepts include the parametric proxy model set, common set of predictions, and probabilistic verification of trigger set transferability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the parametric set of proxy models $\mathcal{B}_{\delta, \tau}(f)$ help enhance the robustness of trigger set-based watermarks against model stealing attacks? What assumptions does this approach make?

2. Explain the procedure for computing the candidates for the trigger set $\mathcal{D}_t$. How does it exploit the convex combinations of pairs of points from the hold-out dataset?

3. What is the key idea behind the trigger set verification procedure using multiple sampled proxy models? How does this enhance transferability to potential stolen models? 

4. Analyze the probability that a given trigger set candidate belongs to the common set $\mathcal{S}(f, \delta, \tau)$. How does the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval help estimate this?

5. Does the parametric proxy model set guarantee inclusion of all potential stolen models? If not, explain why the verified trigger sets still demonstrate high transferability in experiments.

6. Discuss the effect of parameters $m$ and $\delta$ of the proxy model set on both transferability of the trigger set and computation time. What trade-off exists here? 

7. Compare the threat models considered in this work to other state-of-the-art watermarking techniques. What assumptions are made about the adversary's knowledge?

8. How could the verification procedure be adapted to provide guarantees that benign models are not wrongly detected as stolen? What are the challenges associated with this?

9. What modifications would be required to apply this watermarking approach to other modalities like text or speech? 

10. Beyond model stealing attacks, how can the proposed technique be extended to handle other threats like model extraction, inversion, and poisoning attacks?
