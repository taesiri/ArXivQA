# [Graph-based Clustering for Detecting Semantic Change Across Time and   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Detecting semantic change, i.e. changes in word meanings over time, is an important task in computational linguistics. 
- Recent works rely on contextualized word embeddings (e.g. BERT) and clustering methods, but struggle to effectively capture nuanced changes in word senses, especially low-frequency senses.
- They also cannot track inter-language semantic changes to study meaning divergence across languages. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a graph-based clustering approach that leverages contextualized embeddings to capture the evolution of each word sense across both time and languages.

- It represents word meanings using semantic-tree graphs with nodes as centroids of sense clusters. Edges connect centroids to their nearest neighbors.

- It introduces temporal dynamic graphs to track intra-language semantic change. Spatial dynamic graphs are used to connect translations across languages and study inter-language divergence.

- A novel neighbor-based distance metric is proposed to accurately quantify similarities between sense clusters over time and languages. 

- A customized clustering method is designed to effectively capture low-frequency word senses.

Main Contributions:
- The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SemEval binary classification task for detecting semantic change across four languages. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of key components.

- It excels as a visualization tool for exploratory analysis, showcasing both intra- and inter-language semantic changes, including nuanced changes in low-frequency senses.

- It enables studying if related words across languages undergo consistent or divergent semantic changes over time.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in effectively leveraging contextualized embeddings for semantic change detection through innovative graph-based modeling and clustering. The interpretability of the approach also enables in-depth exploratory linguistic analyses.
