# [DiffMorph: Text-less Image Morphing with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called "DiffMorph" for generating customized images by morphing concepts from an initial image and user-provided sketches, without needing text prompts. 

Problem:
- Existing text-to-image models require careful prompt engineering to generate customized images of a specific concept. 
- Prior work on model customization requires multiple images per concept which is cumbersome. 
- There is a lack of artistic control in these models.

Proposed Solution:
- DiffMorph takes an initial image and sketch(es) as input and determines their semantic classes using CLIP. 
- A relation is generated between classes using ConceptNet to create the text prompt.
- A sketch-to-image module called ConditionFlow is proposed to convert sketches into images.
- The pre-trained Stable Diffusion model is fine-tuned with input images in a controlled manner to reconstruct them. This allows morphing multiple concepts while preventing overfitting.
- Image generation is conditioned on the input images and relation between them rather than text prompts.

Main Contributions:
- ConditionFlow model to accurately convert sketches into images.
- Controlled fine-tuning approach to customize model with just 1 image per concept.
- Method to morph multiple concepts from images and sketches without text prompts.
- Artistic control over image generation process through sketch-based interaction.

The proposed sketch-based interaction for image customization auments the artistic flexibility. The customized image generation technique also reduces the overfitting issue prevalent in other state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of DiffMorph over existing approaches.
