# [Neural Vocoder is All You Need for Speech Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14941)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop a speech super-resolution model that can handle flexible input resolutions and high upsampling ratios, and achieve state-of-the-art performance? The key ideas presented in the paper to address this question are:- Using a two-stage model consisting of mel spectrogram prediction and vocoder synthesis, rather than direct waveform generation. This makes the problem more tractable.- Operating on mel spectrogram rather than linear spectrogram. The log frequency scaling and lower dimensions help with arbitrary input bandwidths and high upsampling ratios. - Leveraging the prior knowledge about speech structures contained in pretrained neural vocoders. This is shown to significantly improve performance.- Evaluating on a range of input sampling rates from 2kHz to 32kHz and target sampling rate of 44.1kHz. This tests generalization over flexible input resolutions and upsampling ratios up to 22.05x.The central hypothesis seems to be that this two-stage vocoder-based approach will be able to achieve state-of-the-art speech super-resolution performance across a variety of input settings, which is demonstrated empirically in the paper.
