# [Multi-Model 3D Registration: Finding Multiple Moving Objects in   Cluttered Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10865)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the problem of multi-model 3D registration, where the goal is to simultaneously recover the motion (rotations and translations) of multiple objects given two point clouds. This is more challenging than standard 3D registration which estimates the motion of a single object. It arises in robotics applications where a robot observes a dynamic scene with multiple moving objects and static background and wants to estimate its own motion as well as the motion of the other objects.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach to solve this problem. The key idea is to iteratively alternate between assigning each point correspondence to one of the objects (E-step) and estimating the motion for each object based on the current assignments (M-step). No prior knowledge about the number of objects is needed. The assignments are based on the likelihood of each point fitting the current motion estimate for each object. Additional constraints can be added to enforce that distant objects are distinct even if exhibiting similar motion.

Contributions:
1) Formulation of the multi-model 3D registration problem and a practical EM approach to solve it.

2) Theoretical analysis showing that under suitable initialization conditions, the EM approach is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth motions.

3) Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach for table-top scenes as well as large driving datasets. The method works well when combined with state of the art scene flow techniques for establishing correspondences.

In summary, the paper provides a mathematically grounded method for jointly estimating ego-motion and motions of other objects for dynamic scene understanding tasks in robotics. The convergence guarantees and strong empirical results showcase its applicability.
