# [NPHardEval4V: A Dynamic Reasoning Benchmark of Multimodal Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is important for understanding their capabilities and guiding further development. However, existing benchmarks have limitations:
    - Do not isolate reasoning ability from other factors like recognition and instruction following
    - Are static, increasing risk of overfitting

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce NPHardEval4V, a dynamic benchmark to evaluate pure reasoning abilities of MLLMs
    - Built by converting textual descriptions in NPHardEval problems to visual representations
    - Comprises questions across polynomial time, NP-complete and NP-hard complexity classes
    - Will be updated monthly to prevent overfitting

Key Contributions:
- Disentangles reasoning ability from recognition and instruction following through specialized metrics 
- Compares reasoning performance of various MLLMs and highlights their limitations compared to LLMs
- Investigates impact of visual, text and combined prompts on MLLMs' reasoning
- Provides insights into current capabilities of MLLMs and guides advancement of reasoning abilities
- Addresses gaps in existing benchmarks by using computational complexity to systematically evaluate reasoning
- Dynamic updating mechanism ensures continued relevance and prevents overfitting

In summary, this paper introduces a rigorous, dynamic benchmark called NPHardEval4V to isolate and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs across different complexity classes. By disentangling reasoning from other factors and regularly updating the benchmark, it aims to provide authentic assessments to understand current MLLMs and steer progress in developing enhanced reasoning abilities.
