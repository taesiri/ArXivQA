# [GraphInstruct: Empowering Large Language Models with Graph Understanding   and Reasoning Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) lack the capability to truly understand graph-structured data, which limits their ability to perform reasoning tasks involving graphs. This is a crucial capability needed to advance AI's general intelligence. 

- Prior work has explored enhancing LLMs using graph neural networks or evaluating them on simple graph tasks, but the problem remains largely unsolved and most models still struggle on complex graph reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce GraphInstruct, a new benchmark with 21 diverse graph reasoning tasks and detailed reasoning chains as supervision.

- They fine-tune an LLM called GraphLM on this benchmark. GraphLM demonstrates significantly improved graph understanding over the base LLM, with accuracy rivaling strong models like GPT-3.5 on many tasks.

- To further improve reasoning ability, they propose GraphLM+ which utilizes intermediate reasoning supervision and a label masking scheme during training. Experiments show GraphLM+ can provide correct reasoning chains at a far higher rate.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive graph reasoning benchmark with diverse tasks, graph generation pipelines and reasoning chains

- GraphLM model that achieves state-of-the-art graph understanding through specialized fine-tuning 

- GraphLM+ model with enhanced graph reasoning capability thanks to intermediate supervision and masking scheme

- Analysis of model performance confirming improved generalization to new graphs, descriptions and tasks

In summary, this paper makes important progress towards overcoming the limitations of LLMs on graph data through a new benchmark and model training strategies. The GraphLM and GraphLM+ showcase the potential to unlock stronger relational reasoning in large language models.
