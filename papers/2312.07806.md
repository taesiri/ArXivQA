# [Contextually Affinitive Neighborhood Refinery for Deep Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Previous works in deep clustering have shown the importance of grouping semantically similar instances. One effective way to achieve this is by promoting the semantic structure preserved by neighborhood consistency. However, the samples in the local neighborhood may be limited due to their close proximity, which may not provide substantial and diverse supervision signals. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Contextually Affinitive (ConAff) Neighborhood Refinery framework (CoNR) to address this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Employ an efficient online re-ranking process to mine more informative neighbors in a Contextually Affinitive Neighborhood. This is inspired by image retrieval techniques and builds a contextual k-NN graph to inject contextual information into the feature space. Message passing is then used to obtain contextually refined features to retrieve the ConAff neighborhood.

2) Encourage cross-view neighborhood consistency between the ConAff neighborhood and the query sample's augmented view. This provides more informative and reliable neighbors for training the network.

3) Propose a progressively relaxed boundary filtering strategy to handle intrinsic neighborhood noises near cluster boundaries. This filters out boundary samples in a self-paced manner and gradually involves more samples to avoid noise accumulation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of Contextually Affinitive Neighborhood to excavate more informative neighbors for deep clustering.
- Cross-view neighborhood consistency between ConAff neighborhood and augmented views.  
- Progressively relaxed boundary filtering strategy to handle intrinsic neighborhood noises.
- Consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.
- Simple and effective framework that can be integrated into existing SSL methods.

In summary, the paper presents an effective deep clustering approach by refining the neighborhood in a contextually affinitive space and using cross-view neighborhood consistency and boundary filtering strategies. The method achieves new state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks.
