# [GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Training large language models (LLMs) is very memory intensive, not just due to the large number of parameters but also due to the memory needed to store gradients and optimizer states during training. For example, training a 7B parameter LLaMA model requires at least 58GB memory with a single batch size. This makes training infeasible even on high-end GPUs. Existing methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce memory usage by limiting the number of trainable parameters but underperform compared to full-rank training.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Gradient Low-Rank Projection (\lowrank), a strategy that allows full-parameter learning while being more memory efficient than LoRA. The key idea is that while weight matrices may not be low-rank, the gradient matrix has an inherent low-rank structure during training. \lowrank{} computes projection matrices $P$ and $Q$ to project the full gradient $G$ into a low-rank version $P^\top G Q$. Since optimizer states rely only on this low-rank gradient, substantial memory savings can be achieved. $P$ and $Q$ are refreshed periodically to allow learning across multiple low-rank subspaces over time.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and formally prove the low-rank property of gradients in common network architectures 
- Propose the \lowrank algorithm that projects gradients to low-rank in a memory-efficient way, while allowing full parameter updates
- Achieve up to 65.5\% reduction in optimizer memory and comparable performance to full-rank training when pre-training LLMs
- Enable, for the first time, pre-training a 7B LLaMA model on a single 24GB GPU without any model/data parallelism or memory offloading techniques
- Show strong performance in fine-tuning GLUE tasks, outperforming prior methods like LoRA

The method is simple to implement, works with various optimizers, has few sensitive hyperparameters, and serves as an efficient full-stack solution for memory-constrained LLM training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a memory-efficient training strategy for large language models that projects gradients to a low-rank space to reduce memory footprint while allowing full-parameter learning and maintaining efficiency and performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Gradient Low-Rank Projection (\lowrank), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA. \lowrank{} reduces memory usage by projecting gradients to low-rank forms during training, while still allowing optimization over the full parameter space. Key benefits shown in the paper include:

- Reducing optimizer memory usage by up to 65.5% during pre-training of large language models, with comparable performance to baseline methods. This enables pre-training a 7B parameter model on a single 24GB GPU.

- Achieving better fine-tuning performance than LoRA on GLUE tasks, with less memory footprint. 

- Providing theoretical analysis on the low-rank property of gradients during training and the convergence guarantee of the proposed \lowrank{} algorithm.

- Demonstrating that \lowrank{} can flexibly combine with other memory reduction techniques like 8-bit optimizers and per-layer updates.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and analyzing the \lowrank{} algorithm for efficient large language model training, with empirical demonstrations on both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios.

The main focus of the paper seems to be proposing a new training strategy called "Gradient Low-Rank Projection" (\lowrank) that can reduce the memory usage during pre-training and fine-tuning of large language models, while maintaining performance. The key ideas include projecting gradient matrices into a low-rank form to reduce optimizer memory, allowing composition of multiple low-rank subspaces, and compatibility with techniques like 8-bit optimizers and per-layer updates. Experiments demonstrate memory savings on the order of 60\% for pre-training models up to 7 billion parameters, and the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on a single 24GB GPU for the first time, without additional memory optimizations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that the gradient matrix becomes low-rank during training. What theoretical justification is provided for this claim? Can you explain the assumptions needed and sketch a proof?

2. How exactly does GaLore (Gradient Low-rank Projection) work? Explain the key steps of computing the low-rank gradient projection and updating the weights. What are the additional hyper-parameters it introduces?

3. How does GaLore differ from existing low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA? What are the key differences in how they parameterize and update the weights during training?

4. The paper discusses allowing GaLore to switch across multiple low-rank subspaces during training. Why is this important? How is the frequency of subspace changes determined? What happens with too frequent or too infrequent changes?

5. Explain how GaLore is combined with existing techniques like 8-bit optimizers and per-layer weight updates to further reduce memory. How do these combinations work?

6. What convergence guarantees does the paper provide for GaLore? Explain the assumptions needed and sketch a proof of the convergence result. What do the key quantities in the bound represent?

7. How is the low-rank projection matrix $P$ set in practice using SVD? Why does this work well empirically? Does the theory provide any justification?

8. How does GaLore enable training large 7B models on consumer GPUs with 24 GB memory for the first time? Quantify the memory savings over baselines.

9. What additional experiments could be done to further evaluate GaLore? For example, applying it to other models like Vision Transformers or comparing with more baselines.

10. What are some limitations of GaLore and open problems for future work? Can the memory savings be improved further? How can training efficiency be enhanced?
