# [Decentralized and Equitable Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the decentralized optimal transport (D-OT) and decentralized equitable optimal transport (DE-OT) problems. In D-OT, multiple agents aim to cooperatively design an optimal transportation plan to move mass between two distributions, where each agent only has access to one column of the cost matrix. In DE-OT, each agent has its own private cost matrix and the goal is to design an equitable transportation plan that balances costs across agents.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows that D-OT and DE-OT can be formulated as distributed constrained optimization problems. This allows existing algorithms for such problems to be applied.

- For D-OT, the paper proposes using an inexact decentralized ADMM method that achieves an iteration complexity of O(1/ε), matching centralized methods. 

- For DE-OT, the proposed decentralized ADMM method improves upon existing centralized methods, achieving an iteration complexity of O(1/ε) versus O(1/ε2) for centralized approaches. Additionally, the algorithm guarantees the equitable constraint is satisfied at a rate of O(1/k).

Main Contributions:
- First decentralized formulation and algorithms for D-OT and DE-OT problems.

- Decentralized algorithm for D-OT matches performance of centralized methods.

- Decentralized algorithm for DE-OT improves upon centralized methods in terms of iteration complexity and satisfying equitable constraint.

- Demonstrates reformulating decentralized OT problems as distributed constrained optimizations allows leveraging existing algorithms while providing performance guarantees.

In summary, the paper provides decentralized methods for OT and EOT that match or improve upon centralized approaches and highlights how reformulating as distributed constrained optimization enables leveraging existing optimization algorithms.
