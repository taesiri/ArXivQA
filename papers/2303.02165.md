# [DeepMAD: Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep Convolutional Neural   Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02165)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is how to design high-performance convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in a principled and efficient way, without relying heavily on extensive architecture search or manually tuning. The key ideas proposed are:1) Model the CNN architecture design problem as a constrained mathematical optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the information entropy of the network while constraining the "effectiveness" to prevent the network from being too deep.2) The effectiveness is defined based on the depth-to-width aspect ratio, controlling the balance between network expressiveness and trainability. 3) Solve this mathematical programming (MP) problem efficiently on CPU to obtain an optimized CNN architecture.4) Validate the proposed "Mathematical Architecture Design" (DeepMAD) framework on image classification, showing it can design CNNs that outperform modern CNNs and Vision Transformers with similar complexity.In summary, the core hypothesis is that by formulating CNN architecture design as a constrained mathematical optimization problem based on information theory and deep learning principles, one can automate the design of high-performance CNNs without extensive architecture search or manual tuning. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
