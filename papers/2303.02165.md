# [DeepMAD: Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep Convolutional Neural   Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02165)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is how to design high-performance convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in a principled and efficient way, without relying heavily on extensive architecture search or manually tuning. The key ideas proposed are:1) Model the CNN architecture design problem as a constrained mathematical optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the information entropy of the network while constraining the "effectiveness" to prevent the network from being too deep.2) The effectiveness is defined based on the depth-to-width aspect ratio, controlling the balance between network expressiveness and trainability. 3) Solve this mathematical programming (MP) problem efficiently on CPU to obtain an optimized CNN architecture.4) Validate the proposed "Mathematical Architecture Design" (DeepMAD) framework on image classification, showing it can design CNNs that outperform modern CNNs and Vision Transformers with similar complexity.In summary, the core hypothesis is that by formulating CNN architecture design as a constrained mathematical optimization problem based on information theory and deep learning principles, one can automate the design of high-performance CNNs without extensive architecture search or manual tuning. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new framework called Mathematical Architecture Design (MAD) for designing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key ideas are:- They model a CNN as an information processing system and derive expressions to calculate its entropy, which measures the network's expressiveness or representation power. - They propose a concept called "effectiveness" to constrain the network depth, preventing it from becoming too deep which would hinder information propagation and make training difficult. The effectiveness is defined using the depth-to-width ratio.- They formulate a mathematical optimization problem to maximize entropy (expressiveness) subject to the effectiveness constraint and hardware resource constraints. Solving this results in optimized CNN architectures.- They demonstrate their framework on image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and action recognition tasks. The CNNs designed by their method achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to modern CNNs and Vision Transformers, using only conventional convolution layers.In summary, the key novelty is introducing the ideas of mathematically modeling entropy and constraining effectiveness to enable optimizing CNN architectures directly through mathematical optimization, without needing training or Neural Architecture Search. The effectiveness of this theory-driven design paradigm is shown across multiple vision tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:This paper proposes a mathematical framework called DeepMAD to optimize CNN architectures by maximizing entropy under effectiveness constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to or better than ViT models.
