## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper on Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation:

Problem:
Existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are trained on fixed datasets and fail to adapt when introduced to new environments without forgetting past knowledge (catastrophic forgetting). This limitation makes it difficult to develop VLN agents that can operate in the dynamic real world. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm to train and evaluate VLN agents on their ability to learn new scene domains sequentially while retaining knowledge of past ones. Two CVLN datasets are proposed: CVLN-I based on initial navigation instructions and CVLN-D based on dialogue. 

The paper also proposes two novel rehearsal-based methods to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in CVLN:
1) Perplexity Replay (PerpR): Prioritizes replays of episodes with high action perplexity, indicating challenges for the agent.
2) Episodic Self-Replay (ESR): Replays previously predicted action distributions to preserve learned behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of CVLN paradigm and datasets (CVLN-I and CVLN-D) to evaluate continual learning for VLN agents
- Proposal of two new rehearsal-based methods (PerpR and ESR) to enhance continual learning in CVLN
- Demonstration through experiments that PerpR and ESR outperform existing continual learning approaches on CVLN tasks

The paper makes significant contributions towards developing VLN agents that can operate in the real world by introducing continual learning capabilities lacking in current VLN research. The CVLN paradigm, datasets, and proposed methods lay strong foundations for future works on continual VLN agents.
