# [Self-Labeling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) involves scheduling a set of jobs onto a set of machines, where each job has a specific order in which it must be processed on the machines. The goal is to minimize the makespan (total time to complete all jobs). Constructive heuristics like priority dispatching rules (PDRs) are commonly used but have limitations in solution quality. Recent machine learning approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise but can be complex to implement and tune. Supervised learning relies on expensive optimal solutions. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a self-supervised training strategy to train a generative Pointer Network (PN) model for the JSP without needing optimal solutions. The key ideas are:

1) Generate multiple parallel solutions for an instance and use the one with minimum makespan as a pseudo-label to update the model. 

2) The PN model encodes the JSP instance graph into operation embeddings. The decoder autoregressively constructs a solution by sequentially selecting a job to schedule based on operation embeddings, partial solution state and job completion levels.

3) By iteratively training on random instances this way, the model learns to construct better solutions guided only by internally comparing generated solutions.

Contributions:

1) A self-labeling training strategy that exploits a model's ability to generate multiple solutions and internal objective comparison to drive learning. Applicable to other combinatorial optimization problems.

2) A Pointer Network model for the JSP that when trained with this strategy, achieves state-of-the-art results compared topriority rules, RL techniques and mixed integer programming solvers on standard benchmarks.

The simplicity yet effectiveness of this self-supervised approach on a complex problem like JSP highlights its potential. Future work includes testing on other problems and using the model to enhance existing techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised training strategy for pointer networks that generates multiple solutions for a job shop scheduling problem instance and uses the one with the minimum makespan as a pseudo-label to train the model, outperforming constructive heuristics and reinforcement learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel Self-Labeling training strategy for generative models applied to combinatorial optimization problems. This strategy relies only on model-generated solutions and the problem's objective for supervision, removing the need for expansive optimal solutions during training.

2) Presenting a Pointer Network architecture that is trained with the proposed Self-Labeling strategy and generates high-quality solutions for the Job Shop Scheduling problem. When tested on two popular benchmarks, this model outperforms priority dispatching rules, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches, and even beats exact methods on larger instances.

So in summary, the key contributions are an effective self-supervised training methodology and a pointer network model for the JSP that leverages this methodology to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The simplicity yet effectiveness of the overall approach is noteworthy.

The paper proposes a self-supervised training strategy for a pointer network to solve the job shop scheduling problem by minimizing the makespan. The key ideas are using the model to generate multiple solutions, selecting the best one as a pseudo-label for self-supervision, and iteratively training the model without expensive optimality information. The model outperforms several constructive heuristics and reinforcement learning techniques.
