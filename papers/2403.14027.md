# [EcoSense: Energy-Efficient Intelligent Sensing for In-Shore Ship   Detection through Edge-Cloud Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Inshore marine object detection (IMOD) using RGB cameras is challenging due to the high similarity in shape and appearance between different types of ships. Additionally, deploying IMOD systems involving numerous sensors along vast coastlines presents difficulties related to computational resource constraints on edge devices. Existing solutions using fully centralized or distributed frameworks have limitations in accuracy, bandwidth requirements or energy efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an edge-cloud collaborative sensing framework that divides IMOD into object localization on edge devices followed by fine-grained classification on either the edge or cloud based on estimated difficulty. A low-power front-end model handles localization, difficulty estimation and “easy” classification. A back-end transformer+GCN model on the cloud specializes in detailed classification of “hard” samples.  

Key Contributions:
- Novel framework balancing performance and efficiency via collaborative edge-cloud processing 
- Lightweight front-end network with attention mechanisms for localization and coarse classification
- Transformer+GCN back-end network with background suppression for fine-grained classification  
- Significantly reduced resource usage: 95.43% less data transmission and 72.7% lower energy versus centralized approach
- Superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods on SeaShips (+4.3% mAP) and SMD-Plus (+1.9% mAP)
- Validated across embedded platforms and in real-world drone testing showing practical deployability

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in algorithm design, systems optimization and hardware implementation to address key technology gaps in practical IMOD based on the analysis of challenges involved.
