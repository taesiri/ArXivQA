# [SCStory: Self-supervised and Continual Online Story Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03725)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online news articles are being massively published in real-time through online platforms. Organizing them into stories (sets of articles around an event with a unique theme) is beneficial for many applications like summarization and recommendation. 
- Existing story discovery methods have limitations in capturing the diversified and evolving context of news streams. They use static embeddings based on keywords statistics which are too short to capture the nuanced semantics. The embedded representations also do not adapt to the changing distributions of articles over time as new events occur.

Proposed Solution - SCStory:
- Presents a framework for Self-supervised and Continual online Story discovery from news article streams.
- Employs a hierarchical approach - first gets sentence embeddings from a pretrained sentence encoder, then learns lightweight story-indicative article embeddings that focus on correlations between story-relevant sentences.
- New articles are incrementally clustered to existing or new stories based on representation similarity scores.
- The article encoder is continuously updated via contrastive learning on confident samples to make it adaptive to evolving articles and discovered stories.

Key Contributions:
- A novel idea of story-indicative adaptive modeling of news streams to capture only the story-relevant information from diverse and evolving articles.
- A lightweight yet effective article encoder trained by self-supervised contrastive learning with confidence-aware memory replay and prioritized augmentation.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for online story discovery on real datasets. Enables better understanding of emerging stories.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative streaming framework that leverages self-supervision for robust story discovery from textual news streams in an unsupervised manner. By focusing on story-relevant semantics, it achieves superior accuracy compared to prior arts.
