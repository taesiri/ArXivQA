# [On Convergence of Federated Averaging Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05120v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:Can we develop a unified algorithm with convergence guarantees for sampling from a posterior distribution in federated learning settings?The key points are:- The paper proposes using stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods like stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) for Bayesian posterior inference in federated learning. This allows going beyond just point estimates to quantify uncertainty.- They adapt the optimization-based federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to develop a federated averaging Langevin dynamics (FA-LD) algorithm for distributed Bayesian posterior inference.- The main research question is whether they can analyze the convergence guarantees theoretically for FA-LD. Previous work has analyzed convergence for optimization objectives, but analyzing convergence for sampling from distributions in federated settings is still an open problem.- The paper provides a novel non-asymptotic convergence analysis of FA-LD for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions in federated settings. The analysis sheds light on how factors like noise, heterogeneity, and learning rates affect convergence.- Overall, the central research contribution is developing and analyzing FA-LD as a unified algorithm with convergence guarantees for Bayesian posterior inference via sampling in federated learning settings. The analysis helps provide guidance on how to optimally tune the algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a federated averaging Langevin algorithm (FA-LD) for uncertainty quantification and mean prediction with distributed clients. This generalizes beyond normal posterior distributions to consider a wider class of models.2. Developing theoretical guarantees for the convergence of FA-LD in strongly convex scenarios with non-i.i.d. data. The analysis studies how factors like data heterogeneity, injected noise, and varying learning rates affect convergence. 3. Examining the use of independent and correlated noise over clients in FA-LD. It is shown that the posterior distribution can always be approximated in Wasserstein-2 distance, but there is a tradeoff between federation and communication cost that is not affected by the injected noise.4. Showing convergence results for FA-LD based on different averaging schemes with only partial device updates available. An additional bias is discovered that does not decay to zero in this case.5. Providing differential privacy guarantees that shed light on the tradeoff between privacy, accuracy, and communication costs.In summary, the main contributions are proposing the FA-LD algorithm, analyzing its convergence theoretically, and studying tradeoffs related to noise injection, partial devices, and privacy for distributed Bayesian posterior approximation.
