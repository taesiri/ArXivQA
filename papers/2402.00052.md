# [Zero-shot Sequential Neuro-symbolic Reasoning for Automatically   Generating Architecture Schematic Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to address the challenge of automatically generating architecture schematic designs for multifamily apartment buildings. Such schematic designs encompass high-level decisions on aspects like building footprint, apartment unit mixes, amenities, and layouts. Making these interdependent decisions requires balancing creative expertise with technical feasibility, posing difficulties for automation.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel "sequential neuro-symbolic reasoning" approach that combines the strengths of generative AI (referred to as "neuro reasoning") and mathematical optimization (called "symbolic reasoning"). It breaks down the problem into two sequential steps:

1. Building Plan Generation: Decide building footprint, number of floors, distribution of apartment units, and communal amenities by using neuro reasoning to define objectives and constraints, and symbolic reasoning to find optimal solutions. 

2. Floor Plan Generation: Decide placement and dimensions of rooms on each floor through adjacency specifications from neuro reasoning, optimized into layouts by symbolic reasoning.

Additionally, feedback loops are introduced between the neuro and symbolic components to align objectives and ensure feasibility at each stage.

Key Contributions:
1) A new technique for large-scale creative design by integrating neuro and symbolic reasoning in a sequential manner, emulating human architectural workflow. 

2) Shifting the role of symbolic solvers from optimizing heuristics to satisfying constraints and objectives set by the AI model itself.

3) Feedback loops to bridge information gaps between the neural and symbolic steps for improved coherence.

The method is validated by generating building designs for hypothetical lots and comparing to real buildings. Results demonstrate ability to produce varied designs exhibiting location-specific trends.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel automated system for generating architecture schematic designs by combining generative AI and mathematical program solvers in a sequential neuro-symbolic reasoning approach to address the reliance on expert insights and technical challenges.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel sequential neuro-symbolic reasoning approach for automatically generating architecture schematic designs. Specifically:

1) To address the large-scale and interconnected nature of design decisions in architectural schematic design, the paper proposes a solution inspired by traditional design principles of sequential decision-making. This breaks down the problem into a series of decisions from high-level to low-level.

2) The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach where in each step, a large language model (the "neuro" component) generates specifications and constraints, and a mathematical program solver (the "symbolic" component) finds a solution conforming to those specifications.

3) The paper incorporates feedback loops between the neuro and symbolic components to ensure tight integration and validate the feasibility of the specifications. This includes both neural feedback to adjust high-level decisions based on lower-level solutions, and symbolic feedback to resolve infeasible constraints.

4) The method is evaluated on hypothetical lots and actual apartment buildings, demonstrating its ability to generate valid schematic designs with location-specific variations in building footprints, amenities, and unit mixes. Ablation studies highlight the need for both sequential and neuro-symbolic reasoning.

In summary, the key innovation is in the integration of neuro and symbolic reasoning through a sequential approach with bi-directional feedback loops, enabling the automated generation of architectural designs.
