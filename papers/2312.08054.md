# [Semantic Complete Scene Forecasting from a 4D Dynamic Point Cloud   Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08054)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new task called semantic complete scene forecasting (SCSF) which involves predicting the future complete scene with semantic labels from an input 4D dynamic point cloud sequence. To tackle this challenging problem, the authors present a novel network called SCSFNet which exploits the synergistic relationship between future scene forecasting and semantic scene completion. SCSFNet uses a hybrid geometric representation combining sparse voxels, dense voxels, and implicit fields to enable high-resolution scene forecasting. It also employs attention-based skip connections to aggregate multi-frame observations and introduces auxiliary visibility grids to provide ambient space priors. To evaluate SCSFNet, the authors contribute two large-scale indoor datasets with complete 4D annotations and also test on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SCSFNet, with over 10% mIoU improvements on the SCSF task compared to strong baselines. The results also showcase the mutual benefits between forecasting and completion, proving the value of their joint modeling. Overall, this paper makes notable contributions in 4D scene understanding through the proposal of the SCSF problem and an effective learning-based solution.
