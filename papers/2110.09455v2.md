# [TLDR: Twin Learning for Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09455v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

"Can we borrow from the highly successful learning frameworks of self-supervised representation learning to design dimensionality reduction approaches?"

The paper proposes a new dimensionality reduction method called Twin Learning for Dimensionality Reduction (TLDR) that leverages ideas from recent self-supervised representation learning methods like Barlow Twins. The key hypothesis is that TLDR will be able to learn better low-dimensional representations that preserve local neighborhood structure compared to traditional dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. The paper evaluates this hypothesis through extensive experiments on image and text retrieval tasks.

In summary, the main research question is whether self-supervised learning principles can be adapted to improve dimensionality reduction performance compared to existing unsupervised methods like PCA. The proposed TLDR method is presented as a way to test this hypothesis.
