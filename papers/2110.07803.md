# [Attacking Open-domain Question Answering by Injecting Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07803)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How do question answering (QA) models behave under contradicting contexts that contain a mix of both real and fake/misleading information?

The key aspects are:

- The paper investigates the impact of misinformation/disinformation on QA models by constructing contradicting contexts that mix real information with fake information created both manually (by humans) and automatically (by neural models). 

- The hypothesis seems to be that existing QA models will struggle or be misled when presented with these kinds of contradicting contexts containing misinformation. 

- The paper aims to analyze the vulnerability of QA models to misinformation and propose methods to build more robust QA systems that can handle contradicting contexts.

So in summary, the central research question is investigating and analyzing how QA models perform on contradicting contexts with real + fake information, in order to understand their vulnerability to misinformation and explore ways to improve robustness. The key hypothesis is that current QA models will struggle with such contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

1) Constructing a new dataset called ContraQA, which contains over 10K human-written and model-generated contradicting pairs of contexts based on the SQuAD dataset. 

2) Proposing a model called BART-FG for generating fake contexts by iteratively masking and re-generating constituents in the original context.

3) Analyzing the vulnerability of QA models under contradicting contexts mixed with real and fake information. The results show QA models suffer significant performance drops on ContraQA compared to SQuAD.

4) Proposing a misinformation-aware QA system that integrates question answering and fake context detection, which improves performance under contradicting contexts. 

In summary, the key contribution is creating a new dataset and threat model to analyze the impact of contradicting contexts and misinformation on QA systems, and proposing methods to make QA systems more robust under such conditions. The paper focuses on studying contradicting information that brings conflicting facts to the QA context.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ContraQA, the first large-scale dataset for studying the impact of misinformation on question answering systems, containing over 10K contradicting context pairs written by humans and generated by models, and shows that existing QA systems are vulnerable to such misinformation but can be made more robust by integrating misinformation detection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on studying the impact of misinformation and contradicting contexts on question answering systems. Much prior work has focused on adversarial attacks or robustness in QA, but not through the lens of misinformation. This provides a new perspective on QA robustness.

- The paper introduces a new dataset, ContraQA, containing over 10k examples of contradicting contexts mixed with real and fake information. This is the first dataset of its kind for studying QA under misinformation. Prior work has not looked at contradicting contexts or included both human-written and AI-generated misinformation.

- The proposed BART-FG model for controllably generating fake contexts is novel. It uses constituency parsing and masking to iteratively modify key phrases in the original text. This allows for controlled generation of contradicting information. Other text generation models like GPT-2 don't have this fine-grained control.

- The misinformation-aware QA framework jointly trains a QA model with a fake context detector. This is a new architecture aimed at improving robustness to misinformation. Prior work has not explored joint QA - misinformation detection models. 

- Experiments are comprehensive in evaluating major QA models on ContraQA and analyzing impact of different misinformation types. This provides new insights on where models struggle with contradictions.

Overall, the core ideas around contradicting contexts, new dataset, controlled generation model, and joint QA-detection model offer unique contributions not explored by prior work. The paper carves out a novel problem space at the intersection of QA, misinformation, and robustness. More work is still needed to address these issues in open-domain QA.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Study the problem of QA robustness to misinformation under more realistic open-domain QA settings. The current work focuses on closed-domain QA using a modified version of the SQuAD dataset. The authors suggest extending the research to open-domain QA where retrieving relevant contexts introduces additional challenges.

- Develop more effective countermeasures and defenses for building robust misinformation-aware QA systems. The authors show that integrating misinformation detection can help, but it requires large amounts of labeled in-domain data which may not be feasible. More advanced techniques need to be explored.

- Explore other types of misinformation beyond contradictory information, such as hoaxes, rumors, false propaganda etc. The current work focuses specifically on contradicting contexts, but there are other forms of misinformation that need to be considered. 

- Evaluate the impact of different kinds of misinformation edits, beyond just entity substitutions. The authors mainly consider entity substitutions to create contradictions, but more complex edits could reveal further challenges.

- Study the threat of neural-generated misinformation at scale. The authors argue misinformation can be easily mass-produced using neural models, exacerbating the risks. Defending against neural misinformation needs more attention.

- Release datasets to promote research on robust QA. The authors plan to release their dataset to facilitate progress on this important problem. More datasets could spur further advances.

In summary, the authors argue much more research is needed to handle misinformation in QA, suggesting directions like more complex settings, improved defense techniques, alternate misinformation types, analysis of different edits, contending with neural-generated misinformation, and releasing datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces ContraQA, the first dataset for studying question answering under contradicting contexts mixed with both real and fake information. The dataset contains over 10k human-written and model-generated contradicting context pairs built on top of SQuAD 1.1. The authors propose BART-FG, a novel framework to generate the fake contradicting contexts by iteratively masking and regenerating constituency spans from the original context. Experiments demonstrate that current QA models suffer significant performance drops on ContraQA, revealing their vulnerability to misinformation. To mitigate this threat, the authors build a robust QA system integrating question answering and misinformation detection, which improves performance. However, defending against misinformation remains challenging without sufficient in-domain training data. The authors plan to release ContraQA to spur more research into building robust QA systems that can handle real-world misinformation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset called ContraQA for evaluating question answering systems under contradicting contexts. The dataset is constructed from SQuAD 1.1 by creating fake contradicting versions of the original context paragraphs. Both human annotators and a novel generative model called BART-FG are used to produce the fake contexts. BART-FG iteratively masks and regenerates constituency spans in the original context to create fluent contradicting texts. Experiments show that state-of-the-art QA models suffer significant performance drops on ContraQA compared to clean SQuAD data. Both human-written and BART-FG generated contradicting contexts are challenging, but human edits are subtler and more deceiving. The authors propose integrating question answering with misinformation detection as a defense. A detector trained on sufficient labeled real/fake paragraphs boosts performance, but may be infeasible in practice.

In summary, this paper constructs a new QA dataset containing contradicting contexts to evaluate model robustness to misinformation. Both human-written and model-generated misinformation significantly degrade QA performance. The proposed defense of combining QA with misinformation detection helps, but relies on large labeled data. Further research is needed to build robust QA systems that can handle real-world misinformation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called BART Fake Contexts Generator (BART-FG) to generate fake contexts that contradict real contexts, in order to study the impact of misinformation on question answering models. The key idea is to iteratively mask and regenerate constituency spans in the original context paragraph to produce modified fake versions. First, constituency parsing is applied to extract phrases representing complete semantic units. Then, a constituency phrase is randomly selected and replaced with a mask token. The masked phrase is filled in by a pretrained BART model that has been fine-tuned on a novel self-supervised task called Gap Constituency Filling, where the model learns to predict a masked constituency phrase given surrounding sentence contexts. This process is repeated iteratively to generate the fake context. The contradictory fake and real contexts are then combined and fed into QA models to evaluate their robustness. The proposed framework generates controlled edits focused on key semantic constituents, in order to create fluent fake contexts with targeted contradictory information.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, the paper is addressing the following main problem:

Question answering (QA) systems are vulnerable to misinformation and contradicting contexts, which can mislead them to give incorrect answers. This is a concern as real-world QA systems need to deal with noisy web corpora containing misinformation. 

The key research questions the paper seeks to investigate are:

- Are current QA models robust to contradicting contexts containing both real and fake information? 

- Are they more vulnerable to human-written or machine-generated fake contexts?

- Can a more robust QA system be built that integrates misinformation detection to mitigate this problem?

To study this, the paper introduces a new dataset called ContraQA which contains over 10K human-written and model-generated contradicting context pairs. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art QA models suffer a significant performance drop on ContraQA. The paper also proposes a model called BART-FG to generate fake contexts in a controlled manner. Finally, a misinformation-aware QA system is built that jointly performs question answering and fake context detection, which is shown to improve performance.

In summary, the key problem is that QA systems are vulnerable to misinformation and contradicting contexts. The paper aims to demonstrate this vulnerability, and propose methods to construct a robust QA system.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called BART-FG for generating fake contexts by iteratively masking and re-generating constituency spans from the original context. What is the motivation behind masking and regenerating constituents rather than full sentences or arbitrary spans? How does operating at the constituency level allow for more controlled and efficient contradiction generation?

2. The constituency parsing step is crucial for identifying key phrases to mask in the iterative rewriting process. What constituency types does BART-FG consider for masking (e.g. NPs, VPs etc.)? How sensitive is the overall approach to errors in constituency parsing? Have the authors explored using other syntactic parsers? 

3. The gap constituency filling pre-training task is introduced to teach the BART model how to plausibly fill masked constituency spans. Why is it important to condition the span generation on surrounding context (previous and next sentences)? Would a language modeling objective alone be insufficient? How much does the GCF pre-training improve span generation quality over vanilla BART?

4. The paper shows BART-FG is more efficient at creating contradictions than GPT-2 based generation. To what extent can the iterative constituent editing strategy employed by BART-FG also work with other neural generative models besides BART, like GPT-2? Would this allow improved control over contradiction generation?

5. When evaluating human vs machine-generated contradictions, the paper introduces an "average edit distance" metric. What exactly does this measure? Why is it a useful indicator for comparing the quality of different contradiction generation methods? Are there any limitations or potential caveats of this metric?

6. For the human annotation experiments, what guidelines and interfaces were provided to crowdworkers to ensure high-quality contradictory rewrites? How repeatable is this human annotation process? If new crowdworkers were employed, would they produce similar fake contexts? 

7. The paper shows BART-FG can tune the number of edits K to control the tradeoff between contradiction and realism. What is the impact of increasing K beyond 3 in terms of QA performance and detection accuracy? Is there a point of diminishing returns where more edits cease to boost contradiction power?

8. The paper employs a binary classifier to detect real vs fake contexts. What neural architectures were explored for the classifier? Did the authors experiment with multiclass classification to distinguish human vs BART-FG generated fakes? What performance impact did that have?

9. To construct the dataset, fake contexts were generated for the SQuAD Wikipedia paragraphs. What is the potential impact of domain mismatch if BART-FG were applied to non-Wikipedia text? How can the approach be adapted to different domains?

10. The contradiction generation method is analyzed in the context of extractive question answering. To what extent could BART-FG be used to generate contradictions for other NLP tasks involving natural language understanding, like entailment or commonsense reasoning?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph for the paper:

This paper investigates the vulnerability of open-domain question answering (QA) models to misinformation. The authors propose a "misinformation attack" where they inject both human-written and model-generated fake documents into the evidence corpus used by QA systems. They curate fake passages by having humans edit Wikipedia articles and by using a novel model called BART-FG to iteratively mask and regenerate spans in the original passage. Experiments reveal that injecting even a small number of fake passages causes a significant drop in performance across various QA models, showing they are sensitive to misinformation pollution in the evidence corpus. The attack is particularly effective when fake articles are produced at scale or target specific questions. The results demonstrate the need to build more robust QA systems that can reason about and defend against misinformation. The authors call for future work on misinformation-aware QA models that integrate fact checking abilities.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper investigates the robustness of open-domain question answering (QA) models when the evidence corpus is contaminated with misinformation. The authors create fake versions of Wikipedia passages both manually and using a proposed model called BART-FG. They inject these fake passages into a clean evidence corpus and evaluate the impact on QA performance. The results show that QA models suffer noticeable performance drops even with small amounts of misinformation pollution. The drop is more significant when the misinformation specifically targets the answers for certain questions. The paper concludes that QA systems are vulnerable to misinformation and there is a need to develop more robust models, such as by integrating fact checking or reasoning over contradicting contexts. Overall, the work highlights the potential threat of misinformation to QA systems and the need for models that are aware of and robust to misinformation.
