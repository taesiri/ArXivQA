# [Stochastic Optimal Control Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02027)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a new iterative diffusion optimization (IDO) technique for learning stochastic optimal controls. SOCM trains the control by solving a least squares regression problem to fit a random "matching" vector field that depends on learned reparameterization matrices. A bias-variance analysis shows SOCM has the same expected loss landscape as the cross-entropy method but allows reducing variance. Optimizing the reparameterization matrices aims to minimize the variance of the matching field. The core methodological innovation is the "pathwise reparameterization trick," allowing low-variance gradient estimates of conditional expectations w.r.t. stochastic process initial conditions. Experiments on four control tasks show SOCM achieves lower error than previous IDO methods. A "Gaussian warm start" strategy initializes the control function to induce near-Gaussian stochastic paths. Overall, the convex optimization landscape, variance reduction, and warm start enable stable training and improved performance over competing IDO methods.
