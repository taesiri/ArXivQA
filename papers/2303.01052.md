# [Demystifying Causal Features on Adversarial Examples and Causal   Inoculation for Robust Network by Adversarial Instrumental Variable   Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01052)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we uncover the underlying causal features that lead to adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks, and leverage this knowledge to improve adversarial robustness?Specifically, the key goals of the paper seem to be:- To develop a method to estimate the causal features inherent in adversarial examples that are highly related to correct prediction and robustness against adversarial attacks. - To analyze and interpret these estimated causal features to gain insights into the true origin of adversarial examples.- To use these causal features to improve the robustness of neural network defenses against adversarial attacks. The core hypothesis is that by framing the problem from a causal perspective and using adversarial instrumental variable regression, they can identify intrinsic causal features in adversarial examples that provide insights into the fundamental vulnerability. By inoculating these "causal features" into defense models, they aim to enhance robustness against a wide range of adversarial attacks.The paper proposes an adversarial instrumental variable regression method called AMR-GMM to extract these causal features, analyzes their properties, provides visual interpretations, and validates their usefulness by incorporating them into several defense models to improve robustness. Overall, the central thrust is on unveiling and utilizing the causal mechanisms underlying adversarial vulnerability through a causality-driven approach.
