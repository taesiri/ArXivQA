# [Multimodality in Online Education: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Online education lacks genuine student feedback due to inability to monitor reactions in real-time. This hampers teachers' ability to adapt teaching methods to student needs.
- Single non-verbal cues like facial expressions or posture alone can be ambiguous in determining student emotions and engagement.
- Existing multimodal affect recognition systems rely on clinical data like EEG, or are defined for offline education. They lack feasibility in online settings.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement a multimodal architecture that uses computer vision and speech recognition to assess student emotion from video conferencing. 
- Select best machine learning models for 4 cues - facial recognition, gesture/posture recognition, eye tracking and speech recognition based on performance analysis.
- Propose weighted parallel decision level fusion technique to combine outputs from different cues and models into final emotion classification.

Key Contributions:
- Compare and select CNN, SVM models for gesture, CNN for facial recognition, SVM for eye tracking and MLPClassifier for speech recognition.  
- Create dataset of 4000 images for gesture/posture covering 3 classes. Use publicly available datasets for other cues.
- Prototype multimodal architecture using matching vectors and weighted majority voting for decision level fusion.
- Demonstrate the working of the architecture through a detailed example.

The paper highlights the need for multimodal affect recognition tailored to online education settings. It analyzes suitable ML models for multiple cues that can be extracted from standard video conferencing, and proposes a novel weighted fusion technique to combine their outputs. Detailed experiments showcase the working of the overall architecture.
