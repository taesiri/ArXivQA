# [EvoSeed: Unveiling the Threat on Deep Neural Networks with Real-World   Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "EvoSeed: Unveiling the Threat on Deep Neural Networks with Real-World Illusions":

Problem:
Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small perturbations to inputs that cause misclassification. Prior approaches for generating adversarial examples often rely on white-box access to models, alter image distributions compared to training data, or are tailored to specific classifiers. This limits their applicability in black-box real-world scenarios.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes EvoSeed, a novel framework to generate natural adversarial examples using evolutionary strategies. EvoSeed requires only black-box access to an auxiliary conditional diffusion model $G$ and classifier model $F$. It leverages CMA-ES to optimize an initial seed vector $z$ such that when processed by $G$, results in an image $x$ misclassified by $F$. An $L_\infty$ constraint on $z$ ensures $x$ remains close to $G$'s training distribution.

Key Contributions:

- Black-box framework to generate natural adversarial examples using conditional diffusion models and evolutionary optimization 

- Demonstrates EvoSeed can find high quality adversarial examples that: 
   - Fool robust and non-robust classifiers
   - Have Fr√©chet Inception Distance and Inception Scores close to clean data
   - Transfer to different classifier architectures

- Analysis reveals inherent adversarial patterns between labels exist across classifiers and training distributions

- First application of evolutionary strategies for generating natural adversarial examples in conditional diffusion models

The work unveils vulnerabilities of classifiers to natural distribution shifts. Further research into enhancing model robustness against such real-world adversarial attacks is motivated.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes EvoSeed, an evolutionary strategy to generate high-quality, natural adversarial examples by optimizing an initial seed vector fed into a conditional diffusion model to fool a classifier model in a model-agnostic black-box setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing EvoSeed, a novel evolutionary strategy-based algorithmic framework to generate natural adversarial samples. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) EvoSeed is the first framework based on an evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) designed to generate unrestricted natural adversarial examples in a model-agnostic black-box setting. 

2) The framework can generate high-quality adversarial images that are misclassified by various classifier models, including both robust and non-robust models, while still having similarity to the original data distribution.

3) Experiments demonstrate that EvoSeed can find substantially more and higher quality adversarial samples compared to a baseline random search method.

4) Analysis shows the adversarial samples generated by EvoSeed have some transferability to different classifier models not used during the search.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new approach using evolutionary strategies to generate natural adversarial examples that exposes vulnerabilities in classifier models. The key innovation is using CMA-ES to optimize the search for an adversarial seed vector that can fool classifiers when passed through a diffusion model.
