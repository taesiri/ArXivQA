## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image generative models can produce high-quality fake images from textual descriptions. However, these models raise concerns about potential misuse of generated images. It is important to attribute an AI-generated fake image back to its source model to hold model owners accountable. Existing attribution methods have limitations: they require re-training when new models emerge, have high computational costs, and may not generalize well to unseen models.  

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes a training-free attribution method that can effectively trace fake images back to the source text-to-image models. The key idea is to leverage regeneration and similarity comparison. Given a test image, the method first reconstructs the textual prompt using off-the-shelf textual prompt inversion tools. It then inputs the prompt into candidate models to regenerate new fake images. By comparing similarity scores between the test image and regenerated images, the method ranks candidate models and selects the one generating the most similar images as the source.  

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a simple yet effective training-free framework for attributing fake images to text-to-image models
- Achieves attribution performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods 
- Demonstrates high scalability - the method can handle an increasing number of candidate models
- Exhibits robustness against common image perturbations
- Can serve as a plug-in to improve existing attribution methods
- Provides insights on factors influencing attribution performance 

The method addresses key challenges in AI-generated image attribution. By eliminating the need for re-training, it is more adaptable and efficient for real-world use cases. The experiments highlight its effectiveness and robustness. This work is an important step towards traceability and accountability of AI generative models.
