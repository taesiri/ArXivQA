# [A Picture is Worth 500 Labels: A Case Study of Demographic Disparities   in Local Machine Learning Models for Instagram and TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19717)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper investigates two popular social media apps - TikTok and Instagram - that utilize machine learning models to analyze user images and videos locally on the user's device. The key research questions are: (1) what insights do these vision models extract about users from images/videos? and (2) do these models exhibit performance disparities with respect to demographics? Understanding potential biases is important to ensure users receive equitable services. However, analyzing these models faces challenges like code obfuscation, native execution, and scalability.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop a 3-layer methodology to dynamically capture and evaluate ML tasks in apps:

1) ML Detection Layer: Instruments Android OS to log targeted function calls to identify evidence of ML execution from arguments and return values.

2) Pipeline Reconstruction Layer: Combines static and dynamic analysis to rebuild execution pipeline - traces function calls across Java and native code to complete the path from model input to output. 

3) ML Assessment Layer: Evaluates model performance by automatically injecting diverse custom datasets into reconstructed pipeline and analyzing output scores for demographic disparities.

The framework is applied to analyze vision models in TikTok and Instagram.

Key Contributions:

- Novel dynamic instrumentation approach to identify ML tasks in apps overcoming code obfuscation and native execution challenges.

- Hybrid static-dynamic analysis methodology to reconstruct complete native and Java ML execution pipelines. 

- Custom datasets with demographic and semantic diversity to evaluate model performance disparities in apps.

- Analysis revealing issues in TikTok's age and gender prediction, especially for minors and Black individuals.

- Evidence of spurious correlations between demographics and unrelated concepts in Instagram's 500+ concept extractor.

The methodology and findings significantly advance the understanding of potential biases in widely used models in social media apps.
