# [Multi-Stage Contrastive Regression for Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing methods for video-based action quality assessment (AQA) analyze the entire video without considering the inherent multi-stage characteristics of complex actions. This overlooks important stage-level information and differences between videos.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Multi-stage Contrastive Regression (MCoRe) framework that segments the input video into multiple stages and performs contrastive regression between the query and exemplar videos at the stage level.

Key Contributions:

1. A spatial-temporal feature extractor using a 2D CNN backbone and Gate Shift Module to efficiently capture frame-level and motion features from the video.

2. A procedure segmentation network using BiGRU and contrastive loss to divide the video into semantic stages and align them between query and exemplar videos. 

3. A scoring network that computes relative quality scores between corresponding stages in the query and exemplar videos using attention-based decoders. The scores are aggregated to obtain the final quality score.

4. A new stage-wise contrastive loss function that distinguishes features from the same and different stages across videos to enhance segmentation.

5. State-of-the-art results on the FineDiving dataset for both action quality assessment and procedure segmentation while being significantly more lightweight than previous methods.

In summary, the key innovation is a multi-stage contrastive regression approach that aligns procedure segments across videos and performs fine-grained comparative scoring to achieve more accurate quality assessment. This provides new state-of-the-art results on a challenging dataset while requiring fewer computations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-stage contrastive regression (MCoRe) framework for fine-grained action quality assessment, which segments videos into stages, aligns them between pairs, and compares them using a novel stage-wise contrastive loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a multi-stage contrastive regression (MCoRe) framework for procedure segmentation and action quality assessment. 

2) Introducing a contrastive loss that compares the intra-video and inter-video stage information for reasonable procedure segmentation.

3) Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the fine-grained AQA dataset for diving videos.

In summary, the key contribution is designing a new method (MCoRe) that divides videos into stages and performs contrastive regression between aligned stages of different videos to enhance action quality assessment. This approach also achieves better stage segmentation and overall scoring accuracy compared to previous methods on a fine-grained diving dataset.
