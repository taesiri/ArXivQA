# [BIKED++: A Multimodal Dataset of 1.4 Million Bicycle Image and   Parametric CAD Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world engineering design problems require reasoning across multiple data modalities (text, images, parameters, etc.). However, most design datasets are unimodal, making it hard to develop multimodal machine learning models.  
- The BIKED bicycle design dataset has parametric and image representations but only contains 4,500 human-designed models, which is insufficient to train high-quality multimodal models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new dataset called BIKED++ with 1.4 million procedurally-generated bicycle designs represented in both parametric and image formats. 
- The dataset is created by sampling parametric design vectors, checking constraints, converting them to BikeCAD files, rendering vector graphics, and rasterizing to PNG images. 
- CLIP embeddings are also calculated for each image to enable establishing cross-modal connections between parameters, images, and text.

Key Contributions:
- The new large-scale multimodal BIKED++ dataset of 1.4M parametric and corresponding rasterized bicycle images.
- A BikeCAD-based rendering engine pipeline to generate vector and rasterized images from parametric bicycle designs. 
- Demonstration of training a machine learning model to predict CLIP embeddings directly from parameters, enabling cross-modal parametric optimization tasks using text/image-based objectives.
- The dataset and code are publicly released to enable further research into multimodal bicycle design and modeling.

In summary, the key innovation is the large-scale multimodal dataset to bridge parametric and image representations of procedural bicycle designs, allowing development of cross-modal deep learning models for tasks like optimization and retrieval.
