# [Traj-LIO: A Resilient Multi-LiDAR Multi-IMU State Estimator Through   Sparse Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09189)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) systems struggle to fuse data from multiple asynchronous sensors and are susceptible to sensor failure due to reliance on IMU for motion compensation and state propagation.

- Discrete-time estimators require adding new states at each timestamp, leading to unbounded optimization complexity for multi-sensor systems. 

- Continuous-time methods rely on IMU for motion distortion compensation or state propagation, failing with abnormal IMU data.

- Prior GP-based estimators are limited to LiDAR-only odometry and unable to achieve real-time performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A continuous-time multi-LiDAR multi-IMU state estimator using Gaussian Process (GP) to model a non-parametric trajectory that captures spatial-temporal movement with limited control states.

- Self-driven kinematic model based on GP prior that is independent of IMU measurements, making system resilient to IMU failure.

- Decoupled state space of rotation in SO(3) and translation in vector space, avoiding complexities of SE(3) and enabling real-time performance.

- Analytic Jacobians for efficient optimization.

Main Contributions:

1) A versatile continuous-time estimator adaptable to various sensor configurations through GP trajectory representation and extrinsic calibration.

2) A resilient self-driven kinematic model based on GP prior that is independent of IMU measurements.

3) A real-time GP-based LIO approach by decoupling state space into rotation in SO(3) and translation in vector space, facilitating analytic Jacobians.

The system is evaluated on public datasets with different sensors and in various failure scenarios, demonstrating accuracy, versatility, resilience and real-time capabilities.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A versatile continuous-time multi-LiDAR multi-IMU state estimator through Gaussian Process, which is adaptable to various kinds of sensor configuration.
