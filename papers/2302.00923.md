# Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research question addressed in this paper is how to perform effective chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in language models for multimodal inputs. Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called "Multimodal-CoT" that aims to incorporate both language (text) and vision (images) modalities to perform multi-step reasoning and generate rationales before inferring the final answer. The key hypothesis is that incorporating visual signals and having a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference will allow models to produce more effective rationales. In turn, these better rationales generated from multimodal information can contribute to more accurate answer prediction compared to just using language context.The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed Multimodal-CoT framework can lead to improved performance over previous state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.5 on multimodal reasoning tasks. The results provide support for the hypothesis that multimodality and the two-stage approach help generate better rationales and improve answer accuracy.In summary, the central research question is how to perform CoT reasoning with multimodal inputs in language models, and the key hypothesis is that incorporating vision along with separating rationale generation and answer inference in a two-stage framework will improve multimodal reasoning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called Multimodal-CoT to incorporate visual signals into chain-of-thought reasoning for language models. Specifically:1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference. This allows the answer inference stage to leverage better generated rationales based on multimodal information. 2. The framework incorporates both language (text) and vision (images) modalities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to study chain-of-thought reasoning across modalities.3. The method achieves new state-of-the-art results on the ScienceQA benchmark, outperforming GPT-3.5 by 16% in accuracy. The performance surpasses human-level.4. The approach focuses on models under 1 billion parameters that can be trained with consumer-grade GPUs, making it more accessible than methods relying on large language models.5. Analysis shows that using vision features helps generate more informative rationales and mitigate the issue of hallucination compared to using only text. This demonstrates the benefits of incorporating multimodal signals into chain-of-thought reasoning.In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective and accessible framework to perform multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, which achieves superior performance over strong baselines on a complex reasoning benchmark. The incorporation and analysis of vision features are novel and help address key challenges faced by previous chain-of-thought methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning approach for question answering, which incorporates both language (text) and vision (images) as input modalities. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:- Focus on multimodality: Most prior work on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has focused solely on textual reasoning, without considering visual information. This paper explores CoT in a multimodal setting, which is novel and expands the scope of CoT reasoning.- Two-stage framework: The proposed Multimodal-CoT uses a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference. This differs from typical CoT methods that perform both steps together. The decoupled approach helps leverage multimodal information to generate better rationales.- Application to 1B models: Many CoT methods rely on large language models (LLMs) over 100B parameters. This work shows CoT can be effective for smaller models under 1B parameters by incorporating multimodal signals.- State-of-the-art results: The method achieves new SOTA accuracy on the ScienceQA benchmark, outperforming GPT-3.5 by a large margin (+16%). It also surpasses human performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.- Detailed analysis: The paper provides in-depth analysis into the challenges of multimodal CoT, such as the issue of hallucinated rationales. This sheds light on the inner workings of CoT reasoning in LMs.Overall, the key novelty is enabling CoT reasoning in a multimodal setting, which has been relatively unexplored. The work makes CoT more accessible by showing its efficacy without relying on massive models like GPT-3. The ideas could inspire more research into multimodal reasoning and rationale generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest a few potential future research directions:1. Incorporating more advanced vision features and vision-language interaction methods: The authors note that some errors occur due to limitations in understanding maps, counting objects in images, etc. Using more informative vision features and better techniques for language-vision interaction could help the model understand such concepts better.2. Injecting commonsense knowledge: Many errors occur due to lack of commonsense reasoning. Incorporating commonsense knowledge graphs or models could help reduce these types of mistakes.3. Applying filtering mechanisms for chain-of-thought: The authors find the model sometimes produces irrelevant or incorrect rationale that harms answer accuracy. Developing methods to filter or select only the effective chain-of-thought steps could further improve performance. 4. Exploring different prompting methods: The current work relies on a simple prompting format with examples. More sophisticated prompting techniques could potentially improve the quality of generated rationales.5. Scaling up models: Larger language models may have increased reasoning and commonsense abilities. The authors suggest exploring larger models in future work.In summary, the key future directions are improving language-vision interaction, injecting commonsense knowledge, filtering chain-of-thought rationales, using better prompts, and scaling up models. Advances in these areas could help further improve the accuracy and reasoning ability of multimodal chain-of-thought models.
