# [DreamEditor: Text-Driven 3D Scene Editing with Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13455)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable intuitive and precise text-guided editing of 3D scenes represented by neural fields?The key hypothesis is that by representing the 3D scene with a mesh-based neural field and developing a systematic pipeline to identify and optimize only the relevant regions based on text prompts, it is possible to achieve accurate and high-quality editing of neural fields through simple text instructions.In summary, the paper aims to develop an effective framework to edit neural fields of 3D scenes using just text prompts as input, while ensuring the edits are precisely applied only to the intended regions and maintaining high visual quality. The core research question is how to enable such intuitive text-guided editing of neural fields representing complex 3D scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the key contributions of this paper:- The paper presents a novel framework for text-guided editing of 3D scenes represented by neural fields. Given a text prompt, it can modify the shape and appearance of objects in the scene while maintaining consistency in irrelevant regions.- A mesh-based neural field representation is proposed to enable precise spatially-selective editing. The mesh disentangles geometry and texture, preventing unnecessary geometry changes when editing texture.- A stepwise pipeline is devised that first identifies the editing region based on text prompts using cross-attention maps from a fine-tuned diffusion model. Editing is then performed locally in this region through score distillation sampling.- Experiments on diverse real-world scenes like faces, objects, and outdoor environments demonstrate the method's ability to generate realistic and precise editing results. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons show superiority over previous text-guided neural field editing techniques.In summary, the key innovation is the mesh-based representation and stepwise editing pipeline that allows accurate and flexible editing of neural fields through natural language prompts. This greatly simplifies the editing process compared to previous approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called DreamEditor that enables intuitive text-guided editing of 3D scenes represented by neural radiance fields, achieving localized and high-fidelity modifications through a mesh-based representation and stepwise pipeline for identifying and optimizing editing regions based on semantic text prompts.
