# [DreamEditor: Text-Driven 3D Scene Editing with Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13455)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable intuitive and precise text-guided editing of 3D scenes represented by neural fields?The key hypothesis is that by representing the 3D scene with a mesh-based neural field and developing a systematic pipeline to identify and optimize only the relevant regions based on text prompts, it is possible to achieve accurate and high-quality editing of neural fields through simple text instructions.In summary, the paper aims to develop an effective framework to edit neural fields of 3D scenes using just text prompts as input, while ensuring the edits are precisely applied only to the intended regions and maintaining high visual quality. The core research question is how to enable such intuitive text-guided editing of neural fields representing complex 3D scenes.
