# [Low-resource classification of mobility functioning information in   clinical sentences using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10202)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Function is an important health indicator but functional status information often remains hidden in unstructured clinical text, restricting the extraction of valuable real-world insights to enhance care. 
- Effectively extracting and interpreting functional data from EHRs is challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop classification methods to rapidly identify the presence of relevant functional information within clinical notes to help clinicians efficiently review the most critical sentences.

Objectives:
1) Evaluate publicly available large language models (LLMs) on identifying mobility functioning information in clinical sentences, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.
2) Fine-tune LLMs using a parameter-efficient prompt-based approach and analyze performance under low-resource settings. 
3) Release an annotated dataset for mobility functioning classification to enable further LLM applications in healthcare.  

Methods:
- Curate a balanced 1000-sentence dataset labeled with the presence of mobility functioning, derived from physical therapy notes.
- Construct prompts to query LLMs whether sentences contain mobility information. Evaluate in-context learning performance.
- Sample demonstrations via random and kNN-based sampling to provide examples in the prompt.
- Apply parameter-efficient prompt tuning and compare to traditional full model fine-tuning.

Main Results:  
- Flan-T5-xxl achieves highest F1 of 0.865 in few-shot prompting and 0.922 after prompt tuning with full dataset.
- kNN sampling outperforms random sampling overall.
- With only 2.3M additional parameters, prompt-tuned Flan-T5-xl reaches over 0.9 F1 score comparable to fully tuned GPT model.

Conclusions:
- Instruction-tuned LLMs show strong zero-shot and few-shot performance for mobility functioning classification.
- Further parameter-efficient prompt-based fine-tuning with limited labeled data leads to additional significant gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the ability of publicly available large language models to accurately identify the presence of mobility functioning information in clinical notes, finding that instruction-tuned models demonstrate impressive in-context learning capability which can be further improved via parameter-efficient prompt-based fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors evaluate the performance of publicly available large language models (LLMs) in identifying the presence of mobility functioning information from clinical notes, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. They show that kNN-based sampling for selecting demonstrative examples improves few-shot performance over random sampling.

2. The authors further fine-tune these LLMs using a parameter-efficient prompt-based approach, which yields higher classification accuracy than the few-shot approach. They analyze performance under low-resource settings and show this approach outperforms traditional full-model fine-tuning of BERT models. 

3. The authors release the annotated dataset used in this study to the research community, to enable further applications of LLMs in healthcare.

In summary, the main contribution is leveraging publicly available LLMs for identifying mobility functioning information in clinical notes, showing their effectiveness in low-resource settings, and releasing an annotated dataset to facilitate further research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores both in-context learning and prompt-based fine-tuning approaches. What are the key differences between these two approaches and what are the relative advantages/disadvantages of each?

2. The paper evaluates several large language models such as T0, Flan-T5, Flan-UL2, and Llama 2 Chat. What are the key differences between these models in terms of their architecture, pre-training objectives, and downstream performance? 

3. For the few-shot learning experiments, two sampling techniques - random sampling and kNN-based sampling are used to select demonstrations. What is the intuition behind using kNN-based sampling and why does it tend to outperform random sampling?

4. The prompt structure contains task instructions, demonstrations, and test sentences. What considerations should be made in formulating effective prompts and how could prompt engineering further improve performance?  

5. The parameter-efficient prompt tuning method LORA is used. How does LORA work to reduce computational requirements compared to full model fine-tuning? What are its limitations?

6. Flan-T5-xxl achieved the overall best performance. Analyze and discuss the key factors that likely contributed to its strong performance over the other models.

7. Low-resource fine-tuning experiments are conducted with 50, 100 and 250 training examples. How does performance scale with more training data and when does it surpass few-shot learning?

8. The fully fine-tuned BERT-based models required 110M and 355M parameters to be updated. Contrast this to the 2.3M LoRA parameters used by Flan-T5-xl to surpass 0.9 F1 score. Discuss the significance of these results.

9. What benefits does the parameter-efficient tuning approach offer for tackling NLP tasks in the healthcare domain? What practical challenges still need to be addressed?

10. The paper releases an annotated dataset for future research. What kinds of follow-up studies could directly build upon this released resource to further advance human functioning classification from clinical text?
