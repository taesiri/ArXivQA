# [Automated System-level Testing of Unmanned Aerial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15857)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents an automated approach for system-level testing of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). UAS consist of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground control station (GCS). Testing UAS is challenging due to the need to simulate various flight scenarios. Existing approaches require manual effort in test scenario creation, execution and evaluation. 

The paper proposes an AI-based automated testing approach (AITester) that utilizes model-based testing (MBT) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inputs to AITester are: (1) UAS domain model using a UAS structural UML profile; (2) UAV flight behavior model using a UAV behavioral UML profile; (3) Expected behavior constraints in OCL. AITester incorporates a DRL agent that interacts with a UAV simulator to generate diverse test scenarios at runtime aiming to violate OCL constraints. Violations represent deviations from expected behavior, indicating potential faults.

Key contributions:
(1) UML profiles to model structural and behavioral UAS aspects; 
(2) Automated test generation approach using MBT and DRL that executes tests on a UAV simulator;
(3) Reward function design that guides the DRL agent to violate OCL constraints;
(4) Empirical evaluation on an open-source UAV autopilot system and an industrial GCS case study showing the effectiveness of AITester in violating expected behavior.

The automated testing methodology and tool support can assist avionics testers. Future work will focus on automating additional testing tasks like test oracles generation and fault localization. The limitations include need for correct UAS models, inability to handle complex constraints and testing UAV swarms.
