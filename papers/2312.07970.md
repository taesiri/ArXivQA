# [Divide and Conquer: Hybrid Pre-training for Person Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07970)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pre-training framework specifically designed for the person search task, which involves detecting and re-identifying people in images simultaneously. Due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets for person search, the authors leverage existing datasets for the sub-tasks of pedestrian detection and person re-identification for pre-training. They introduce a hybrid learning approach to handle datasets with different levels of annotation in a unified framework. Specifically, both self-supervised and fully-supervised objectives are utilized. In addition, an intra-task alignment module is proposed to reduce domain discrepancy across different datasets of the same sub-task. Extensive analyses demonstrate significant and consistent improvements from using their pre-trained models instead of standard ImageNet pre-trained models. Their approach delivers state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-SYSU and PRW benchmarks. The code and models are released to benefit the research community. Their attempt at full-task pre-training using sub-task data is the first of its kind and serves as an encouraging starting point for future exploration.
