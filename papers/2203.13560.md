# MISC: A MIxed Strategy-Aware Model Integrating COMET for Emotional   Support Conversation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis addressed in this paper is: How can we build an empathetic chatbot that is better able to provide emotional support in conversations by modeling the user's fine-grained emotional state and employing a mixture of conversational strategies?The key points are:1. Existing empathetic chatbots have limitations in emotional support conversations because they rely on coarse conversation-level emotion labels and do not aim to gradually reduce the user's distress. 2. This paper proposes a new model called MISC that addresses these issues by:- Using the COMET commonsense reasoning model to infer the user's fine-grained emotional status for better understanding. - Modeling response strategies as a probability distribution over a strategy codebook, allowing a mixture of strategies to be employed.3. The central hypothesis is that by enhancing fine-grained emotion understanding and modeling mixed strategies, the MISC model can generate more relevant, empathetic responses for emotional support.So in summary, the paper aims to show that fine-grained emotion modeling and mixed strategy incorporation will improve empathetic chatbots, especially for providing emotional support in distressing situations. The proposed MISC model embodies this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel model called MISC for emotional support conversation. The key ideas are:1. Using the commonsense reasoning model COMET to capture the user's fine-grained emotional states instead of relying on coarse conversation-level emotion labels. This allows the model to better understand the user's instant mental status. 2. Incorporating a mixture of strategies into the response generation, represented as a probability distribution over a strategy codebook. This helps the model transition smoothly between strategies within a long empathetic response.3. Jointly training the model for strategy prediction and empathetic response generation based on the encoded context, COMET-enhanced mental states, and mixed strategy representation.In summary, the main contribution is developing a strategy-aware empathetic conversational agent MISC that leverages commonsense reasoning and mixed strategies to provide better emotional support. Experiments on the ESConv dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
