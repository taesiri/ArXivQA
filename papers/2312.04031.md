# [The Importance of Coordinate Frames in Dynamic SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04031)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a graph-based optimization framework to compare different formulations for dynamic SLAM, which simultaneously estimates camera ego-motion and motion of moving objects. It categorizes these formulations as either "object-centric", where dynamic points are represented in the object's local frame, or "world-centric", where they are defined in the global map frame. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, the authors demonstrate that the intuitive object-centric approach, which keeps the number of variables low, often struggles to converge and produces less accurate motion and pose estimates compared to the world-centric method. The object-centric method fails to properly enforce rigid body kinematics in the factor graph, causing oscillating optimization behavior, while the world-centric formulation with explicit motion factors defined in the known map frame optimizes smoothly. By adding additional kinematic factors between object poses, the object-centric results can be improved but still remain inferior. Thus, the central conclusion is that expressing motions and points directly in a known reference frame, despite requiring more variables, enables more accurate and robust dynamic SLAM solutions. The paper provides an analysis and guidelines for selecting appropriate representations when designing optimization-based formulations.
