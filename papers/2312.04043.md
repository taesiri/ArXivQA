## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel framework for generating precise 3D shapes from abstract freehand sketches. The key innovation is a part-level modelling and alignment approach that decomposes both sketches and shapes into disentangled part-based representations. This enables the framework to handle abstract sketches without needing paired sketch-shape data, establish fine-grained correspondences between sketches and shapes, and perform localized in-position shape editing. Specifically, shapes are decomposed into part-latents using a pretrained decoder, which are aligned across categories to establish part-level consistency. The same decoder is conveniently reused to decompose sketch edge maps into parts by transferring 3D part segmentations. A conditional latent diffusion model is then trained on the aligned part-latents for sketch-conditioned shape generation. Crucially, this shape generation pipeline operates in an efficient low-dimensional implicit space, significantly reducing computational overhead. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate precise shape generation from amateur to abstract sketches, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency. Ablations validate the importance of part disentanglement and alignment.
