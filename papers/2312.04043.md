# [Doodle Your 3D: From Abstract Freehand Sketches to Precise 3D Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04043)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel framework for generating precise 3D shapes from abstract freehand sketches. The key innovation is a part-level modelling and alignment approach that decomposes both sketches and shapes into disentangled part-based representations. This enables the framework to handle abstract sketches without needing paired sketch-shape data, establish fine-grained correspondences between sketches and shapes, and perform localized in-position shape editing. Specifically, shapes are decomposed into part-latents using a pretrained decoder, which are aligned across categories to establish part-level consistency. The same decoder is conveniently reused to decompose sketch edge maps into parts by transferring 3D part segmentations. A conditional latent diffusion model is then trained on the aligned part-latents for sketch-conditioned shape generation. Crucially, this shape generation pipeline operates in an efficient low-dimensional implicit space, significantly reducing computational overhead. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate precise shape generation from amateur to abstract sketches, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency. Ablations validate the importance of part disentanglement and alignment.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces a part-level modelling and alignment framework. What is the intuition behind using part-level representations for modelling abstraction in sketches? How does it help with generalization to freehand doodles?

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

- Introduce part-level modeling and alignment framework for shapes and sketches.
- Decompose shapes into disentangled part latents using pre-trained decoder. Align part latents across shapes.
- Train latent diffusion generative model on aligned latent space to generate part-disentangled shapes.
- Transfer shape part decompositions to rendered 2D edge maps. Pass edgemaps through CLIPasso to get human-like sketches.
- Discover sketch parts by matching regions in CLIPasso sketches and projected 3D part regions.
- Use same decoder to decode aligned sketch & shape latents to establish correspondence.

Key Contributions:

In summary, the key innovation is the unified part-level modeling approach that aligns latent spaces of shapes and sketches to achieve precise cross-modal generation and editing from abstract sketches, without needing any paired sketch-shape data.
