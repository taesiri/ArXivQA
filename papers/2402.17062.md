# [HOISDF: Constraining 3D Hand-Object Pose Estimation with Global Signed   Distance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Jointly estimating 3D poses of hands and manipulated objects from images is challenging, especially when they are heavily occluded. Existing methods struggle in such cases because they rely on intermediate 3D representations that are either explicit (e.g. point clouds, meshes) or none, thus providing limited 3D shape information to guide the pose estimation. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes HOISDF, a novel network that uses global signed distance fields (SDFs) as an implicit intermediate 3D representation to provide robust shape information for guiding the pose estimation. Specifically, HOISDF has two key components:

1. A module to jointly learn global hand and object SDFs in the original camera space without canonical alignment. This provides an implicit 3D shape representation focused more on global plausibility rather than local details. 

2. A field-guided pose regression module that effectively samples informative points near the predicted surfaces, augments them with SDF-based features, enhances them with cross hand-object cues, and aggregates features to estimate poses using point-wise attention.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces using SDFs as an intermediate representation to provide global shape constraints for hand-object pose estimation, instead of just surface reconstruction.
- Proposes a field-guided pose regression module to effectively exploit the dense, global SDF information to guide pose estimation.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on DexYCB and HO3Dv2 datasets, demonstrating the benefits of using SDFs to provide global shape context.

The main insight is that global SDFs are more effective than existing representations for providing 3D shape information to deal with mutual occlusions in hand-object pose estimation. The field-guided regression module is key to exploit this global dense field information.
