# [Federated Fairness without Access to Sensitive Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of achieving fairness across different sensitive groups in federated learning settings when there is no prior knowledge about the definition of sensitive groups during training. Factors like emerging regulations, group dynamics, and location-dependency make it unrealistic to have predefined labeled sensitive groups in many real-world federated learning applications. Existing approaches rely on the availability of sensitive group information.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new learning objective called Relaxed Conditional Value-at-Risk (RCVaR) to enhance the performance of the worst-performing subset of data samples without unnecessarily reducing the performance of others. The objective depends on two parameters:

1) Trade-off parameter epsilon that controls the balance between average utility and worst-case (minimax) fairness. 

2) Constraint rho that bounds the size of the worst-case group based on policy/preferences.

The formulation allows identifying any sufficiently large global sensitive group independently of whether it exists in local distributions. It also enables flexibility in the fairness-utility trade-off.

The paper provides an algorithm called FedSRCVaR to solve a smoothed approximation of RCVaR in the federated setting. The algorithm performs local model updates on clients and periodic averaging on the server.

Main Contributions:

- First work to address unknown and inhomogeneous sensitive groups for minimax Pareto federated fairness.

- Introduction of a new flexible fairness-aware learning objective RCVaR that allows improving high-risk samples based only on a group size constraint.

- Drawing connections between RCVaR and existing objectives like DRO and BPF, showing RCVaR generalizes them.

- Algorithm FedSRCVaR to solve RCVaR in federation, with convergence rate and excess risk guarantees.

- Empirical demonstration of achieving a wide range of fairness-utility trade-offs using the epsilon parameter and comparsion to relevant baselines in centralized and federated settings.
