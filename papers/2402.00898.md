# [An Early Categorization of Prompt Injection Attacks on Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00898)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are being used in more applications, but they can potentially generate harmful or biased content. 
- Developers have tried restricting outputs, but users are finding ways to bypass these restrictions through "prompt injections" - crafting inputs that trick the LLM into generating unwanted content.
- Prompt injections are an emerging threat, but there is little research categorizing the types of attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors reviewed academic papers and online sources to compile a list of prompt injection attack types. 
- They categorize attacks as either "direct" (malformed inputs to the LLM interface) or "indirect" (delivering attacks through other vectors like emails).
- They identify 6 classes of direct attacks (e.g. double character, virtualization) and 4 classes of indirect attacks (e.g. active injections, user-driven injections).
- They provide examples of each attack type.

Main Contributions:
- First categorization of known prompt injection attacks
- Comprehensive overview of the prompt injection threat landscape
- Discussion of implications for LLM developers and end users
- Guidelines for building more robust LLM interfaces 
- Identification of future research directions on defending against prompt injections

In summary, the paper documents the emerging threat of prompt injections against LLMs, provides a categorization of known attacks, and offers recommendations for dealing with this issue. Key contributions are the attack categorization and the analysis of implications for various stakeholders.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides an overview and categorization of prompt injection attacks against large language models, discussing direct attacks that bypass restrictions to generate malicious outputs as well as indirect attacks with goals such as data extraction and poisoning model training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the categories and the key information on each class of prompt injections which were summarized in tables 2 and 3. Specifically, the paper proposes a categorization of prompt injection attacks into two main branches - direct and indirect - and further divides them into six and four classes respectively. The descriptions and objectives of each class are provided. This categorization is intended to help scholars and practitioners understand this emerging threat and can act as a checklist for vulnerabilities when developing AI systems using large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Prompt injection
- Large language model (LLM)
- AI chatbot
- Categorization
- Direct prompt injection
- Indirect prompt injection
- Virtualization
- Obfuscation
- Payload splitting
- Adversarial suffix
- Goal hijacking 
- Prompt leaking
- Active injections
- Passive injections
- User-driven injections
- Virtual prompt injection
- Security vulnerability
- Cyber threat

The paper provides a categorization of different types of prompt injection attacks against large language models and AI chatbots. It identifies direct attacks that are input directly into the LLM interface, and indirect attacks that exploit secondary vectors like training data or plugins. Some key terms describe specific techniques like virtualization, obfuscation, payload splitting, etc. Others refer to the overarching categories proposed in the paper. The terms also relate to the security implications of prompt injections.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes prompt injections into direct and indirect types. What are the key differences between these two categories? How might the objectives and attack vectors differ?

2. Within direct prompt injections, there are several subclasses identified such as double character, virtualization, and obfuscation. Can you explain the key idea behind each of these subclasses and how they allow bypassing restrictions? 

3. The paper demonstrates payload splitting as one approach to direct prompt injections. What is the logic behind splitting the payload over multiple prompts? What are the challenges in detecting and blocking this type of attack?

4. The paper briefly mentions computational approaches to generating adversarial suffixes for prompt injections. Can you elaborate on how these suffixes are created? And why do they make the attack more challenging to defend against?

5. For indirect prompt injections, what specifically distinguishes active injections from passive or user-driven injections? Can you outline realistic attack scenarios for each?

6. Virtual prompt injections are used to manipulate the training data for language models. What could the long-term implications be if this type of attack goes undetected? How might it impact end users?

7. The paper proposes creating standardized tests and benchmarks for evaluating vulnerabilities to prompt injections. What key criteria should these benchmarks measure and why are common standards needed?

8. Can you think of any other classes of attacks, beyond what is covered in the paper, that exploit weaknesses in language model interfaces? What creative methods might attackers devise in the future?  

9. The paper discusses implications for developers and end users of AI systems leveraging language models. What specific guidelines and best practices should be adopted to mitigate risks from prompt injections?

10. How might approaches like sandboxing, anomaly detection, input filtering and output sanitization help make chatbots and language model APIs more robust to prompt injection threats? What challenges still remain?
