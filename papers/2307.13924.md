# [trajdata: A Unified Interface to Multiple Human Trajectory Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13924)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question addressed is: How can we develop a unified interface and standardized format to facilitate using multiple diverse autonomous vehicle (AV) trajectory datasets together in research projects? The paper argues that while the release of many large-scale AV trajectory datasets has spurred progress in trajectory forecasting and related research fields, each dataset uses a unique custom data format and API. This makes it difficult for researchers to leverage multiple datasets together in the same project, which is desirable for goals like analyzing model generalization across datasets.To address this problem, the paper introduces "TrajData", which provides:1) A simple, uniform data representation and format to represent both trajectory and map data from different datasets. This includes key elements like agent positions, headings, velocities, map lanes, areas, etc.2) A common API to access, query, and batch this standardized data format to prepare it for downstream usage in frameworks like PyTorch. This API allows easily creating combined datasets sourced from multiple different input datasets.3) Analyses of numerous real-world AV datasets compiled into TrajData's format to gain insights into distributional statistics, motion complexity, annotation quality, etc. This provides users with a deeper understanding of these datasets.4) Suggestions for improvements to future datasets based on the insights uncovered in their analyses.So in summary, the core research contribution is the development of TrajData to standardize access and analysis of diverse AV trajectory datasets to better support multi-dataset research efforts. The authors demonstrate TrajData's utility both through the API itself as well as the extensive comparative analyses conducted across datasets.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field of trajectory forecasting and multi-dataset benchmarks:- The key contribution of this paper is providing a unified interface and standardized formats/APIs for working with multiple trajectory forecasting datasets. Other efforts like TrajNet++ and Atlas have also aimed to create multi-dataset benchmarks, but they focus specifically on pedestrian trajectory prediction. This work covers both pedestrian and autonomous vehicle datasets. - In terms of analyzing and comparing datasets, this is one of the most comprehensive empirical evaluations I've seen. The analyses cover a wide range of metrics related to agent distributions, motion complexity, and annotation quality. Other papers have conducted dataset comparisons, but usually with a narrower focus or fewer datasets covered. The empirical insights in this paper are quite valuable.- The proposed trajdata software provides a simple yet powerful API for loading, preprocessing, and batching trajectory data from different formats. This could make it much easier for researchers to work across datasets compared to using each dataset's native API. The integration of simulation capabilities is also notable.- One limitation is that trajdata currently only handles trajectory data, whereas some other benchmarks like TrajNet++ also incorporate sensor data. Supporting sensor inputs could be useful for perception-related tasks. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest it as future work.- Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution in terms of dataset analysis insights and the trajdata software for multi-dataset research. The comprehensive empirical evaluation of datasets is particularly impressive. This work could help enable more rigorous testing of trajectory forecasting methods across diverse data distributions and settings.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding the number of datasets and capabilities supported by TrajData, such as incorporating sensor data to enable perception research and joint perception-prediction-planning tasks.- Providing researchers access to more diverse data with various agent types and from different geographies. This could help with modeling rare events/behaviors and improving generalization.- Developing techniques to rebalance trajectory data on a semantic/behavioral level within TrajData. Currently there is a bias towards straight line motions.- Ensuring future AV datasets explore all geographic regions within an environment, not just certain areas. This is important for capturing diverse behaviors.- Removing artificial distance cutoffs in autolabeling pipelines, and instead adding uncertainty estimates to long-range detections. This can support research in long-range perception.- Incorporating explicit self-consistency checks in autolabeling to catch errors like collisions before data release. This can improve annotation quality.- Collecting more data from drone-based platforms, which enables more accurate birds-eye view annotations compared to ground-based sensors.In summary, the authors advocate for expanding TrajData's capabilities, collecting more diverse and geographically-varied data, improving annotation quality, and removing biases - in order to facilitate new research directions in perception, prediction, planning and their intersection.
