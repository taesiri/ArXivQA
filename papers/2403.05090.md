# [OCEAN: An Openspace Collision-free Trajectory Planner for Autonomous   Parking Based on ADMM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous parking in dense and cluttered environments is challenging due to the need for efficient collision avoidance evaluation and real-time trajectory optimization. Existing methods have limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency or robustness. Specifically:

- Simplified obstacle representations (e.g. spheres) have low accuracy. 
- Safe corridor methods are too conservative.
- Mixed-integer programming formulations are intractable.  
- Whole-body collision checking methods only apply to convex shapes.  
- ESDF methods have high memory and computational requirements.

Overall, satisfying simultaneous requirements of accuracy, efficiency and robustness has remained an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes OCEAN - an optimization-based collision-avoidance trajectory planner accelerated by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Key aspects include:

- Collision avoidance constraints are reformulated into a convex dual form to enable efficient optimization. 
- The problem is decomposed via ADMM into sub-problems solved iteratively in parallel:
   - Dual variables and slack variables 
   - Vehicle velocity and acceleration
   - Sampling time intervals
   - Vehicle states and controls
- The sub-problems are quadratic programs, second-order cone programs and sequential quadratic programs that can be solved robustly and efficiently.
- Additional variables and constraints linearize non-convex components.

Main Contributions:

- Accurate full-dimension vehicle and obstacle modeling
- Problem decomposition enables parallelized optimization 
- Sub-problems are selected specifically for efficient solving
- Removes need for warm starts, enhancing robustness
- Validation over hundreds of simulation and real-world test cases

Overall, OCEAN significantly advances the state-of-the-art in autonomous trajectory optimization, enabling accurate, efficient and robust planning essential for real-world automated parking systems.
