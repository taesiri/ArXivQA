## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous parking in dense and cluttered environments is challenging due to the need for efficient collision avoidance evaluation and real-time trajectory optimization. Existing methods have limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency or robustness. Specifically:

- Simplified obstacle representations (e.g. spheres) have low accuracy. 
- Safe corridor methods are too conservative.
- Mixed-integer programming formulations are intractable.  
- Whole-body collision checking methods only apply to convex shapes.  
- ESDF methods have high memory and computational requirements.

Overall, satisfying simultaneous requirements of accuracy, efficiency and robustness has remained an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes OCEAN - an optimization-based collision-avoidance trajectory planner accelerated by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Key aspects include:

- Collision avoidance constraints are reformulated into a convex dual form to enable efficient optimization. 
- The problem is decomposed via ADMM into sub-problems solved iteratively in parallel:
   - Dual variables and slack variables 
   - Vehicle velocity and acceleration
   - Sampling time intervals
   - Vehicle states and controls
- The sub-problems are quadratic programs, second-order cone programs and sequential quadratic programs that can be solved robustly and efficiently.
- Additional variables and constraints linearize non-convex components.

Main Contributions:

- Accurate full-dimension vehicle and obstacle modeling
- Problem decomposition enables parallelized optimization 
- Sub-problems are selected specifically for efficient solving
- Removes need for warm starts, enhancing robustness
- Validation over hundreds of simulation and real-world test cases

Overall, OCEAN significantly advances the state-of-the-art in autonomous trajectory optimization, enabling accurate, efficient and robust planning essential for real-world automated parking systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an optimization-based collision-free trajectory planner for autonomous parking called OCEAN that leverages ADMM parallelization to efficiently solve a convex reformulation of the planning problem and demonstrates improved computational performance over benchmark methods in simulations and real-world tests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper proposes OCEAN, an optimization-based collision-free trajectory planner for autonomous parking accelerated by ADMM. OCEAN has enhanced computational efficiency and robustness compared to other methods.

2. The trajectory planning problem is reformulated into a smooth, convex dual form and split into subproblems that can be solved efficiently in parallel using ADMM. The variables are carefully decomposed so the subproblems become QP, SOCP and SQP problems. 

3. Warm starting, which other methods rely heavily on, is not necessary in OCEAN. The dual variable collision avoidance subproblem is posed as a SOCP problem and iteratively solved.

4. Additional variables and constraints are introduced to linearize the nonlinear vehicle dynamics and collision avoidance constraints in the respective subproblems.

5. Extensive validations are performed in hundreds of simulation scenarios and hundreds of hours of real-world parking tests. The results demonstrate OCEAN has better performance than other benchmark methods in terms of efficiency, robustness and smoothness.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient, robust optimization-based trajectory planner for autonomous parking that leverages ADMM parallelization and careful problem decomposition. This enables real-time performance without reliance on warm starts.
