# [GPT-Calls: Enhancing Call Segmentation and Tagging by Generating   Synthetic Conversations via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07941)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can a novel method based on distilling knowledge from large language models like GPT-3 be developed to accurately segment and tag phone call transcripts, without requiring labeled training data? - Will this proposed method, referred to as GPT-Calls, outperform existing approaches like TextTiling, BERT-TSeg, and the previous greedy segmentation + summarization method used in Dynamics 365 Sales?- Can GPT-Calls provide an efficient and accurate solution for call segmentation and topic extraction that is versatile and applicable across domains?The key hypotheses seem to be:- By generating synthetic sentences for each topic using GPT-3 and extracting embeddings as topic anchors, GPT-Calls can accurately tag utterances in real transcripts with relevant topics.- By applying time domain analysis to the topic similarity scores, GPT-Calls can accurately segment the transcript into coherent sections associated with topics. - GPT-Calls will outperform other methods in call segmentation and topic extraction accuracy, particularly for sales call transcripts.- GPT-Calls will provide a robust and efficient solution without requiring labeled data, making it widely adaptable.In summary, the central research questions focus on whether the proposed GPT-Calls method can accurately perform call segmentation and topic tagging without labeled data, and whether it outperforms existing approaches, especially for sales call transcripts. The effectiveness and versatility of GPT-Calls is the key hypothesis.
