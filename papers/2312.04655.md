# [ECLIPSE: A Resource-Efficient Text-to-Image Prior for Image Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models like DALL-E 2 achieve state-of-the-art performance but require massive computational resources. Specifically, the "unCLIP" models used in DALL-E 2 employ a separate text-to-image prior module with over 1 billion parameters, greatly increasing model size and data requirements compared to Latent Diffusion Models. The key questions are whether this prior module contributes substantially to performance, or if simply scaling up model size is the reason for improved results. There is a need for more efficient unCLIP models.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes ECLIPSE, a novel contrastive learning strategy to train compact yet high-performing text-to-image prior models for the unCLIP framework. Specifically:

1) ECLIPSE trains non-diffusion prior models which are more parameter-efficient and converge faster than diffusion priors. Empirical analysis shows diffusion priors offer negligible benefits. 

2) A projection loss maps text embeddings to vision embeddings. However, this can lead to overfitting on the training distribution.

3) Contrastive learning with CLIP provides additional supervision by preserving semantic alignment between text and estimated image embeddings. This improves generalization.

4) The final ECLIPSE training objective balances projection and contrastive losses to estimate the vision distribution aligned with text semantics.

ECLIPSE trains 33M parameter priors using only 2.8% of the typical training data.

Contributions:

1) First use of contrastive learning to train text-to-image priors in unCLIP models.

2) State-of-the-art performance with 97% fewer parameters and 350x less training data.

3) Consistent improvements over baselines when using ECLIPSE with Karlo and Kandinsky decoders. 

4) Empirical analysis showing limitations of existing diffusion priors and benefits of contrastive learning.

In summary, ECLIPSE enables training highly performant unCLIP priors with tremendous reductions in model size and data needs. It shows promise for efficiently scaling up text-to-image generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new contrastive learning strategy called ECLIPSE to train a compact, parameter and data-efficient text-to-image prior model that achieves comparable performance to much larger state-of-the-art models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ECLIPSE, a novel contrastive learning strategy to improve the text-to-image (T2I) prior in the unCLIP framework. Specifically, ECLIPSE:

1) Introduces a way to utilize pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to provide additional supervision when training the T2I prior via contrastive learning. This improves generalization and reduces overfitting. 

2) Shows that much more compact (97% smaller) and parameter-efficient non-diffusion priors can be trained that rival the performance of much larger models, using only a fraction of the typical training data (as little as 2.8%).

3) Demonstrates through experiments that ECLIPSE priors consistently deliver high performance across datasets and decoders, outperforming baseline methods. Remakably, they achieve results on par with state-of-the-art models despite using only 3.3% as many parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting ECLIPSE as an effective and resource-efficient contrastive learning strategy to train high-performing text-to-image priors for the unCLIP framework. This significantly reduces the computational and data dependency of unCLIP models.

The paper introduces a new method called "ECLIPSE" to train more effective text-to-image priors for unCLIP models. The key ideas are using contrastive learning to distill knowledge from pre-trained vision-language models into small prior models, making training very parameter and data efficient. The method is evaluated on compositional text-to-image benchmarks and shown to achieve good performance while using only a fraction of the usual model size and training data.
