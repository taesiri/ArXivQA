# [Prediction of recurrence free survival of head and neck cancer using   PET/CT radiomics and clinical information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Head and neck cancer (HNC) has not seen improvement in 5-year survival rates over the past decade. A common cause of treatment failure and death is distance metastasis and secondary cancers. Identifying prognostic factors during diagnosis could help stratify patients into risk groups and improve treatment planning.

- Medical images like PET/CT scans contain quantitative information that could aid prognosis, known as radiomics features. This study explores using multimodal radiomics features from PET/CT scans along with clinical data to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HNC patients.

Proposed Solution:
- Extract radiomics features from primary tumor (GTVp) and lymph nodes (GTVn) in PET/CT scans. Use least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select features. Build Cox proportional hazard (CoxPH) models combining selected imaging features and clinical data to predict RFS.

- Study impact of segmentation accuracy on radiomics features through erosion (under-segmentation) and dilation (over-segmentation) of ground truth segmentation. Extract features from modified segmentations and evaluate prediction performance.

Key Contributions:
- Built novel multimodal model using PET/CT radiomics and clinical data to predict RFS in HNC patients. Model with both CT and PET features achieves best performance (C-index 0.74).

- One of first studies to evaluate effect of segmentation accuracy on predictive power of multimodal radiomics features for RFS prediction. PET features more sensitive to under-segmentation and CT features to over-segmentation. 

- Highlights the importance of tailored segmentation algorithms for multimodal imaging in radiomics studies. Findings suggest separate optimal segmentation for PET and CT scans could improve overall prediction performance.
