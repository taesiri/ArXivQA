# [DARLEI: Deep Accelerated Reinforcement Learning with Evolutionary   Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05171)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces DARLEI, a new framework that combines parallelized reinforcement learning powered by GPU-accelerated simulation with an asynchronous evolutionary algorithm for automated design and training of embodied agents. DARLEI leverages the UNIMAL morphology design space and tournament selection approach from the prior DERL system, while harnessing the speed and parallelism of Nvidia's Isaac Gym to achieve over 20x speedup on a single workstation compared to DERL's use of large distributed CPU clusters. Experiments characterize DARLEI's performance under various conditions, revealing it can effectively evolve locomotion behaviors but displays limitations in preserving diversity, with populations tending to converge over generations. The authors discuss mechanisms like multiobjective rewards, procedurally generated environments adhering to principles of Minimal Criterion Coevolution, and novelty search criteria that could promote more open-ended evolution in future work. While showing promise in efficiency gains for simulating embodied evolution, DARLEI requires further enhancements to capture the continuous innovation of natural evolutionary processes. Still, the power and accessibility unlocked by its GPU-acceleration could enable exciting new research at the intersection of evolutionary dynamics, emergent behaviors, and embodied intelligence.
