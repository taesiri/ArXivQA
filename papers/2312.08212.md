# [LAMM: Label Alignment for Multi-Modal Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08212)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel label alignment method called LAMM for effectively transferring pre-trained visual-language (VL) models like CLIP to downstream tasks. Existing methods focus mainly on designing prompt templates for the textual and visual inputs, while neglecting the gap between the label representations in VL models versus downstream datasets. LAMM introduces trainable label tokens that can automatically adjust the category embeddings through end-to-end optimization, aligning them better to the downstream tasks. To prevent overfitting on the limited downstream examples, a hierarchical loss is proposed comprising alignment in parameter space, feature space, and logits space. 

Experiments conducted on 11 image classification datasets demonstrate that LAMM significantly boosts the few-shot performance of CLIP and other prompting methods like CoOp and MaPLe. On 16-shot scenarios, LAMM shows average accuracy gains of 2.31% over state-of-the-art techniques. It also exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization capability. Unlike regular finetuning approaches, LAMM does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning settings. The method is generic and can be incorporated into existing prompting approaches for consistent improvements. Overall, the work provides valuable insights into label representation learning for effectively transferring VL models to various downstream applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a label alignment method named LAMM for multi-modal prompt learning, which replaces the class tokens in prompts with trainable vectors and aligns them to downstream tasks through a hierarchical loss over parameter, feature, and logits spaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a label alignment method named LAMM, which can dynamically adjust the category embeddings of downstream datasets through end-to-end training. Specifically:

1) LAMM introduces trainable vectors to replace label words in multi-modal prompts, in order to align label representations in downstream datasets with pre-trained vision-language models.

2) A hierarchical loss is proposed during training to preserve the generalization ability of the vision-language model. The hierarchical loss facilitates alignment of category representations among parameter, feature and logits spaces. 

3) Experiments on 11 downstream vision datasets demonstrate that LAMM significantly improves the performance of existing multi-modal prompt learning models in few-shot scenarios. It also exhibits advantages in domain generalization and continual learning.

4) LAMM is shown to be synergistic with existing prompt tuning methods and can further boost their performance.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed label alignment method LAMM that can better transfer pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks by bridging the gap in category representations.
