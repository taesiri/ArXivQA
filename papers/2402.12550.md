# [Multilinear Mixture of Experts: Scalable Expert Specialization through   Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture provides a powerful way to decompose dense neural network layers into smaller, more interpretable modules called "experts". However, a major limitation is that scaling up the number of experts for finer-grained specialization leads to prohibitively high computational costs. Existing sparse gating MoEs also have issues like training instability. 

Solution:
This paper proposes the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (MMoE) layer to address these issues. MMoEs perform implicit computation on factorized forms of huge weight tensors, avoiding materializing them. This allows scaling to thousands of experts without blowing up computation costs. MMoEs use tensor decompositions like Tucker, Tensor Train (TT) etc. to represent the huge weight tensor in factored form. The forward pass is done via efficient batched tensor contractions on these factors.

MMoEs avoid discrete routing of sparse MoEs, while being far cheaper than soft MoE alternatives. They readily generalize to multiple expert hierarchies using additional tensor dimensions. This provides greater expert specificity and total expert count.

Contributions:
1) Introduce MMoE layers that scale to huge numbers of experts via efficient batched tensor arithmetic on weight tensor factors 

2) Show qualitatively (visualization) and quantitatively (interventions) that increasing MMoE expert count leads to more specialized, semantic experts when fine-tuning vision models

3) Demonstrate expert specialization further enables manually editing models to address biases. Correct demographic bias in CelebA by rewriting specific expert combinations 

4) Establish MMoE image classification performance remains competitive with parameter-matched linear layers when used to fine-tune CLIP, DINO etc.

In summary, MMoEs facilitate increasingly performant yet interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy or fairness. The paper makes both theoretical contributions regarding connections of MoEs to bilinear layers, as well as empirical demonstrations of the practical utility of MMoEs.
