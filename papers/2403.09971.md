## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Advancing Object Goal Navigation Through LLM-enhanced Object Affinities Transfer":

Problem:
Object goal navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to target objects in scenes given their category labels. Existing methods either solely rely on training experiences, thus lacking adaptability to new environments, or directly employ large language models (LLMs) as agents, which is computationally expensive. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes the LLM-enhanced Object Affinities Transfer (LOAT) framework to integrate LLM-derived object semantics with network-based approaches. LOAT has two key modules:

1) Generalized affinities module: Uses LLM knowledge to identify objects semantically related to the target for better generalization. 

2) Experiential affinities module: Learns object relationships from training environments using scaled dot-product attention on text embeddings.

A dynamic fusion module balances these two sources based on context. The resulting affinity scores activate semantic maps fed into navigation policies.

Main Contributions:

- Integrates LLM commonsense knowledge with historical experiences in a cost-effective dual-module framework to enhance efficiency and generalization.

- Improves performance across metric and topological map-based policies in Habitat and AI2-THOR simulations, showing broad applicability.  

- Decouples target identification from environments by using pretrained text embeddings, ensuring adaptability to unseen objects.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on Habitat ObjectNav, ALFRED and SAVN-NAV benchmarks, validating efficacy in integrating LLM insights to advance object goal navigation.
