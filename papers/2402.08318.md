# [Explicit References to Social Values in Fairy Tales: A Comparison   between Three European Cultures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to study and compare the communication and representation of social values, such as benevolence, conformity, and universalism, in fairy tales from three European cultures - Portugal, Italy, and Germany. Specifically, it seeks to analyze if there are common European values conveyed across these fairy tale traditions using computational analysis. 

Methodology:
The authors use word embedding models to quantify vocabulary similarities and differences across the fairy tale corpora from the three countries. They specify a list of value-charged tokens based on Schwartz's theory of basic human values, consider their word stems, and analyze the semantic distances between these tokens using a bespoke pre-trained Word2Vec model. This allows them to compare the vector representations of values-related tokens across cultures.

The process involves:
(1) Selecting relevant fairy tale texts from the three countries 
(2) Identifying value-charged tokens and mapping them to Schwartz's values 
(3) Annotating the corpora by finding stem matches of the tokens  
(4) Creating a shared word embedding model and fine-tuning culture-specific versions
(5) Comparing semantic variation across cultures using the embeddings
(6) Validating results using historical and social analysis

Key Findings:
- The analysis reveals both similarities and differences in the manifestation of values across cultures. For instance, "faith" expresses loyalty in German tales, while in Italian and Portuguese tales, "piety" and "empathy" are clustered together.

- Despite variations, benevolence, conformity and universalism related tokens occur frequently across all three corpora, indicating a shared cultural understanding of these values. 

- The persistence of these values hints at the existence of a pan-European cultural memory conveyed through fairy tales.

Contributions:
- The paper presents a novel computational approach to analyze the communication of values in literary corpora across cultures. 

- It provides quantitative evidence for common European values persisting in fairy tales across Portuguese, Italian and German societies.

- The interdisciplinary methodology combining NLP and value theory analysis enriches digital humanities and comparative literary studies.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative computational technique to study values in texts and offers an analysis of fairy tales that reveals both cultural uniqueness and shared European values. The combined digital humanities and social science approach holds promise for comparative cultural studies.
