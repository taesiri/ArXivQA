# [Simple Imputation Rules for Prediction with Missing Data: Contrasting   Theoretical Guarantees with Empirical Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets. A common approach is to first impute the missing values and then train a predictive model on the imputed data (impute-then-regress).
- For inference tasks, the key assumption is that data is missing at random (MAR). However, prediction is different from inference and may not require this assumption. 

Main Contributions
- Provides a theoretical guarantee that impute-then-regress pipelines are asymptotically consistent for a broad class of imputation methods, without requiring the MAR assumption. Characterizes "optimal" imputation methods as those that encode missingness conspicuously.  
- Contrasts the theoretical results with extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic, semi-real, and real datasets. Key findings:
  - For categorical variables, mode imputation reduces accuracy compared to encoding missingness. Theory and experiments on synthetic/semi-real data support this.
  - For continuous variables, mean imputation performs as well as more complex methods on average. Relative performance depends on factors like missingness mechanism and fraction of missing values.
- Discusses limitations of theory and practice. Highlights gaps between them to guide future work regarding:
  - Relevance of MAR assumption for prediction
  - Interactions between imputation and prediction models
  - Need for realistic missing data generation models

In summary, the paper provides theory and extensive experiments on impute-then-regress pipelines. It shows simple imputation methods can work well for prediction, contrasts theory and practice, and provides insights to guide future missing data research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper studies the performance of impute-then-regress pipelines for prediction with missing data by contrasting theoretical guarantees showing the asymptotic consistency of simple imputation methods like mean imputation with empirical evidence from synthetic, semi-real, and real datasets which reveals more nuanced differences between simple and complex imputation approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions regarding the use of imputation methods for prediction with missing data.

On the theory side, the main contribution is a theorem showing that a broad class of imputation methods can lead to asymptotically consistent predictions, under mild conditions on the imputation function. In particular, the paper shows that "crude" imputation methods like mean imputation can be asymptotically optimal.

On the empirical side, the main contribution is an extensive numerical study contrasting the theoretical findings with the practical performance of different imputation methods, including mode imputation, mean imputation, and more complex iterative imputation. Using synthetic, semi-real, and real datasets, the authors find that:

- For categorical variables, the theory and experiments both show that encoding missingness as a separate category outperforms mode imputation. 

- For continuous variables, mean imputation performs remarkably well compared to more complex methods like mice, especially when the missing data fraction is high, supporting the theoretical results.

The paper also discusses limitations of the theory and gaps between theory and practice, highlighting opportunities for future work to better understand the complex interactions between imputation methods and predictive models in real-world finite sample settings.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms are:

- missing data
- imputation
- missing not at random
- censoring
- mean imputation
- mode imputation
- impute-then-regress
- consistency
- asymptotic optimality
- empirical performance
- synthetic data
- semi-real data
- real data

- NMAR (not missing at random)

The paper theoretically studies the consistency of impute-then-regress pipelines using different imputation methods like mean and mode imputation. It provides asymptotic guarantees and contrasts the theoretical results with empirical performance on synthetic, semi-real, and real datasets. Key concepts revolve around missing data assumptions like MAR and NMAR, simple imputation rules, and understanding if they can lead to consistent predictions in practice or not.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a theorem (Theorem 1) that characterizes the asymptotic consistency of generic imputation rules for prediction. What are the key assumptions behind this theorem and what insights does it provide regarding what makes an "optimal" imputation rule?

2) The paper theoretically shows that mode imputation is inconsistent for categorical variables, while encoding missingness as a separate category leads to consistency. What is the intuition behind this result? How is it supported by the empirical evidence presented?

3) For continuous variables, the paper shows theoretically that mean imputation can lead to consistency. What are the mechanics behind this result? What empirical evidence supports or contradicts this theoretical finding? 

4) The empirical results show some gaps between the theoretical guarantees and practical performance, especially on real datasets. What are some potential explanations proposed in the paper for these gaps? How might these gaps guide future research?

5) The paper discusses how the MAR assumption may not be the right distinction to make for prediction tasks with missing data. What alternative taxonomies does it propose? What examples illustrate cases where NMAR missingness can improve predictive performance?

6) What empirical analysis is done regarding the complex interactions between the imputation model and the downstream predictive model? What insights does this provide into model selection for impute-then-regress pipelines?

7) How does the paper generate synthetic data for missing values? What are some limitations discussed of common synthetic data generation processes for missing data? How might more realistic data generation models be developed?

8) What variants for imputation followed by regression are discussed? What recommendations does the paper make based on the empirical analysis of these variants?

9) How does the paper generate signals $Y$ in the semi-real and real-world design matrix experiments? What different missingness mechanisms are induced between $Y$, $\bm{X}$ and $\bm{M}$?

10) What evaluation methodology does the paper propose for comparing impute-then-regress pipelines? How does this methodology account for variability across datasets and runs?
