# [Simple Imputation Rules for Prediction with Missing Data: Contrasting   Theoretical Guarantees with Empirical Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets. A common approach is to first impute the missing values and then train a predictive model on the imputed data (impute-then-regress).
- For inference tasks, the key assumption is that data is missing at random (MAR). However, prediction is different from inference and may not require this assumption. 

Main Contributions
- Provides a theoretical guarantee that impute-then-regress pipelines are asymptotically consistent for a broad class of imputation methods, without requiring the MAR assumption. Characterizes "optimal" imputation methods as those that encode missingness conspicuously.  
- Contrasts the theoretical results with extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic, semi-real, and real datasets. Key findings:
  - For categorical variables, mode imputation reduces accuracy compared to encoding missingness. Theory and experiments on synthetic/semi-real data support this.
  - For continuous variables, mean imputation performs as well as more complex methods on average. Relative performance depends on factors like missingness mechanism and fraction of missing values.
- Discusses limitations of theory and practice. Highlights gaps between them to guide future work regarding:
  - Relevance of MAR assumption for prediction
  - Interactions between imputation and prediction models
  - Need for realistic missing data generation models

In summary, the paper provides theory and extensive experiments on impute-then-regress pipelines. It shows simple imputation methods can work well for prediction, contrasts theory and practice, and provides insights to guide future missing data research.
