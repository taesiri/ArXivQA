## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- RGB-D saliency detection aims to detect salient objects using both RGB images and depth information. It has wide applications in computer vision.
- Designing an effective multiscale CNN for RGB-D saliency detection is challenging due to large model size and the difficulty in fusing features across scales.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Saliency Enhanced Feature Fusion (SEFF) module to fuse features of RGB, depth and across scales. 
- SEFF utilizes saliency maps of neighboring scales to enhance the features before fusion, making the fused features more representative.  
- A multiscale RGB-D saliency detector called SEFFsal is proposed using SEFF. It processes images at 3 scales and uses SEFF for both RGB-D fusion and cross-scale fusion.

Main Contributions:
- An effective Saliency Enhanced Feature Fusion (SEFF) module that fuses features using guidance from saliency maps.
- A multiscale RGB-D salient object detection network called SEFFsal built using the proposed SEFF module.
- Extensive experiments showing SEFFsal outperforms 10 state-of-the-art methods on 5 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

In summary, the paper proposed a novel feature fusion strategy for multiscale RGB-D salient object detection that utilizes saliency guidance to enhance fusion. A multiscale detection network is built using this technique and shown to achieve new state-of-the-art results.
