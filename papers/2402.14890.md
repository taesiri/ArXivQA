# [Vygotsky Distance: Measure for Benchmark Task Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Modern NLP benchmarks consist of arbitrary sets of tasks that neither guarantee generalization potential nor try to minimize resource consumption for model evaluation. 
- There is a need for quantitative methods to rigorously measure similarity between benchmark tasks and generalization potential.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new metric called "Vygotsky distance" to measure similarity between two benchmark tasks based on relative performance of models on those tasks. 
- Represent an NLP benchmark as a weighted undirected graph with tasks as vertices and Vygotsky distance as edge weights.
- Use graph representation for benchmark compression - select a small subset of tasks that can predict performance on the remaining tasks.
- Compression rate of 40% allows predicting performance on held-out tasks with 80% accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Formalism to represent NLP benchmarks as graphs and analyze structural properties.
- Vygotsky distance metric to quantify similarity of tasks based on relative model performance.
- Algorithm for benchmark compression by selecting a subset of tasks that predict performance on remaining tasks.
- Analysis of benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE etc. showing 50% tasks are redundant.
- Framework for model evaluation on smaller benchmark subsets, saving computational resources.
- Insights into generalization ability and directions for constructing new diverse tasks by analyzing graph representations.

In summary, the paper introduces a formal graph representation and a learner-centric metric to analyze similarity of benchmark NLP tasks. This allows compressing existing benchmarks significantly while retaining evaluation capacity. The analysis also provides insights into model generalization potential and directions for constructing new and diverse tasks.
