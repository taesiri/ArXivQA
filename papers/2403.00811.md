# [Cognitive Bias in High-Stakes Decision-Making with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like cognitive biases which can implicitly mislead users during decision-making. This is concerning for high-stakes scenarios like evaluating individuals. 
- Evaluating and mitigating cognitive bias is challenging due to the lack of assessment tools and the complexity of biases.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose BiasBuster, a framework to systematically evaluate and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs.

- For evaluation, they develop a dataset of 16,800 prompts that test for various cognitive biases like anchoring, framing, group attribution etc. Metrics are designed to quantify bias.

- For mitigation, they test debiasing strategies like making models self-aware of bias, contrastive examples, counterfactual examples and a new "self-help" method where models rewrite their own prompts to reduce bias.

Main Contributions:  
- Comprehensive analysis of cognitive bias in major LLMs using specifically designed evaluation prompts and metrics
- Demonstration that models exhibit various biases like primacy bias, framing bias etc. which can significantly impact decisions
- Introduction of a "self-help" debiasing approach where models autonomously rewrite biased prompts, showing ability of models to self-improve
- Systematic assessment of different debiasing strategies for mitigating cognitive bias in LLMs to enable fairer decision-making

The paper provides pivotal insights and techniques to audit LLMs for implicit cognitive biases and improve model fairness, accountability and reliability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes BiasBuster, a framework to systematically evaluate and mitigate cognitive bias in large language models (LLMs), especially for high-stakes decision-making tasks. 

2. It develops a dataset with over 16,800 prompts to test various types of cognitive biases in LLMs, including prompt-induced, sequential, and inherent biases.

3. It compares different debiasing strategies such as awareness, contrastive examples, counterfactual examples, and a novel self-help debiasing method where the LLM tries to de-bias its own prompts.

4. It provides a comprehensive analysis of cognitive biases and debiasing capabilities across different commercial and open-source LLMs. 

5. It shows that the proposed self-help debiasing approach can effectively mitigate certain cognitive biases without requiring manually crafted debiasing examples.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards auditing and mitigating human-like cognitive biases in LLMs to improve fairness and explainability, especially for high-stakes decision support scenarios. The analysis and proposed methods pave the way for developing less biased and more reliable AI systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Cognitive bias - refers to systematic patterns of deviation from rationality in judgment, where individuals (or models) create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of inputs. The paper focuses on evaluating and mitigating cognitive biases in language models.

- High-stakes decision-making - the paper examines cognitive bias in the context of language models providing decision support/recommendations in important, impactful scenarios like evaluating individuals.

- Bias mitigation techniques - the paper discusses and compares different techniques to mitigate cognitive bias, like contrastive examples, counterfactual examples, and a novel "self-help" method. 

- Prompt engineering - the creation of testing prompts to evaluate different cognitive biases, and debiasing prompts to mitigate biases, is a focus of the methodology.

- Anchoring bias, Framing bias, Primacy bias, Status quo bias, Group attribution bias - specific cognitive biases analyzed in the language models.

- Model self-consistency, decision confidence, admission rates - some of the key metrics and measurements used to evaluate the presence/extent of cognitive biases.

- Commercial models like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 - state-of-the-art large language models evaluated. 

So in summary, the key terms cover cognitive biases, bias testing/mitigation, prompt engineering, specific bias types examined, evaluation metrics, and the language models analyzed. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed \ours framework capture the different types of cognitive biases (prompt-induced, sequential, inherent) in LLMs? What novel techniques are used?

2. The concept of self-help debiasing is introduced in the paper. Explain this approach and how it enables models to autonomously rewrite their own prompts to mitigate bias. What are the advantages compared to other debiasing strategies?  

3. Discuss the metrics and quantitative evaluations performed in the paper to assess the presence of different cognitive biases. How are concepts from cognitive science translated to evaluate LLMs?

4. Explain the student admission testbed used in the paper. Why is this an appropriate high-stakes scenario for evaluating cognitive biases? How are synthetic student profiles generated?  

5. Analyze the experimental results on inherent cognitive biases like primacy bias. How does the self-help strategy compare to contrastive and counterfactual approaches in balancing option selections?

6. The paper finds commercial models like GPT-3.5 exhibit lower rates of changing decisions for anchoring bias. Analyze why high capacity leads to greater consistency. How should lower capacity models be debiased?

7. Discuss the failure cases observed when using contrastive and counterfactual debiasing. Why do minor prompt deviations confuse models and undermine following instructions correctly?

8. Explain why self-help allows models to handle a variety of cognitive biases through a generalized process. How does it reduce the need for manually tailored bias examples?

9. Analyze the limitations of current models regarding self-help and their ability to fully remove biased prompt components. How can capabilities be advanced in future work?  

10. Discuss ethical concerns andIntended use cases for the cognitive bias dataset introduced in this work. What precautions are advised regarding potential misuse?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces BiasBuster, a framework to systematically uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive biases in large language models to support fair and explainable decision-making when using LLMs for assistance.
