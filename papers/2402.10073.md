# [Both Matter: Enhancing the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language   Models without Compromising the General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10073)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Current large language models (LLMs) used as conversational AI assistants lack comprehensive emotional intelligence (EI). Prior works have focused narrowly on improving emotion perception via fine-tuning, leading to incomplete EI enhancement and catastrophic forgetting of general intelligence (GI).  

- There is a need to enhance all aspects of EI (emotion perception, cognition, expression) without compromising the LLMs' GI (world knowledge, general/commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension).

Solution - MoEI:
- Proposes EiBench, a large-scale collection of EI tasks covering all 3 EI aspects to support comprehensive EI enhancement. 

- Presents Modular Emotional Intelligence enhancement method (MoEI) with two key techniques:
   - Modular Parameter Expansion: Expands model capacity with a Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLoRA) architecture to accommodate EI knowledge.
   - Intra-Inter Modulation: Performs weighted modulation within MoLoRA blocks (intra) and between MoLoRA & LLM backbone (inter) to handle EI/GI inputs.

- MoEI enhances EI by updating only the EI-specific MoLoRA while preserving GI in LLM backbone via inter-modulation.

Main Contributions:
- First work studying enhancement of LLM assistants' EI without compromising GI, an important direction.

- Introduces EiBench to support comprehensive EI improvement of LLMs. 

- Proposes effective MoEI method that modularly expands LLM capacity and performs intra-inter modulation to improve EI while maintaining GI.

- Experiments show MoEI significantly enhances all 3 EI aspects and preserves 4 GI dimensions across varying LLM architectures/scales.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel method called MoEI to comprehensively enhance the emotional intelligence of large language models without compromising their general intelligence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It takes the first step to study how to develop an LLM-based assistant that possesses both high general intelligence (GI) and high emotional intelligence (EI), which is a challenging but important direction for better application of LLMs. 

2) It introduces EiBench, a comprehensive collection of EI-related tasks to support the EI enhancement of LLM backbones. 

3) It proposes a novel method called MoEI (Modular Emotional Intelligence Enhancing Method) to effectively improve the EI of LLM backbones without compromising their GI. MoEI consists of two collaborative techniques - Modular Parameter Expansion and Intra-Inter Modulation.

4) Experiments on various EI and GI benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoEI in enhancing EI while maintaining GI performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective method (MoEI) to enhance EI of LLMs while preserving their GI, which is validated through comprehensive experiments. EiBench is also introduced to facilitate EI enhancement research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel Modular Emotional Intelligence enhancement method (MoEI). What are the two key techniques used in MoEI and how do they work together to improve emotional intelligence while preserving general intelligence?

2. MoEI uses a Modular Parameter Expansion technique. Explain what this involves and why a modular design was chosen over other parameter efficient tuning methods. What are the advantages of this approach?

3. What is the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLoRA) architecture used in the modular parameter expansion? How does it build upon and extend standard LoRA tuning?

4. Explain the concept of Intra-Modulation in MoEI. How does it allow flexible weighting and combination of different expanded modules on the model?

5. What is Inter-Modulation in MoEI and what role does it play? How does it help to preserve the general intelligence capabilities of the foundation LLM? 

6. The authors use a dataset called EiBench for training and evaluation. What are the key characteristics and components of this dataset? Why was it necessary to construct it?

7. MoEI is evaluated on two foundation LLMs - Flan-T5 and LLaMA-2-Chat. Analyze and compare the EI and GI results achieved by MoEI on these two models. What insights do the results provide?

8. How does the performance of MoEI compare to other methods like fine-tuning and LoRA tuning? What are the limitations of these other approaches that MoEI is able to overcome?

9. The ablation study analyzes the impact of different components of MoEI. Discuss the key findings and what they demonstrate about the modular expansion and modulation techniques.

10. The authors demonstrate MoEI's ability to improve performance on out-of-distribution tasks using EmotionPrompt. Explain this concept and discuss how enhanced EI can benefit other downstream capabilities.
