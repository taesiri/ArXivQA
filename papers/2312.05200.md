# [DelucionQA: Detecting Hallucinations in Domain-specific Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05200)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of a new dataset called \datasetName for facilitating research on hallucination detection in domain-specific question answering systems that use information retrieval and large language models. The dataset contains over 2,000 human-labeled examples of question-answer pairs along with the retrieved context, annotated for whether hallucination occurs.

2. A set of proposed baseline methods for automatically detecting hallucinated content in the answers. These include similarity-based approaches using sentence embeddings and keyword overlap as well as a keyword extraction method.

3. An analysis of the causes and types of hallucinations that can occur even when using information retrieval, as well as discussion of insights gained from the dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is the new dataset to enable further research, along with some initial benchmark methods and qualitative analysis around the problem of hallucination detection in retrieval-augmented QA.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a paragraph summarizing key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new dataset called DelucionQA for detecting hallucinations in answers generated by retrieval-augmented language models for domain-specific question answering. The dataset contains over 2,000 human-labeled question-answer pairs related to car repair manuals, indicating whether the answer contains hallucinated content. The paper proposes the dataset to facilitate research into ensuring reliability for customer-facing AI assistants that provide technical support. Baseline methods for automatically detecting hallucinated answers are provided, including approaches based on sentence similarity to retrieved context and keyword matching. Analysis of different types of hallucinations in the dataset highlights reasons models still hallucinate even when provided relevant context, like relying more on their parametric knowledge and inability to fully capture all relevant information. The best baseline method achieves only mediocre accuracy, showing ample room for improvement on this challenging new task with valuable applications in making AI assistants more reliable.
