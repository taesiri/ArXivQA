# [CLAMS: A Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Estimating Perceptual Variability   in Visual Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0284)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we automatically and efficiently estimate the variability in how people visually perceive clusters (i.e. cluster ambiguity) in monochrome scatterplots?The key points are:- The paper focuses on studying perceptual variability in how people conduct visual clustering of data points in scatterplots. This is referred to as "cluster ambiguity."- There is currently no systematic way to estimate this cluster ambiguity. Doing so typically requires extensive and tedious collection of human perceptual data on clustering scatterplots. - The paper introduces a new data-driven visual quality measure called CLAMS that can automatically predict cluster ambiguity for a given monochrome scatterplot.- CLAMS aims to estimate the potential inter-subject differences people may have in visibly identifying clusters in the same scatterplot.- The model is trained on human annotated perceptual data of cluster separability. It then aggregates predictions across all pairwise cluster separabilities to estimate overall ambiguity.- CLAMS outperforms clustering algorithms and exhibits comparable performance to human annotators in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity.So in summary, the key research question is how to efficiently estimate the variability in human visual cluster perception (cluster ambiguity) for scatterplots, which CLAMS aims to solve as an automated visual quality measure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new measure called CLAMS (Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Scatterplots) to quantify the ambiguity in visual clustering of scatterplots. 2. It presents a data-driven approach to automatically predict cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots using CLAMS. The measure uses a regression module to estimate the human-judged separability of clusters and aggregates the results to quantify ambiguity.3. It demonstrates that CLAMS outperforms common clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity and exhibits comparable performance to human annotators.4. It shows applications of CLAMS for benchmarking and optimizing data mining techniques.In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and evaluation of CLAMS, a novel visual quality measure to automatically predict the perceptual variability/ambiguity in conducting visual clustering of scatterplots. This measure could be useful for evaluating and improving scatterplot visualizations and associated data mining techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on estimating perceptual variability in visual clustering of scatterplots:- It introduces a new data-driven visual quality measure called CLAMS (Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Scatterplots) to automatically predict cluster ambiguity. Most prior work relies on human judgments or clustering algorithms rather than a specialized quality measure.- The measure is trained on a dataset of human judgments about cluster separability, allowing it to better capture perceptual factors than unsupervised clustering algorithms.- It focuses specifically on cluster ambiguity as a measure of potential disagreement in visual cluster perception. Related work often looks at visual cluster quality more broadly.  - Evaluations compare performance to both human judgments and clustering algorithms. Many papers focus just on correlation to algorithms or use less direct evaluations.- Applications are demonstrated for benchmarking and optimizing data mining techniques. This showcases the utility beyond just predicting ambiguity.- The work centers on monochrome scatterplots specifically. Related measures sometimes target different plot types.Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in terms of a data-driven measure targeting cluster ambiguity. The human-based data and evaluations help validate that it captures perceptual factors well. The applications also showcase uses for optimization and benchmarking algorithms.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing specific applications and case studies using Cluster Ambiguity Measure (CLAMS) to demonstrate its usefulness for tasks like benchmarking clustering algorithms, designing better visualization systems, and providing warnings about unreliable cluster structures. The authors mention possibilities like using CLAMS for adaptive clustering algorithms and progressive visual analytics.- Extending CLAMS to handle additional plot types beyond monochrome scatterplots, such as other multivariate data plots like parallel coordinates or heatmaps. The authors note the perceptual study results may transfer to some extent.- Conducting further studies on the connection between perceptual ambiguity, measured by CLAMS, and cognitive load or sensemaking outcomes. The authors suggest perception and cognition are intertwined and should be studied together.- Exploring ways to communicate insights from CLAMS, such as cluster ambiguity levels, directly to users as warnings or guidance within visualization tools and systems.- Developing enhanced versions of the regression model within CLAMS using larger crowdsourced datasets or additional cluster features beyond the current set that focus on proximity and density.- Studying individual differences in conducting visual clustering tasks and whether factors like visual analytic skill or domain knowledge influence cluster ambiguity perceptions.So in summary, the authors lay out several interesting avenues to validate, extend, refine, and apply CLAMS in different ways that could make important contributions to future research on understanding and supporting visual clustering activities.
