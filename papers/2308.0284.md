# [CLAMS: A Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Estimating Perceptual Variability   in Visual Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0284)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we automatically and efficiently estimate the variability in how people visually perceive clusters (i.e. cluster ambiguity) in monochrome scatterplots?The key points are:- The paper focuses on studying perceptual variability in how people conduct visual clustering of data points in scatterplots. This is referred to as "cluster ambiguity."- There is currently no systematic way to estimate this cluster ambiguity. Doing so typically requires extensive and tedious collection of human perceptual data on clustering scatterplots. - The paper introduces a new data-driven visual quality measure called CLAMS that can automatically predict cluster ambiguity for a given monochrome scatterplot.- CLAMS aims to estimate the potential inter-subject differences people may have in visibly identifying clusters in the same scatterplot.- The model is trained on human annotated perceptual data of cluster separability. It then aggregates predictions across all pairwise cluster separabilities to estimate overall ambiguity.- CLAMS outperforms clustering algorithms and exhibits comparable performance to human annotators in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity.So in summary, the key research question is how to efficiently estimate the variability in human visual cluster perception (cluster ambiguity) for scatterplots, which CLAMS aims to solve as an automated visual quality measure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new measure called CLAMS (Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Scatterplots) to quantify the ambiguity in visual clustering of scatterplots. 2. It presents a data-driven approach to automatically predict cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots using CLAMS. The measure uses a regression module to estimate the human-judged separability of clusters and aggregates the results to quantify ambiguity.3. It demonstrates that CLAMS outperforms common clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity and exhibits comparable performance to human annotators.4. It shows applications of CLAMS for benchmarking and optimizing data mining techniques.In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and evaluation of CLAMS, a novel visual quality measure to automatically predict the perceptual variability/ambiguity in conducting visual clustering of scatterplots. This measure could be useful for evaluating and improving scatterplot visualizations and associated data mining techniques.
