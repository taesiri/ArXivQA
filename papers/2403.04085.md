# [Don't Blame the Data, Blame the Model: Understanding Noise and Bias When   Learning from Subjective Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work has raised concerns about potential harms from aggregating labels in subjective annotation tasks where there are inherent disagreements among human annotators. 
- Existing automated data evaluation methods like Data Maps define noise based on models trained on aggregated labels, showing low confidence on high-disagreement instances. 
- This paper investigates whether low model confidence correlates with human disagreement on instances, and whether learning from raw annotations instead of aggregates improves confidence.

Methods:
- Use 3 toxicity detection datasets with raw annotations and measure human disagreement via annotator agreement. 
- Train Single-GT models on aggregated majority vote labels. Measure model confidence and variability over epochs with Data Maps. 
- Train Multi-GT model (DisCo) on raw annotations, adapting Data Maps to measure confidence and variability per annotation.

Results:
- Strong correlation between human disagreement and low Single-GT model confidence.
- Overall, DisCo also shows higher confidence when annotations agree with majority, lower for disagrees.
- But for Single-GT low confidence instances, DisCo shows higher confidence on minority disagrees.
- Suggests Multi-GT models can extract useful signals from subjective tasks that Single-GT models miss.

Contributions:
- Shows low confidence instances in Single-GT models are not necessarily unusable mislabels.
- Demonstrates Multi-GT models' effectiveness in learning from raw annotations, even minority ones discarded during aggregation.
- Advocates for modeling approaches that preserve multiple perspectives in subjective tasks.

Let me know if you need any part of the summary expanded or clarified further.
