# [Adaptive morphing of wing and tail for stable, resilient, and   energy-efficient flight of avian-informed drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Avian-informed drones have morphing wing and tail surfaces that make them more agile and energy efficient compared to fixed-wing drones. However, their complex design with many controllable degrees of freedom poses challenges for control systems due to coupling effects between actuators, state dependencies, and interactions between joint actuators. Existing control strategies either rely on human pilots or use simplified approaches that do not fully leverage the capabilities of avian-informed drones.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new body-rate controller that maps desired body rates to appropriate deflections of all available morphing actuators, accounting for their couplings, state dependencies and interactions. This enables closed-loop control to track desired body rates. The method is applied to an avian-informed drone called LisEagle with 8 controllable degrees of freedom.

Key Contributions:

- The proposed controller leverages all available actuators to control the drone's motion, making it resilient to disturbances. Experiments show stable flight under physical perturbations, turbulent airflow, and even loss of certain actuators.

- The controller's overactuated nature is leveraged to explore efficient wing and tail configurations at different speeds using in-flight Bayesian optimization. The optimized configurations significantly improve energy efficiency by 4.4-11.5% compared to non-morphing configurations.

- The resulting configurations at different speeds resemble those used by birds, validating bioinspired principles. Lower wing sweep and higher twist are more efficient at higher speeds.

- The work provides a foundation for fully autonomous avian-informed drones that can fly energy efficiently in diverse conditions by leveraging morphing.

In summary, the key innovation is a control strategy that uniquely exploits the complex morphing capacities of bioinspired drones both for resilience and energy efficiency, enabling their autonomous operation.
