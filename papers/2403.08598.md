# [Adaptive morphing of wing and tail for stable, resilient, and   energy-efficient flight of avian-informed drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Avian-informed drones have morphing wing and tail surfaces that make them more agile and energy efficient compared to fixed-wing drones. However, their complex design with many controllable degrees of freedom poses challenges for control systems due to coupling effects between actuators, state dependencies, and interactions between joint actuators. Existing control strategies either rely on human pilots or use simplified approaches that do not fully leverage the capabilities of avian-informed drones.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new body-rate controller that maps desired body rates to appropriate deflections of all available morphing actuators, accounting for their couplings, state dependencies and interactions. This enables closed-loop control to track desired body rates. The method is applied to an avian-informed drone called LisEagle with 8 controllable degrees of freedom.

Key Contributions:

- The proposed controller leverages all available actuators to control the drone's motion, making it resilient to disturbances. Experiments show stable flight under physical perturbations, turbulent airflow, and even loss of certain actuators.

- The controller's overactuated nature is leveraged to explore efficient wing and tail configurations at different speeds using in-flight Bayesian optimization. The optimized configurations significantly improve energy efficiency by 4.4-11.5% compared to non-morphing configurations.

- The resulting configurations at different speeds resemble those used by birds, validating bioinspired principles. Lower wing sweep and higher twist are more efficient at higher speeds.

- The work provides a foundation for fully autonomous avian-informed drones that can fly energy efficiently in diverse conditions by leveraging morphing.

In summary, the key innovation is a control strategy that uniquely exploits the complex morphing capacities of bioinspired drones both for resilience and energy efficiency, enabling their autonomous operation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new body-rate control method for drones with morphing wings and tails that maps actuator positions to desired motion, enabling stable flight despite disturbances and optimized energy efficiency through in-flight configuration adaptation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new body-rate controller for avian-informed drones that leverages all available actuators and degrees of freedom to control the motion of the drone. Specifically:

- They develop a mapping between desired body rates and control surface deflections that accounts for the complex dynamics and interactions of an avian-informed drone's morphing wing and tail surfaces. This enables closed-loop control over all degrees of freedom.

- They demonstrate this controller allows stable flight against wind and perturbations, can compensate for loss of some actuators, and rejects external disturbances like asymmetric wind gusts.

- They show the controller's overactuated nature can be leveraged to explore wing/tail configurations for maximizing energy efficiency. Bayesian optimization efficiently searches the configuration space in-flight to identify designs resembling birds of similar size/mass. 

- The proposed ideas provide a foundation for developing fully autonomous avian-informed drones that can fly stably and efficiently by adapting their morphology to diverse conditions. This highlights the benefits of bioinspired morphing aerial vehicles.

In summary, the key contribution is a generalized control strategy to unlock the agility and adaptability of drones with extensively morphing wings/tails in changing flight conditions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new body-rate controller for avian-informed drones. How does this controller account for the coupling effects, state dependencies, and interdependent actuation compared to traditional controllers?

2. The mapping matrix is recalculated during flight to capture state dependencies. What is the rationale behind choosing a recalculation rate of 10 Hz? What tradeoffs does this introduce between computational load and accuracy? 

3. What modifications were made to the standard cascaded PID control strategy to enable tailored tuning for each actuator? Why is this important for systems with inertia-heavy control surfaces?  

4. The paper argues that acceleration-based controllers like INDI are impractical for avian-informed drones. Why do momentary torques caused by control surface inertia pose challenges for these methods?

5. How was the Bayesian Optimization algorithm initialized and what measures were taken to prevent the integrator from slowly overwriting the optimal configurations found during the search?

6. The paper demonstrates resilience to loss of actuation authority during flight. Why does losing control of the tail sweep lead to unstable behavior specifically at higher speeds?  

7. What sensing capabilities would need to be added to deploy the proposed control method outdoors where wind conditions are more unpredictable?

8. The energy-efficient configurations found through Bayesian Optimization resemble behaviors seen in birds. What similarities are noted in the paper and how do they change with airspeed?

9. In what ways could the dynamics model be further improved to address discrepancies seen between model predictions and real-world measurements?

10. How was the control method first tested in simulation before deployment on the real drone? What measures were taken to enable extensive real-world testing without damage or crashes?
