# Controlling Personality Style in Dialogue with Zero-Shot Prompt-Based   Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How well can prompt-based learning control both personality style and semantic accuracy in natural language generation for dialog?The key points are:- The paper explores using prompt-based learning to generate text that is both semantically accurate (conveys the correct meaning) and stylistically controlled (exhibits a specified personality) for dialog systems. - This is tested on the Personage dataset, which has utterances exhibiting different Big 5 personality types, as well as on the ViGGO video game dataset.- Two prompt formats are compared: Data-to-Text (D2T) prompts that demonstrate generating directly from meaning representations, and Textual Style Transfer (TST) prompts that convert the meaning representation to text first.- Performance is measured using automatic metrics for semantic accuracy, personality match, and fluency. - Ranking candidate outputs is shown to greatly improve results over single outputs.- The central hypothesis is that prompt-based learning can effectively control both style and semantics for NLG when using the right prompt format, tuning, and ranking. The results generally support this on the datasets tested.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing and evaluating prompt-based learning methods for simultaneously controlling both the personality style and semantic accuracy of natural language generation for dialogues. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Comparing two types of prompts for controlling personality style and semantics in NLG: data-to-text prompts that demonstrate generating directly from meaning representations, vs textual style transfer prompts that convert meaning representations to pseudo-references first.- Showing that textual style transfer prompts achieve higher semantic and stylistic accuracy compared to data-to-text prompts. - Testing different prompt sampling strategies, including using a diversity criteria for selecting examples, and showing that diversity improves accuracy.- Evaluating different ranking functions using automatic metrics for semantic accuracy, personality match, and fluency. The best performing ranking achieves 78.46% semantic accuracy and 100% personality accuracy.- Demonstrating surprise finding of being able to transfer personality style from restaurant domain prompts to video game domain meaning representations, achieving 87.6% semantic accuracy and 97% personality accuracy.- Comparing to prior work on semantic and stylistic control, this is the first to test prompt-based learning for jointly optimizing semantics and style in NLG.In summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating prompt-based methods to simultaneously control personality style and semantic accuracy in NLG by comparing prompt formats, sampling strategies, ranking functions and cross-domain transfer. The results significantly advance prompt-based controllable NLG.
