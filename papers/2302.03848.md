# Controlling Personality Style in Dialogue with Zero-Shot Prompt-Based   Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How well can prompt-based learning control both personality style and semantic accuracy in natural language generation for dialog?The key points are:- The paper explores using prompt-based learning to generate text that is both semantically accurate (conveys the correct meaning) and stylistically controlled (exhibits a specified personality) for dialog systems. - This is tested on the Personage dataset, which has utterances exhibiting different Big 5 personality types, as well as on the ViGGO video game dataset.- Two prompt formats are compared: Data-to-Text (D2T) prompts that demonstrate generating directly from meaning representations, and Textual Style Transfer (TST) prompts that convert the meaning representation to text first.- Performance is measured using automatic metrics for semantic accuracy, personality match, and fluency. - Ranking candidate outputs is shown to greatly improve results over single outputs.- The central hypothesis is that prompt-based learning can effectively control both style and semantics for NLG when using the right prompt format, tuning, and ranking. The results generally support this on the datasets tested.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing and evaluating prompt-based learning methods for simultaneously controlling both the personality style and semantic accuracy of natural language generation for dialogues. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Comparing two types of prompts for controlling personality style and semantics in NLG: data-to-text prompts that demonstrate generating directly from meaning representations, vs textual style transfer prompts that convert meaning representations to pseudo-references first.- Showing that textual style transfer prompts achieve higher semantic and stylistic accuracy compared to data-to-text prompts. - Testing different prompt sampling strategies, including using a diversity criteria for selecting examples, and showing that diversity improves accuracy.- Evaluating different ranking functions using automatic metrics for semantic accuracy, personality match, and fluency. The best performing ranking achieves 78.46% semantic accuracy and 100% personality accuracy.- Demonstrating surprise finding of being able to transfer personality style from restaurant domain prompts to video game domain meaning representations, achieving 87.6% semantic accuracy and 97% personality accuracy.- Comparing to prior work on semantic and stylistic control, this is the first to test prompt-based learning for jointly optimizing semantics and style in NLG.In summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating prompt-based methods to simultaneously control personality style and semantic accuracy in NLG by comparing prompt formats, sampling strategies, ranking functions and cross-domain transfer. The results significantly advance prompt-based controllable NLG.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper explores using prompt-based learning to generate text that simultaneously controls both personality style and semantic accuracy for dialog systems, finding that textual style transfer prompts work better than data-to-text prompts and that ranking outputs improves results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research in the field of controllable natural language generation:- This paper focuses on using prompt-based learning methods for stylistic control, while most prior work on controllable NLG uses fine-tuning. Prompt-based learning is a newer technique that has shown promise for fast adaptation, so applying it to style control is novel. - The paper aims to control both semantics and style simultaneously, while much prior work focuses on one or the other. Controlling both well is challenging, so testing prompt methods on this combined task advances the state of the art.- The paper experiments with different prompt design strategies, including data-to-text and textual style transfer formats. Comparing prompt design choices systematically is an important contribution. - The paper tests transferring stylistic control across domains, from restaurants to video games, which is a highly novel test of generalization. Most style transfer research stays within a single domain.- The persona-based stylistic dimensions explored are based on psychology, unlike many style transfer papers that use simpler lexical manipulations. Testing on linguistically motivated styles is more rigorous.- The paper uses specialized semantic accuracy metrics for the two domains based on slot error rates, while much style transfer work uses only n-gram overlap metrics like BLEU which can be misleading.Overall, this paper makes several strong contributions over prior work by rigorously testing prompt-based learning for joint semantic and stylistic control, examining prompt design choices, and evaluating cross-domain generalization as well as use of linguistically motivated style dimensions and specialized semantic accuracy metrics. The experiments significantly advance the state of the art in controllable NLG.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Testing their approach on additional domains beyond restaurants and video games, and with other personality styles beyond the Big Five types explored here. The authors mention wanting to see if their methods generalize across more domains and personality types.- Experimenting with meaning representations that correspond to real entities (like actual restaurants or video games), rather than the synthetic meaning representations used from existing datasets. The authors hypothesize this could improve semantic accuracy.- Applying instruction tuning on a smaller model to try to achieve real-time generation while maintaining control over semantics and style. The current Jurassic model is too large for real-time use.- Further exploring different prompt formats, examples, and sampling strategies to continue improving semantic and stylistic control. The authors see promise in their current best methods but believe further optimizations could help.- Testing whether fine-tuned models could be adapted to this task instead of relying solely on prompting, to improve semantic accuracy. Prompting alone currently gives lower accuracy than fine-tuning.- Expanding the automatic evaluation to include human judgments, to further validate the semantic and stylistic quality. The authors currently rely on automatic metrics.In summary, the key suggestions are to test on more domains/styles, use more realistic meaning representations, apply instruction tuning, continue prompt optimizations, supplement with fine-tuning, and add human evaluation. The authors see prompting as promising but still needing improvement and validation.
