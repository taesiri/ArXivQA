# [ConceptLab: Creative Generation using Diffusion Prior Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02669)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can text-to-image generative models be used to generate novel, creative visual concepts that belong to a broad category but differ from existing category members?The key hypothesis seems to be:By optimizing an embedding vector to match a broad category while differing from known category members, guided by natural language constraints and an adaptive question-answering model, it is possible to generate creative new visual concepts within a category using text-to-image diffusion models.In essence, the paper explores using diffusion models and constrained optimization with natural language guidance to generate creative, novel concepts within a given category like "pets" or "fruit". The central hypothesis is that this approach can produce new visual concepts that fit within the category but look distinctly different from known category members.
