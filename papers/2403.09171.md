# [ADEdgeDrop: Adversarial Edge Dropping for Robust Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown powerful ability to gather graph-structured information for representation learning. However, their performance is limited by poor generalization and fragile robustness caused by noisy and redundant graph data.

- Existing graph augmentation methods like random edge dropping can help improve robustness but may bypass critical edges, weakening message passing. Thus, there is a need for more effective edge dropping methods.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel adversarial edge dropping method called ADEdgeDrop that can be incorporated into diverse GNN architectures. 

- It uses an adversarial edge predictor to guide the edge dropping process. The predictor determines edge dropping probabilities based on a line graph representation of the original graph, which captures relationships between edges. This improves interpretability.

- The edge predictor and GNN model are trained alternately using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and projected gradient descent (PGD) to optimize network parameters and input perturbations adversarially.

Main Contributions:

- Design of a supervised adversarial edge dropping strategy tailored for GNNs using a line graph transformation and trainable edge perturbations.

- Flexible incorporation into GNN architectures with joint optimization of edge predictor and backbone GNN model parameters.

- Enhanced robustness and generalization over state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets and GNN architectures.

- Better semantic interpretability owing to explicit modeling of edge relationships through line graph representation for determining edge importance. 

In summary, the key innovation is a novel adversarial edge dropping approach that leverages edge relationships to selectively retain critical connections and perturb redundant ones to improve generalization and robustness of GNNs. Experiments validate superiority over existing graph augmentation techniques.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel adversarial edge-dropping method called ADEdgeDrop for graph neural networks. Specifically:

1) It designs an adversarial edge predictor on a line graph transformed from the original graph to guide the edge dropping process, making it more interpretable and reliable compared to random edge dropping. 

2) The edge predictor and downstream GNN are jointly trained with an adversarial optimization framework consisting of SGD and PGD updates, allowing robust optimization of all parameters.

3) Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show ADEdgeDrop improves generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art graph augmentation methods when used with various GNN architectures. It also retains performance better compared to baselines when graphs are attacked by edge additions/deletions.

In summary, the key novelty is using an adversarial edge predictor on a line graph to supervise a more robust edge dropping process during GNN training. This improves model generalization and robustness to graph structure noise and attacks.
