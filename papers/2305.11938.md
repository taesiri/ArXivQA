# [XTREME-UP: A User-Centric Scarce-Data Benchmark for Under-Represented   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we create a multilingual benchmark focused on evaluating language models on user-centric tasks for under-represented languages in a scarce data scenario?The key elements of this research question are:- Multilingual benchmark: The paper introduces a new benchmark spanning many languages.- User-centric tasks: The benchmark focuses on practical, user-facing tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, etc. rather than more academic tasks. - Under-represented languages: The benchmark focuses on lower-resource languages where less training data is available.- Scarce data scenario: The benchmark assumes only a small amount of training data per language, reflecting real-world constraints.  The authors argue that existing benchmarks have limitations, like focusing too much on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer rather than fine-tuning, and focusing too much on common NLP tasks rather than user-centric ones. So the main hypothesis seems to be that by creating a benchmark focused on user-centric tasks for lower-resource languages in a realistic scarce data setting, they can better evaluate and drive progress on multilingual models for languages/scenarios that are currently under-served by existing benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new benchmark called XTREME-UP for evaluating natural language processing models on under-resourced languages in a scarce-data setting. Specifically, the key aspects of the XTREME-UP benchmark are:- It focuses on user-centric tasks like machine translation, question answering, etc. that are useful for speakers of under-resourced languages. - It emphasizes a realistic scarce-data scenario where only a small amount of annotated data is available for each language, based on what can be reasonably collected in a short time.- It covers 88 under-represented languages across 9 tasks, including newly created datasets for some tasks.- It provides standardized experimental setups for in-language fine-tuning and in-context learning.- It evaluates commonly used subword and byte-level models as baselines, showing the benefits of byte-level models for under-resourced languages.So in summary, the main contribution is the creation of this new benchmark to drive progress on scarce-data learning for under-represented languages, with a focus on tasks that are useful for speakers of those languages. The benchmark enables evaluating different modeling approaches in realistic low-resource settings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes XTREME-UP, a new benchmark for evaluating multilingual models on user-centric tasks with limited training data, focusing on under-represented languages and including newly created datasets for tasks like OCR, autocomplete, semantic parsing, and transliteration.
