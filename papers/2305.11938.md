# [XTREME-UP: A User-Centric Scarce-Data Benchmark for Under-Represented   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we create a multilingual benchmark focused on evaluating language models on user-centric tasks for under-represented languages in a scarce data scenario?

The key elements of this research question are:

- Multilingual benchmark: The paper introduces a new benchmark spanning many languages.

- User-centric tasks: The benchmark focuses on practical, user-facing tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, etc. rather than more academic tasks. 

- Under-represented languages: The benchmark focuses on lower-resource languages where less training data is available.

- Scarce data scenario: The benchmark assumes only a small amount of training data per language, reflecting real-world constraints.  

The authors argue that existing benchmarks have limitations, like focusing too much on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer rather than fine-tuning, and focusing too much on common NLP tasks rather than user-centric ones. 

So the main hypothesis seems to be that by creating a benchmark focused on user-centric tasks for lower-resource languages in a realistic scarce data setting, they can better evaluate and drive progress on multilingual models for languages/scenarios that are currently under-served by existing benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new benchmark called XTREME-UP for evaluating natural language processing models on under-resourced languages in a scarce-data setting. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the XTREME-UP benchmark are:

- It focuses on user-centric tasks like machine translation, question answering, etc. that are useful for speakers of under-resourced languages. 

- It emphasizes a realistic scarce-data scenario where only a small amount of annotated data is available for each language, based on what can be reasonably collected in a short time.

- It covers 88 under-represented languages across 9 tasks, including newly created datasets for some tasks.

- It provides standardized experimental setups for in-language fine-tuning and in-context learning.

- It evaluates commonly used subword and byte-level models as baselines, showing the benefits of byte-level models for under-resourced languages.

So in summary, the main contribution is the creation of this new benchmark to drive progress on scarce-data learning for under-represented languages, with a focus on tasks that are useful for speakers of those languages. The benchmark enables evaluating different modeling approaches in realistic low-resource settings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes XTREME-UP, a new benchmark for evaluating multilingual models on user-centric tasks with limited training data, focusing on under-represented languages and including newly created datasets for tasks like OCR, autocomplete, semantic parsing, and transliteration.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in evaluating multilingual NLP models:

- Focus on under-represented languages: This paper focuses specifically on evaluating models on under-represented languages, whereas most prior multilingual benchmarks have focused more on high-resource languages. The emphasis on languages with scarce training resources is an important contribution.

- User-centric tasks: The benchmark includes tasks aimed at real-world use cases like machine translation and question answering. This contrasts with some prior work that focused more on intrinsic tasks like syntactic parsing. Evaluating on user-centric tasks aligns better with practical applications.

- Scarce data regime: The benchmark assumes only a small amount of labeled data per language, reflecting the real-world scarcity of annotations for under-resourced languages. This is a more realistic setup than assuming lots of data.

- New datasets: The paper introduces some new datasets like for OCR and autocomplete to fill gaps. This is useful since prior benchmarks relied more heavily on existing datasets that were not designed for multilingual evaluation.

- Byte-level models: The results demonstrate strengths of byte-level models like ByT5 for morphologically-rich under-represented languages over subword models like mT5. This highlights the importance of rethinking modeling choices for low-resource languages.

- In-context learning: The paper includes prompt-based in-context learning results, complementing the supervised fine-tuning results. This could be an interesting direction to explore further for low-resource settings.

Overall, the focus on scarce data and user-centric tasks for under-resourced languages sets this benchmark apart from prior multilingual evaluations. The results also highlight some unique challenges in these settings that warrant rethinking modeling approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing fully multi-modal models for ASR and OCR instead of using separate upstream systems and downstream text models. The paper notes they provide text baselines to allow experimentation with text-only models, but hope to see end-to-end multi-modal models in the future.

- Exploring different prompt designs and exemplar selection strategies for few-shot in-context learning. The authors note that the choices they made for prompting likely impact the poor in-context learning results, and suggest searching for better prompts. 

- Analyzing model performance in more depth across languages, tasks, and example types to gain insights. The authors provide some high-level analysis but suggest more fine-grained analysis could reveal insights.

- Developing methods to improve model robustness and generalization, especially for under-resourced languages. The generally low performance highlights limitations of current models that need to be addressed.

- Exploring semi-supervised and self-supervised approaches to make better use of available unlabeled data. The authors note labeled data is limited for many languages.

- Studying the impact of additional labeled data from high-resource languages vs under-resourced languages. The paper allows additional data from high-resource languages but its impact is unclear.

- Developing methods to properly handle code-switching, which is common in multilingual societies. This could improve performance on languages like those in the semantic parsing task.

- Expanding the benchmark to more tasks, languages and domains. The authors regard the current benchmark as an initial version.

In summary, the authors suggest many promising directions to develop models that are more robust, generalizable, and performant for under-resourced languages with limited annotated data.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is the lack of benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation protocols for multilingual natural language processing models, especially for underrepresented languages with scarce training data. 

Some of the main issues and questions it seems to tackle are:

- Most existing multilingual benchmarks focus on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, which may not reflect realistic usage. This paper proposes a standardized multilingual fine-tuning setup with limited training data per language.

- Existing benchmarks often focus on tasks with readily available data rather than the most useful applications for speakers of underrepresented languages. This benchmark focuses on user-centric tasks like QA, MT, NER that enable key applications. 

- There is a lack of standardized datasets and protocols to evaluate multimodal capabilities like handling speech and images alongside text. This benchmark incorporates speech, vision, and text data.

- Whether subword models can handle morphological complexity well, especially in the low-resource setting, compared to byte-level models.

- How well large pre-trained models like T5 and PaLM can generalize to new languages and tasks through in-context learning with just a few examples.

- Providing strong baseline results using standard models on the tasks and languages in the benchmark to motivate further research.

Overall, the key focus seems to be creating more realistic and useful benchmarks reflecting the scarce training data setting for low-resource languages, rather than zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.
