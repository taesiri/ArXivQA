# [XTREME-UP: A User-Centric Scarce-Data Benchmark for Under-Represented   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we create a multilingual benchmark focused on evaluating language models on user-centric tasks for under-represented languages in a scarce data scenario?The key elements of this research question are:- Multilingual benchmark: The paper introduces a new benchmark spanning many languages.- User-centric tasks: The benchmark focuses on practical, user-facing tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, etc. rather than more academic tasks. - Under-represented languages: The benchmark focuses on lower-resource languages where less training data is available.- Scarce data scenario: The benchmark assumes only a small amount of training data per language, reflecting real-world constraints.  The authors argue that existing benchmarks have limitations, like focusing too much on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer rather than fine-tuning, and focusing too much on common NLP tasks rather than user-centric ones. So the main hypothesis seems to be that by creating a benchmark focused on user-centric tasks for lower-resource languages in a realistic scarce data setting, they can better evaluate and drive progress on multilingual models for languages/scenarios that are currently under-served by existing benchmarks.
