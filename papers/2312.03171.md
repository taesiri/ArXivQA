# [Combining Counting Processes and Classification Improves a Stopping Rule   for Technology Assisted Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Technology Assisted Review (TAR) aims to reduce the effort of manually reviewing documents for relevance in applications like systematic reviews and legal eDiscovery. 
- Existing TAR stopping rules estimate when a target level of recall is reached to minimize reviewed documents. 
- Prior methods either sample relevance from ranked documents or use classifiers, but don't combine these. Sampling may miss later relevant documents. Classifiers alone don't model observed relevance rates.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a stopping rule combining counting processes and text classification. 
- Counting process models the rate of relevant documents in the ranking. A text classifier estimates relevance of unreviewed documents.
- Classifier is integrated to inform the rate function fitting and estimate total relevant documents. No extra annotation needed for training.
- Two variants tested: using classifier labels directly or thresholding classifier scores.

Contributions:
- Propose a novel method to combine counting processes and text classification for improved TAR stopping rules.
- Evaluated on 6 datasets - CLEF eHealth, TREC Total Recall, TREC Legal, RCV1 collections.
- Proposed method consistently reached target recall with lower cost (fraction of reviewed documents) than baseline counting process and other methods from literature.
- Using classifier information further reduces cost and improves early stopping estimation.
- Show importance of handling class imbalance during classifier training for TAR problems.
- Proposed method advances state-of-the-art in TAR stopping rules to minimize reviewing effort.
