# [CATS: Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by Constructing   Auxiliary Time Series as Exogenous Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01673)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), recent research shows that univariate models often outperform multivariate ones despite the latter's ability to capture inter-series relationships. 
- This counter-intuitive phenomenon suggests two issues - the benchmark datasets may have weak inter-series relationships or previous MTSF models fail to effectively capture these relationships, leading to overfitting or fitting wrong patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a method called Constructing Auxiliary Time Series (CATS) to address the deficiency of previous MTSF models in handling inter-series relationships.
- CATS works by generating Auxiliary Time Series (ATS) from the Original Time Series (OTS) input. These ATS serve as exogenous variables to represent inter-series dependencies. 
- Three key principles are proposed for ATS - continuity, sparsity and variability to ensure ATS can effectively extract useful multivariate information.
- Specific neural network modules are designed to enforce these principles in ATS generation.
- Various types of ATS constructors are proposed to build diverse ATS views, enhancing adaptability.
- By predicting ATS and merging the results with OTS prediction, CATS incorporates inter-series relationships into the final forecasting.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces CATS method to empower time series forecasting models with the ability to handle diverse strengths of inter-series relationships via a 2D temporal-contextual attention-like mechanism.
- Identifies and implements three key principles (continuity, sparsity, variability) to ensure efficacy of constructed auxiliary time series. 
- Proposes diverse types of ATS constructors and demonstrates CATS's versatility in adapting to different MTSF datasets and challenges.
- Experiments show CATS significantly enhances forecasting accuracy and outperforms existing MTSF models, while reducing model complexity.
