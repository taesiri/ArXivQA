# [Dynamic Neural Network is All You Need: Understanding the Robustness of   Dynamic Mechanisms in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08709)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research questions addressed in this paper are:1) How does introducing dynamic mechanisms into static deep neural networks (DNNs) impact their robustness against adversarial attacks? 2) What design choices for dynamic neural networks (DyNNs) can help improve robustness against attacks generated for static DNNs?3) What is the additional attack surface introduced by dynamic mechanisms, and what DyNN design choices can improve robustness against such attacks?The key hypothesis seems to be that incorporating dynamic mechanisms like early exits into DNNs generally does not reduce robustness against existing attacks on static DNNs. The paper investigates this through empirical studies on transferability of attacks between static and dynamic networks. It also proposes a new attack specifically targeting the dynamic mechanism and analyzes design choices that impact robustness against this attack.In summary, the central research questions focus on systematically understanding the robustness trade-offs of introducing dynamic mechanisms into DNNs, and providing insights into designing robust dynamic networks. The hypothesis is that dynamic networks can achieve efficiency gains without significantly sacrificing robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is investigating the robustness of dynamic mechanisms in neural networks through empirical studies. Specifically, the paper focuses on evaluating three key aspects:1. Robustness of the dynamic mechanism itself against adversarial attacks generated on static models. This includes studying attack transferability between static and dynamic models, and evaluating if adversarial examples impact the efficiency robustness of dynamic models.2. Analyzing design choices for dynamic neural networks that can improve robustness against attacks generated on static models. This provides insights into exit placement strategies to make early exits in dynamic models more robust. 3. Introducing a new attack specifically targeting the dynamic mechanism, and evaluating design choices that can improve robustness against this attack. The attack aims to modify early exit behavior without changing final prediction.Through extensive empirical studies on CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets, the paper provides novel findings into the robustness implications of using dynamic mechanisms in neural networks. It also gives guidance on designing more robust dynamic models, while revealing potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed. Overall, the work advances understanding of the robustness tradeoffs when transitioning from static to dynamic neural network architectures.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper focuses on understanding the robustness of dynamic mechanisms in neural networks, whereas much prior work has focused just on static deep neural networks. Studying dynamic networks is important as they are becoming more common for real-time applications.- The paper systematically evaluates the robustness of dynamic networks through several research questions around attack transferability, efficiency robustness, early exit design, and vulnerabilities of the dynamic mechanisms. This provides a more comprehensive analysis than papers that look at robustness of dynamic networks through just one lens.- In terms of technical approach, the paper relies on empirical studies across datasets, network architectures, and attacks. Related work has often focused on theoretical analysis or evaluations on just one dataset/architecture. The empirical findings here provide broader insights.- The paper proposes a new "Early Attack" tailored to target the dynamic mechanism specifically. Most prior adversarial attack research targets the overall network output, not the internal dynamic behavior. This sheds light on a new potential vulnerability space.- Compared to defense papers, this work does not propose any new defenses for dynamic networks. The focus is purely on analysis. However, the findings could inform future defense development.- Overall, the systematic empirical analysis across factors and the specialized Early Attack are the key differentiators from prior art. The paper provides new insights into the robustness of an important emerging model type - dynamic networks.In summary, this paper advances the understanding of robustness for dynamic neural networks through comprehensive empirical studies and a targeted new attack approach. It provides both broader and deeper analysis compared to related prior research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Further exploration of dynamic neural networks and their robustness properties. The paper studied the robustness of dynamic neural networks, but there is more work to be done in understanding the trade-offs introduced by adding dynamic capabilities. The authors suggest further research into robust training methods and architectures for dynamic networks.- Development of additional robustness metrics and tests specific to dynamic neural networks. The paper proposed a new "Early Attack" to evaluate robustness of the dynamic mechanism. More metrics like this could be created to fully characterize the robustness.- Exploring different dynamic mechanisms beyond early-exiting. The paper focused on early-exiting dynamic networks, but other types of dynamic computation could be studied as well. The impact on robustness for other dynamic approaches like convolutional or skip layer networks could be evaluated.- Analyzing the robustness-efficiency trade-off. The goal of dynamic networks is to improve efficiency, but the impact on robustness needs more exploration. Better understanding this trade-off and how to balance it could guide designers of dynamic networks.- Testing on larger and more complex datasets. The paper used CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet. Evaluating robustness for dynamic networks on larger scale datasets like ImageNet would provide more insight.- Investigating defenses and mitigation strategies. Understanding how to improve robustness of dynamic networks through training procedures or architectural changes is an important direction. Defenses against the Early Attack could also be explored.In summary, the authors lay out several interesting future work areas related to increasing adoption of dynamic networks, evaluating their robustness, and developing techniques to improve robustness. More research is needed in this emerging area as dynamic networks become more widely used.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes EASR, a novel efficiency attack technique on automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. ASR converts speech signals to text and is used in real-time applications like helping visually impaired persons. The authors find that ASR response time depends on the input speech length, which impacts efficiency robustness. They propose two approaches in EASR to increase output text length: repeating words and adding silence segments. EASR is evaluated on two ASR models and datasets. Results show EASR can significantly increase response time by 2-6x while preserving accuracy. The authors highlight the need to evaluate efficiency robustness of ASR systems against such attacks.
