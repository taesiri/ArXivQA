## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Editable Scene Simulation for Autonomous Driving via Collaborative LLM-Agents":

Problem: 
Existing methods for editable and photo-realistic simulation of autonomous driving scenes have limitations in terms of user interaction efficiency, multi-camera photo-realistic rendering, and integration of external 3D assets. Specifically, they require extensive user involvement in intermediate editing steps, struggle to maintain view consistency across multiple cameras, and fail to support external assets to expand customized simulation capabilities.

Proposed Solution - ChatSim:
This paper proposes ChatSim, the first system that enables editable photo-realistic 3D driving scene simulation via natural language commands while allowing integration of external digital assets. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage a collaborative framework of multiple large language model (LLM) agents to interpret commands and execute specialized editing tasks. This enhances flexibility in handling complex demands. 

2) Propose a multi-camera neural radiance field method (McNeRF) to achieve photo-realistic rendering quality by aligning poses across cameras and modeling scene radiance rather than just color.

3) Develop a novel multi-camera lighting estimation technique (McLight) that blends skydome and surrounding illumination sampled from McNeRF. This enables realistic rendering of inserted 3D assets.

Main Contributions:

- First autonomous driving simulation system enabling sophisticated scene editing completely via natural language commands

- LLMs used innovatively in a collaborative multi-agent workflow to interpret commands and execute specialized editing tasks  

- McNeRF: first NeRF technique handling multi-camera inputs by aligning poses and modeling scene radiance for visual consistency

- McLight: first lighting estimation method combining sky with surrounding illumination from NeRF for realistic asset rendering

The proposed ChatSim system is shown to successfully edit and simulate customized autonomous driving scenes based on various language commands, outperforming prior arts in realism and flexibility.
