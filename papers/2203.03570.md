# [Kubric: A scalable dataset generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03570)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a general framework for generating high-quality synthetic data and annotations to train machine learning models, circumventing many of the problems with curating real-world image datasets. The key hypothesis is that such a synthetic data generation framework can produce datasets that are effective for training models across a range of computer vision tasks, reducing the need for expensive and specialized one-off data generation pipelines.Specifically, the paper introduces Kubric, an open-source Python framework for generating photo-realistic synthetic scenes with rich ground truth annotations. It aims to demonstrate Kubric's versatility across different vision tasks and its ability to scale data generation across thousands of machines.The paper showcases Kubric through 11 case studies spanning tasks like optical flow, 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, etc. Each relies on different annotations like flow, depth, segmentation, etc. generated by Kubric. The goal is to substantiate the claim that Kubric reduces the engineering effort in generating task-specific datasets and facilitates reuse and collaboration.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a general framework like Kubric can produce high-quality synthetic data to train models for a variety of vision tasks, reducing the need for expensive specialized data curation pipelines. The case studies aim to demonstrate Kubric's effectiveness across diverse tasks.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper introduces Kubric, an open-source Python framework for generating large-scale photo-realistic synthetic datasets with rich ground truth annotations for training and evaluating computer vision models, demonstrating its capabilities through a diverse set of case studies spanning object discovery, optical flow estimation, 3D reconstruction, and other tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces Kubric, a framework for generating synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks. Here are some key ways this work compares to other research on synthetic data generation:- Scope: Kubric aims to be a general-purpose synthetic data generation framework, supporting a variety of computer vision tasks like optical flow, 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, etc. Many other synthetic dataset papers focus on a single task.- Realism: Kubric uses Blender's raytracing engine for high visual realism. Other works often use rasterization which is faster but less realistic. The realism helps narrow the "sim-to-real" gap.- Scale: Kubric is designed to scale up to very large datasets and workloads distributed across thousands of machines. Many other synthetic data pipelines are designed for smaller-scale generation on a single machine.- Annotations: Kubric automatically generates rich ground truth annotations like segmentation, depth, flow, etc. along with the images. Other works often provide more limited annotations depending on the task.- Assets: Kubric integrates and processes assets from multiple 3D model sources like ShapeNet, PolyHaven, etc. Other works often use assets from a single source or create their own models. - Framework: Kubric provides a unified python framework and API for data generation. Many other works have specialized one-off pipelines that can be hard to reuse or build upon.Overall, Kubric aims to provide a general, realistic, scalable and well-annotated synthetic data generation framework. The goal is to make it easy for researchers to generate reusable datasets with rich ground truth for a variety of vision tasks. Compared to other synthetic data research, it is broader in scope while achieving high visual realism and supporting large-scale generation.
