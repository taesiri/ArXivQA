# [VerAs: Verify then Assess STEM Lab Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05224)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Science writing plays an important role in science education, but manually applying detailed rubrics to assess student work like lab reports is time-consuming and scoring can be unreliable. 
- Long-form STEM writing has seen little work on automated assessment using rubrics. Lab reports pose challenges of semantic diversity across rubric dimensions and lack of labels on which sentences are relevant to each dimension.

Proposed Solution:
- VerAs is proposed with two key modules - a verifier to select relevant sentences, and a grader to score them using the rubric.
- Uses a dual encoder in each module to learn better similarities of sentences/passages to rubric dimensions. 
- Verifier decides if a non-zero score should be given on each dimension, and selects the most relevant sentences.
- Grader predicts a score from 0-5 on each dimension using the sentences from the verifier, the rubric dimension itself, and the full report.

Key Contributions:
- VerAs outperforms multiple strong baselines on applying detailed analytic rubrics to two sets of college physics lab reports.
- Ablations demonstrate the importance of both the verifier and grader modules.
- Detailed error analysis explores differences in performance across rubric dimensions.
- Verifier alone also performs well on a dataset of middle school physics essays, demonstrating generalizability.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end neural architecture for automated assessment of complex STEM writing using fine-grained rubrics, with state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. The dual module design and insights on sentence relevance are notable contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an automated architecture with a verifier module to determine relevant sentences and a grader module that scores the sentences based on rubric dimensions, demonstrating strong performance assessing analytic rubrics for both college physics lab reports and middle school science essays.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an end-to-end neural architecture called VerAs for automatically applying analytic rubrics to assess longer forms of student writing such as college-level lab reports. VerAs has two key modules - a verifier module to select relevant sentences from a lab report for each rubric dimension, and a grader module to score the selected sentences. The paper shows that VerAs outperforms multiple strong baselines on scoring lab reports according to a detailed multi-dimensional rubric. Ablation experiments demonstrate the importance of both the verifier and grader modules. The paper also shows that just the verifier module alone can perform well on a less complex essay dataset for middle school physics. Overall, the paper demonstrates that neural methods can be effective for automatic assessment using analytic rubrics, even for complex long-form writing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Automated Assessment
- Lab Reports
- Analytic Rubrics
- Verifier module
- Grader module 
- Open Domain Question Answering (OpenQA)
- Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) 
- Knowledge distillation
- Dual encoder
- Ordinal log loss
- Formative assessment
- Science writing

The paper presents an end-to-end neural architecture called VerAs that has separate verifier and assessment modules to automatically score college level lab reports using fine-grained analytic rubrics. It is inspired by OpenQA systems and uses techniques like dual encoders and knowledge distillation. The goal is to provide formative assessment to help improve students' science writing skills. So the key terms revolve around automated assessment, lab report scoring, analytic rubrics, OpenQA, and dual encoder models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-module architecture called VerAs that has a verifier and a grader. What is the motivation behind having two separate modules instead of a single end-to-end model? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

2. The verifier module selects the most relevant sentences from a lab report for each rubric dimension. However, the paper mentions that human raters had low agreement on exactly which sentences were most relevant. How does VerAs handle this ambiguity in training the verifier?

3. Ordinal log loss (OLL) is used as the training objective for the grader module. Why is OLL better suited than standard cross-entropy loss for this ordinal regression task? How does OLL specifically account for the ordered nature of the class labels?

4. The paper compares VerAs to a baseline called FiD-KD which is inspired by open-domain question answering. What are the key differences in how FiD-KD processes the lab reports compared to VerAs? Why does VerAs outperform FiD-KD?

5. One of the ablations is using a random verifier instead of the trained verifier module. Surprisingly, this performs competitively. Why might this be the case? When would you expect the trained verifier to have a bigger impact?

6. The verifier seems to perform better on the simpler first lab assignment than the more difficult second assignment. Is there an explanation hypothesized in the paper? How could the verifier be improved for harder assignments?  

7. The only module evaluated on the middle school essays is the verifier. Why was the grader not necessary for this dataset? What differences in the essay grading task enabled the simpler single-module approach?

8. Could the dual encoder architecture used in VerAs be replaced by a single cross-encoder? What would be the tradeoffs of using cross-encoders instead? Are there any challenges in applying cross-encoders to this task?

9. The rubrics have very detailed scoring criteria for each point on the scale (Fig 1). How is this domain knowledge currently incorporated into VerAs? Is there a way to take more direct advantage of the precise rubric semantics?

10. The paper analyzed performance differences across rubric dimensions. What were some of the biggest challenges observed in handling certain dimensions automatically? How could VerAs be improved to handle these difficult cases?
