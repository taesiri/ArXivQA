# [Exploring the Limits of ChatGPT in Software Security Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of ChatGPT, backed by GPT-3.5 and the more advanced GPT-4 models, across a wide range of software security tasks. The key software security tasks explored include vulnerability detection and repair, bug fixing, patching, software debloating, root cause analysis, decompilation, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. 

The paper first provides background on the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 that powers ChatGPT. It discusses recent advancements that make ChatGPT highly capable not just for natural language processing but also for understanding and generating code. The paper then raises the research questions around ChatGPT's potential for assisting with software security, which requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort currently.

To evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities, the authors conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and manually crafted test cases for each software security task. Both quantitative results and detailed case studies are provided. The metrics used include precision, recall, success rate, etc. depending on the task. Comparisons are also made between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 where applicable.

The key findings are:

- ChatGPT demonstrates impressive capabilities in most software security tasks like vulnerability detection (92% success by GPT-4), vulnerability repair (95% success by GPT-4), and bug fixing (84% success by GPT-4).

- Surprisingly, ChatGPT can even decompile assembly code back to source code with higher accuracy than IDA Pro in the authors' tests. This shows its ability goes beyond just source code.

- GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 in most security tasks, showing the rapid progress of LLMs.

- Limitations of ChatGPT are also analyzed. Mainly, its performance degrades greatly when handling long input content. For example, the success rate of vulnerability detection drops from 98% to 66% when tested on real-world programs compared to short synthetic code.

In conclusion, the paper provides strong evidence that ChatGPT has high potential to aid various software security tasks. Integrating such AI models with existing security tools and addressing their limitations are identified as promising research directions. The comprehensive evaluation and analysis serve as an invaluable baseline for future research in this domain.
