# [MLPST: MLP is All You Need for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How can a simple MLP architecture effectively model spatio-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction tasks, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to more complex deep learning models?The key points are:1. The paper proposes MLPST, a novel all-MLP framework for spatio-temporal traffic prediction. 2. MLPST aims to achieve efficiency, lightweight structure, and effectiveness for practical spatio-temporal data mining applications.3. The core hypothesis is that a proper MLP architecture can sufficiently capture spatial and temporal dependencies for traffic prediction without needing more complex components like CNNs, RNNs, attention, etc. 4. The paper evaluates this hypothesis by designing SpatialMixer and TemporalMixer modules using MLP blocks, and comparing MLPST against state-of-the-art baselines on traffic prediction tasks.5. The results demonstrate competitive or superior performance for MLPST while requiring significantly fewer parameters and lower complexity than existing methods.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that MLP alone is enough for spatio-temporal modeling in this domain, and the paper provides evidence to support this claim through the proposed MLPST framework and experimental analysis.
