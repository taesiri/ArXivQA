# [MLPST: MLP is All You Need for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How can a simple MLP architecture effectively model spatio-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction tasks, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to more complex deep learning models?The key points are:1. The paper proposes MLPST, a novel all-MLP framework for spatio-temporal traffic prediction. 2. MLPST aims to achieve efficiency, lightweight structure, and effectiveness for practical spatio-temporal data mining applications.3. The core hypothesis is that a proper MLP architecture can sufficiently capture spatial and temporal dependencies for traffic prediction without needing more complex components like CNNs, RNNs, attention, etc. 4. The paper evaluates this hypothesis by designing SpatialMixer and TemporalMixer modules using MLP blocks, and comparing MLPST against state-of-the-art baselines on traffic prediction tasks.5. The results demonstrate competitive or superior performance for MLPST while requiring significantly fewer parameters and lower complexity than existing methods.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that MLP alone is enough for spatio-temporal modeling in this domain, and the paper provides evidence to support this claim through the proposed MLPST framework and experimental analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper outline, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel all-MLP framework called MLPST for spatio-temporal prediction tasks like traffic flow forecasting. This framework uses a SpatialMixer module to model global spatial dependencies and a TemporalMixer module to capture temporal variations across different time spans.2. MLPST has linear computational complexity and much lower parameters compared to existing methods, making it efficient and lightweight for practical applications.3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MLPST on two real-world traffic flow datasets, showing superior performance over existing baselines in terms of prediction accuracy, training/inference time, and model size. 4. Comprehensive analysis is presented to verify the validity of different components of MLPST, including ablation studies, temporal dependency analysis, and hyperparameter tuning.5. The authors argue that complex mechanisms like CNNs, RNNs, attention, etc. are not necessary for spatio-temporal prediction. An all-MLP architecture like MLPST can effectively capture spatial and temporal characteristics.In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing a simple yet effective all-MLP network called MLPST for spatio-temporal forecasting tasks, with linear complexity and strong empirical performance. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of using MLPs for modeling spatial and temporal dependencies without complex components.
