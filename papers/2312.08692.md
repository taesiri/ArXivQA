# [SpectralNeRF: Physically Based Spectral Rendering with Neural Radiance   Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08692)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SpectralNeRF, a novel neural radiance field architecture for physically-based spectral rendering. The method modifies the traditional spectral rendering pipeline into two main steps - generating a series of spectrum maps spanning different wavelengths using a multi-layer perceptron network (SpectralMLP), and then combining these maps to produce RGB outputs using a Spectrum Attention UNet (SAUNet). Given a ray's origin and direction, SpectralMLP constructs a spectral radiance field to obtain novel viewpoint spectrum maps. SAUNet then combines these to output RGB images resembling white light illumination. Using neural radiance fields to model spectrum maps and integrate over wavelengths follows physics more closely than RGB-only methods. Additionally, the spectral decomposition simplifies complex scenes and improves on baseline NeRF methods. The method is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming recent NeRF techniques in novel view synthesis, especially for challenging geometries and textures. Key contributions include building spectral rendering with neural radiance fields, designing the SAUNet fusion network to approximate spectral integration, and collecting spectral datasets to train and evaluate the approach. Experiments validate SpectralNeRF's superiority in representing complicated scenes.
