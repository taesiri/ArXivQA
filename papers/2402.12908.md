# [RealCompo: Dynamic Equilibrium between Realism and Compositionality   Improves Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models like Stable Diffusion struggle to generate realistic images that accurately reflect complex compositional descriptions involving multiple objects and their relationships. While T2I models can generate highly realistic single objects, they often fail to capture intricate object compositions specified in the text prompt. On the other hand, layout-to-image (L2I) models leverage additional layout inputs to achieve better compositionality but at the cost of lower realism. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a training-free and model-agnostic framework called RealCompo that combines the strengths of both T2I and L2I models to enhance the realism and compositionality of generated images. 

Key ideas:
- Use a large language model to analyze the text prompt and generate an accurate object layout for the L2I model as additional input. This pre-binds objects to their attributes.
- Design a novel balancer module that dynamically combines the outputs of T2I and L2I models in each diffusion timestep by weighting their noise predictions.  
- The weights are determined by analyzing the models' cross-attention maps to identify which areas they focus on. T2I models focus on object regions while L2I models focus on context. 
- Update the weights across timesteps by maximizing attention on relevant areas to improve localization and generation quality.

By fusing T2I and L2I models in this balanced way, RealCompo allows both models to complement each other's weaknesses in a plug-and-play manner without extra training.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first training-free and model-agnostic framework to combine T2I and L2I diffusion models for enhanced image generation.
- Introduces a novel balancer module that dynamically fuses models by weighting attention maps.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on compositional text-to-image benchmarks.
- Demonstrates improved generalization across different model choices.

The key innovation is the automated and dynamic balancing between realism and compositionality by analyzing the models' diffusing attention in a training-free manner. This opens new research directions for controllable image generation.
