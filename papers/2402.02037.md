# [EffiBench: Benchmarking the Efficiency of Automatically Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02037)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Code generation models are being widely adopted to aid software development through automatic code completion, debugging, and translation. However, current research has focused mostly on evaluating the correctness of the generated code while overlooking a critical aspect - the efficiency of the code. Efficient code is important for building scalable, sustainable software that meets demands while minimizing resource utilization. Hence, there is a need for a benchmark to assess code generation models' capability of producing efficient code.

Solution:
This paper introduces EffiBench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating code efficiency of code generation models. EffiBench contains 1,000 coding problems carefully selected from LeetCode based on their algorithmic complexity and efficiency-critical nature. Each problem is paired with an optimal, human-written canonical solution for comparison. The benchmark also integrates a test case generator to produce varied inputs to thoroughly analyze efficiency. Six metrics are defined to quantify execution time and memory usage - the two key indicators of code efficiency.  

Using EffiBench, an empirical study is conducted comparing 13 open-source and 8 closed-source large language models. The results reveal that GPT-4-turbo generates the most efficient code overall. However, its efficiency still lags behind human-written solutions, requiring 1.69x more execution time and 3.18x more total memory on average. Analysis across different algorithmic subsets also shows varying efficiency, indicating potential gaps in training data optimization for certain task categories.

Main Contributions:
- EffiBench - The first benchmark to specifically target efficiency evaluation of code generation models, comprising execution time and memory usage metrics alongside 1,000 problems.

- An empirical study benchmarking 21 large language models, providing efficiency insights including overall performance and variability across different algorithms.  

- Demonstrating that while state-of-the-art models like GPT-4-turbo have made strides in efficiency, significant gaps persist compared to optimal human-written code, presenting opportunities for future improvements.

The paper delivers a specialized benchmark to promote efficiency considerations alongside correctness in advancing code generation models through rigorous evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces EffiBench, a new benchmark comprising 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems for evaluating the efficiency of code generated by language models, and uses it to empirically evaluate and compare the efficiency of 21 large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing EffiBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for evaluating the efficiency of code generated by code generation models. Key aspects of EffiBench include:

1) It contains 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems selected from LeetCode, spanning 11 algorithm categories. Each problem has an executable human-written canonical solution rated highly for efficiency.

2) Test case generators are provided to produce varied and extensive test cases to thoroughly analyze code efficiency. 

3) It integrates a comprehensive set of efficiency metrics - execution time, memory usage, and normalized versions compared to the canonical solutions.

4) An empirical study is conducted comparing 13 open-source and 8 closed-source large language models on generating efficient code using EffiBench. Results show current state-of-the-art models still underperform compared to human-written canonical solutions, highlighting room for improvement.

In summary, EffiBench pushes the boundary of code generation model benchmarks to focus on the overlooked but critical aspect of code efficiency, in terms of both execution time and memory usage. It enables detailed quantification and comparison of different models' capabilities in producing optimized and efficient code.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- EffiBench - The name of the benchmark dataset introduced in the paper for evaluating code efficiency of code generation models.

- Code generation models - Models like CodeGPT, CodeGen, Copilot etc. that can automatically generate code snippets and functions to aid software development.

- Code efficiency - How fast and resource-efficient (memory, CPU etc.) the generated code executes. A key criteria lacking evaluation in current benchmarks. 

- Execution time - One of the metrics used to quantify code efficiency by measuring the time taken to run the generated code.

- Memory usage - Metrics like max memory usage and total memory usage used to evaluate memory efficiency of generated code.

- Normalized metrics - Normalized versions of metrics that compare efficiency of generated code to canonical solutions.

- Algorithm subsets - The benchmark contains coding problems across 11 key algorithm categories to allow fine-grained assessment.

- LeetCode problems - The benchmark sourced coding problems from LeetCode, filtered for efficiency critical ones.

- Canonical solutions - Human-written, optimal solutions for each problem to serve as baseline for normalization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces several efficiency metrics like Execution Time (ET), Normalized Execution Time (NET), etc. What are the relative merits and demerits of using these metrics over conventional time complexity analysis for evaluating code efficiency?

2. The test case generator uses GPT-3.5-turbo to produce test cases. What biases could this potentially introduce in the test cases? How would this impact the final benchmark results?

3. The paper reports efficiency results on single server configuration. How would results vary across different hardware configurations? What hyperparameters need to be controlled?

4. The prompt design seems to follow a typical few-shot learning format. How sensitive are the efficiency results to changes in prompt formulation, structure and content?

5. The paper analyzes efficiency across 11 algorithmic subsets. Are there any interesting correlations between algorithm categories and relative model efficiencies? What factors might explain these?  

6. The results show that efficiency of LLM generated code lags behind human written solutions. Is this gap uniformly spread or are there specific algorithm categories where LLMs perform closer to human level?

7. The benchmark construction methodology relies heavily on Leetcode problems. How well would the findings generalize to real-world code bases from open source projects?

8. The paper studies efficiency only for Python language. Would relative model rankings change if experiments were replicated for other languages like C++, Java etc?

9. The paper reports aggregate efficiency metrics over all test cases. Are there any specific test case features that correlate strongly with efficiency fluctuations?

10. The efficiency metrics focus on runtime performance. Expanding the benchmark to include metrics like code stability, maintainability index, cyclomatic complexity could give a more well-rounded picture. How could these be measured?
