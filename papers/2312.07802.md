# [Estimation of embedding vectors in high dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of learning embedding vectors for pairs of discrete random variables (X1,X2). Embeddings map the values of these variables to vectors in a low-dimensional space such that similar variable values are mapped to similar embedding vectors. The goal is to analyze how accurately these embeddings can be learned from samples of (X1,X2). 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a simple probability model relating the correlation of events X1=i and X2=j to the similarity (inner product) of their embedding vectors ui and vj. The model also includes bias terms to capture differing frequencies of outcomes.

- The problem of learning embeddings from Poisson distributed samples is posed as a biased low-rank matrix estimation problem. 

- A variant of approximate message passing (AMP) called Biased Low-Rank AMP is proposed to learn the embeddings by minimizing a regularized loss function.

- The accuracy of learning is analyzed theoretically in a large system limit where the number of possible values for X1,X2 grow to infinity while the embedding dimension is fixed.

- The joint distributions of the true and estimated embedding vectors are characterized precisely by a State Evolution. From this, the mean-squared error and other metrics can be computed.

Main Contributions:
- A tractable probability model relating variable correlations to embedding correlations and biases.

- An AMP algorithm for embedding learning from Poisson measurements by minimizing a regularized loss. 

- Precise predictions of embedding learning accuracy via State Evolution in a large system limit. 

- Relating key parameters like samples per outcome, strength of embedding correlations etc. to learning performance.

- Validation of theoretical predictions on synthetic data and real text data.

The main novelty is in the problem formulation connecting variable correlations to embeddings, the proposed algorithm, and the rigorous performance characterization using State Evolution.
