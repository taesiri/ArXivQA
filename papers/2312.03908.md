## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Simulating rigid body dynamics with frictional contact is challenging due to non-smoothness of solutions and painlev√© paradoxes. Formulating as nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) leads to difficult to solve problems that may not have solutions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a framework to write convex approximations of complex contact models using incremental potentials. This leads to an unconstrained convex optimization problem that is robust and avoids issues with NCPs.

- Derive conditions for existence of a potential and additional conditions for convexity. This allows incorporating various contact models like Hunt & Crossley.

- Propose regularized models of Coulomb friction that can be combined with different normal force models. Introduce 3 specific convex contact formulations: SAP, Lagged and Similar.

Contributions:
- Framework to incorporate contact models into a convex optimization problem with conditions for convexity. Allows more accurate contact modeling.

- Incorporate regularized Coulomb friction with different normal force models like Hunt & Crossley. Enables selecting models suitable for applications. 

- Develop 3 new convex contact formulations. Compare properties like accuracy, artifacts introduced, consistency. Demonstrate usefulness for robotics applications.

- Implementation in open source Drake toolkit. Validation on test cases and engineering applications at interactive rates while resolving stiction accurately.

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework for convex approximation of complex frictional contact models. This enables robust simulation of robotic tasks efficiently while also improving accuracy of contact physics.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework that enables writing a family of convex approximations of complex contact models. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a framework to incorporate contact models with arbitrary functional forms into a convex optimization formulation, and establishes conditions for convexity. 

- It develops the necessary conditions for an incremental potential to exist for a contact model, and additional conditions for convexity.

- It introduces a framework for regularized friction that allows incorporating Coulomb friction for arbitrary normal force models.

- It uses this framework to develop a convex approximation of compliant contact with Hunt & Crossley dissipation.

- It shows this framework can also incorporate barrier functions to model rigid contact, although favors compliant models given the observed robustness.

- It develops two new formulations of contact with dry friction within this convex optimization framework in addition to extending their previous SAP formulation.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a general framework to write convex approximations of complex frictional contact models, establishing conditions for convexity, and demonstrating this through several contact formulations.
