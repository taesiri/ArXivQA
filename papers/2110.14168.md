# Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is:Can training verifiers to judge the correctness of model-generated solutions improve the performance of large language models on solving grade school math word problems?More specifically, the key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1) Verification (training a model to score candidate solutions) will boost performance compared to just finetuning a model, especially with larger datasets.2) Verifiers will scale better with increased data than finetuning alone. 3) Token-level verifiers (predicting correctness at each token) will outperform solution-level verifiers (predicting correctness for the full solution).4) Including a language modeling objective when training verifiers improves results over just training to predict correctness.5) Using dropout as a regularizer boosts both finetuning and verification performance. So in summary, the central research question is whether training verifiers can improve math reasoning compared to standard finetuning, especially as more training data becomes available. The hypotheses focus on the settings and variants of verification that work best.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing GSM8K, a new dataset of 8.5K high quality grade school math word problems for evaluating mathematical reasoning skills of language models.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset of grade school math word problems called GSM8K, and shows that training neural network models called verifiers to judge the correctness of solutions generated by language models significantly improves performance on solving these math problems compared to just finetuning the language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper on training verifiers for math word problems compares to other related work:- The focus on developing a high-quality dataset (GSM8K) sets it apart. Many previous math word problem datasets have issues with quality control or lack natural language solutions. GSM8K aims to provide diverse, high-quality problems to facilitate research.- Using verifiers to evaluate and select among candidate solutions is a relatively new approach in this field. Some concurrent work has explored similar ideas, but this paper provides strong empirical results on the benefits of verification for math reasoning tasks.- The analysis of model scaling trends offers useful insights. The authors show that verifiers scale much better with increased data compared to standard finetuning, and provide evidence that verifiers give a similar boost to finetuning with 30x larger models. - Exploring different verifier architectures like token-level vs solution-level prediction is novel. The token-level verifiers seem to work better and enable visualizing the verifier's step-by-step reasoning.- The focus on natural language solutions sets it apart from work that uses more formal mathematical expressions. This could enable more interpretable reasoning and help models develop better verbal analytical skills.- The emphasis on analyzing regularization techniques like dropout is fairly unique. The results demonstrate regularization significantly improves performance for both finetuning and verification.Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions in rigorously evaluating different training methodologies on a high-quality task distribution. The analysis offers insights that could inform future work on improving mathematical reasoning abilities of language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing methods that scale even better on mathematical reasoning tasks. The authors state that they "expect verification to scale well to problem distributions that require more complex mathematical reasoning" and that they "hope GSM8K supports the development of new methods that scale even better."- Exploring how verification performs on more complex math problems and datasets, beyond the grade school math level of GSM8K. The authors suggest verification may have more favorable scaling compared to finetuning baselines as problem complexity increases.- Further improving the sample efficiency and generalization of models on math word problems through better regularization techniques, auxiliary losses, etc. The authors show dropout helps significantly, but suggest there may be room for further improvements.- Developing better automated metrics and datasets to measure progress, as model performance on GSM8K is still far from solved. The authors designed GSM8K to be a challenging dataset to probe model capabilities.- Combining the generator and verifier models into one unified model, instead of training separate networks. The authors state this could be a promising direction.- Pretraining models on additional corpora of mathematical knowledge to improve reasoning abilities. The authors mention prior work on pretraining models with curated math data.- Exploring different neural architectures specialized for mathematical reasoning vs. relying solely on generic language model architectures. The authors note some prior work has designed custom encoders/decoders.In summary, the main directions are developing methods that scale better, testing verification on harder problems, improving generalization, creating better benchmarks, unifying generator and verifier models, pretraining on math data, and designing more specialized architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces GSM8K, a dataset of 8.5K high quality and linguistically diverse grade school math word problems, to support research in training AI systems capable of mathematical reasoning. The authors show that even very large transformer models still struggle on this dataset due to its diversity and multi-step reasoning requirements.

They provide evidence that verification scales much more effectively with increased data compared to finetuning. The use of verifiers gives improvements comparable to a 30x increase in model size. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of verification for improving mathematical reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces GSM8K, a new dataset of 8.5K grade school math word problems with natural language solutions. The authors designed this dataset to have high quality and linguistic diversity, while still being solvable using only basic math concepts. They find that even very large Transformer models struggle to achieve high accuracy on this dataset when simply finetuned, showing it is a good benchmark for probing math reasoning skills. To improve performance, the authors propose training separate verifier models to score the correctness of solutions generated by a base model. At test time, they generate many candidate solutions and select the one ranked highest by the verifier. They show verification provides a significant boost over finetuning alone, similar to a 30x increase in model size. The verifiers are able to learn useful heuristics for judging solutions even when much smaller than the base model. The authors provide evidence that verification scales better with increased data compared to simply finetuning larger models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes training separate verifier models to evaluate the correctness of solutions generated by language models for math word problems. First, a generator model is finetuned on the training set of math problems to produce candidate solutions. Then, a verifier model is trained on the generator's solutions labeled as correct or incorrect, learning to predict solution correctness. At test time, the generator produces multiple candidate solutions for each problem, and the verifier ranks them to select the best one. This verification approach outperforms simply finetuning a single model, especially with larger training sets. The key insight is that verification is an easier task than generation, so the verifier can learn more effectively from additional data to pick out correct reasoning. Separating the generator and verifier also prevents the generator from overfitting the training solutions.
