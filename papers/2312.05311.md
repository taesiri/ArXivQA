# [360° Volumetric Portrait Avatar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing monocular avatar reconstruction methods rely on 3DMM-based facial tracking, which fails to capture non-frontal views like the side and back of the head. This results in incomplete avatar reconstructions covering only the frontal hemisphere. The goal is to reconstruct a complete 360-degree photo-realistic portrait avatar of the full head and torso from monocular RGB video inputs.

Method:
The proposed method has two main stages - template-based tracking and volumetric modeling of appearance and deformations. 

First, a 360-degree static scan of the subject rotating on a chair is captured to create a textured template mesh. This mesh is rigged with a parameterized body model called SMPL-X. The rigged template is used to track the dynamic video sequence containing different expressions.

Second, a volumetric neural representation is trained conditioned on the tracked facial expressions and pose parameters. Two types of deformations are modeled - a coarse deformation field from the SMPL-X model, and a personalized deformation field blendshape basis learned from the dynamic sequence. This allows interpolating between different expression appearances. 

The method represents appearance using neural radiance fields and deforms input samples from deformed space to canonical appearance space using the two deformation fields. As output, 360-degree controllable avatars are reconstructed.

Contributions:

- Template-based tracking of head, torso and facial expressions from monocular RGB inputs including back-views

- Hybrid deformation model combining linear blend skinning, 3DMM deformations and personalized learned blendfields 

- Volumetric neural representation embedded around template mesh, deformed using personalized blendfields

- First monocular approach to reconstruct entire 360-degree portrait avatars

In summary, the paper proposes the first complete 360-degree avatar reconstruction approach from monocular video. This is achieved through robust tracking and modeling of personalized deformations and appearance using neural representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called 3VP Avatar to reconstruct a complete 360-degree photo-realistic portrait avatar of a human subject, including head, torso, and backside, using only a monocular video as input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A personalized template-based tracking of torso, head and facial expressions, using only RGB inputs including frames capturing the back-side of the human.

2) A hybrid deformation representation, combining linear blend skinning, 3DMM-based deformations as well as personalized blendfields learned from a dynamic sequence of the subject.

3) A volumetric representation based on neural radiance fields which is embedded around the template mesh and is deformed with the personalized blendfields.

In summary, the main contribution is a method to reconstruct 360 degree portrait avatars from monocular video inputs, enabled by a personalized template-based tracker and a neural radiance field volumetric representation with a deformation blendshape model.

The paper proposes a method called "360° Volumetric Portrait Avatar" to reconstruct complete 360 degree animatable avatars of human subjects using only monocular video inputs. It uses template-based tracking of the torso, head and facial expressions. The appearance is modeled using neural radiance fields and deformation blendfields that allow interpolating between different expressions. The goal is to generate photo-realistic avatars that can be viewed from all sides using accessible input data (single camera videos). Key concepts include volumetric avatar modeling, novel view synthesis, facial performance capture and animation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a template-based tracking approach that utilizes SMPL-X for modeling pose and expression. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a template-based approach compared to direct 3DMM fitting on a per-frame basis?

2. The coarse deformation field is constructed from local triangle deformations of the SMPL-X mesh. Why is this deformation field not sufficient and what is the motivation behind adding an additional personalized deformation field?

3. The personalized deformation field is represented as a blendshape model with displacement fields and optimized coefficients. What is the motivation behind using a linear blend skinning model compared to directly optimizing displacements per vertex? 

4. The mapping network is trained to predict displacement field coefficients from jaw pose and expression parameters. Why are the predicted coefficients not view-dependent given that the paper mentions the view dependency issue with expression tracking?

5. The method relies on a static NeRF model that is conditioned on the deformation fields. What are the trade-offs compared to deforming the geometry explicitly and rendering view-dependent texture maps?

6. Balanced sampling is utilized during training to prevent overfitting to the frontal views. What problems could arise if no balanced sampling was used?

7. The method models the mouth interior region with deformation fields to capture expression-dependent appearances. What are limitations of this approach and how can the mouth interior be modeled more accurately?

8. The ablation study shows that blending color is inferior to blending deformation fields. What is the likely explanation for this? Does this finding also apply to classical blendshape modeling?

9. The paper demonstrates results on real videos captured with a single commodity camera. What modifications would be required to scale the method to internet videos with varying image quality and occlusion? 

10. The paper argues the method is more accessible by only requiring a single RGB camera. Do you think artifacts could increase for certain subjects that are challenging to capture properly with a single camera?
