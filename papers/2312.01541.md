# [Revisiting Non-separable Binary Classification and its Applications in   Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The inability to linearly classify XOR with a perceptron is often cited as a limitation of linear models, necessitating non-linear transformations in neural networks. 
- The authors revisit this claim and show that linear classification of XOR is indeed possible using a method they call "equality separation".
- They also explore using equality separation for anomaly detection, where normal data lies on a hyperplane while anomalies are farther from it.

Proposed Solution - Equality Separation:
- Instead of separating data between two halfspaces with a hyperplane, equality separation distinguishes data points that lie on or off the hyperplane within a margin.
- Two classifiers proposed: strict equality separator (data exactly on hyperplane) and ε-error separator (allows points within ε distance off hyperplane).
- Smoothly approximated with a Gaussian "bump" activation function for use in neural networks.

Key Properties and Results:
- Doubles VC dimension compared to halfspace separator - more expressive, e.g. can linearly classify XOR
- Competitive performance on simulated linearly separable and inseparable data
- Connection to density level set estimation and one-class classification for anomaly detection 
- Evaluated on anomaly detection using synthetic data and 3 real-world datasets - competitive or superior performance to baselines

Main Contributions:  
1) Proposal of equality separation paradigm for binary classification 
2) Introduction of closing numbers metric to relate binary classification and anomaly detection
3) Strong empirical performance of equality separation for supervised anomaly detection on both seen and unseen anomalies
