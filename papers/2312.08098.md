# [Adversarial Socialbots Modeling Based on Structural Information   Principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08098)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called SIASM for modeling adversarial behaviors of socialbots to advance proactive detection. SIASM is based on structural information principles to address the challenges of insufficiency and inefficiency in existing methods. It transforms the heterogeneous social network into a unified user graph and minimizes its structural entropy to generate an optimal encoding tree representing the hierarchical community structure. A new method is presented to quantify the network influence of each user community using its assigned structural entropy, which filters out trivial users to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, a conditional structural entropy measure is defined between the socialbot and other users to guide follower selection for maximizing influence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world social networks demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, SIASM achieves substantial improvements in terms of network influence (up to 16.32%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to 16.29%) under a robust detector. The key innovations of SIASM include the network influence quantification method and conditional structural entropy measure for efficient and effective adversarial socialbot modeling.

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel framework called SIASM (Structural Information principles-based Adversarial Socialbots Modeling) for modeling adversarial behaviors of socialbots. Specifically:

- SIASM is proposed to address the challenges of insufficiency and inefficiency in existing adversarial socialbot modeling approaches. It is based on structural information principles to enable more accurate and effective modeling.

- A method is presented to quantify network influence of each user community using the assigned structural entropy, which helps filter out uninfluential users and reduce computational complexity. 

- A new conditional structural entropy measure is defined between the socialbot and each user to guide follower selection for maximizing network influence. 

- Experiments show SIASM achieves significant improvements in network influence (up to 16.32%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to 16.29%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines when evaluated against a 90% accuracy detector.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the SIASM framework for more effective adversarial socialbot modeling by utilizing structural information principles. Key aspects include quantifying influence for complexity reduction and using conditional entropy to guide follower selection.
