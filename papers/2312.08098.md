# [Adversarial Socialbots Modeling Based on Structural Information   Principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Socialbots are automated user accounts that spread misinformation by imitating human behaviors, leading to an arms race between socialbot evolution and detector development. Existing works rely on reactive detection methods after socialbots evade systems. Although recent works explore proactive detection by modeling adversarial behaviors using reinforcement learning (RL), they face challenges of insufficiency and inefficiency.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework called SIASM based on structural information principles to address the limitations above and enable more effective adversarial socialbot modeling. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the social network as a heterogeneous graph and use structural entropy, which measures uncertainty in network structure, to generate a hierarchical community structure. This tree structure guides activity selection and follower selection.  

2) Quantify each community's influence using its structural entropy to filter out users with low influence. This enhances efficiency.

3) Define a conditional structural entropy to measure uncertainty of influence between the socialbot and potential followers. This guides follower selection to maximize influence.


Main Contributions:

- A new structural information based modeling framework SIASM that handles insufficiency and inefficiency limitations in existing adversarial socialbot modeling.

- A network influence quantification method using assigned structural entropy of user communities, which filters out trivial users and reduces computational complexity.  

- A conditional structural entropy measure to guide follower selection for maximizing network influence of the socialbot.

- Evaluations on real-world social network datasets demonstrate SIASM's superior performance, improving network influence by 16.32% and sustainable stealthiness by 16.29% over state-of-the-art methods.

The summary covers the key problem motivation, proposed structural information based solution, and main technical and empirical contributions of modeling adversarial behaviors using the SIASM framework.
