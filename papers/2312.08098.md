## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called SIASM for modeling adversarial behaviors of socialbots to advance proactive detection. SIASM is based on structural information principles to address the challenges of insufficiency and inefficiency in existing methods. It transforms the heterogeneous social network into a unified user graph and minimizes its structural entropy to generate an optimal encoding tree representing the hierarchical community structure. A new method is presented to quantify the network influence of each user community using its assigned structural entropy, which filters out trivial users to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, a conditional structural entropy measure is defined between the socialbot and other users to guide follower selection for maximizing influence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world social networks demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, SIASM achieves substantial improvements in terms of network influence (up to 16.32%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to 16.29%) under a robust detector. The key innovations of SIASM include the network influence quantification method and conditional structural entropy measure for efficient and effective adversarial socialbot modeling.
