# [Pretraining is All You Need for Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12952)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we leverage large-scale pretraining to improve image-to-image translation, allowing a single pretrained model to accommodate diverse downstream synthesis tasks?The key hypothesis is that a diffusion model pretrained on large amounts of diverse image data can serve as a powerful generative prior for high-quality image synthesis. By finetuning the pretrained model on downstream tasks, it can adapt to different modalities of input (e.g. segmentation masks, sketches) while generating realistic and detailed images. In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a pretraining-based image-to-image translation framework (PITI) that:- Uses a pretrained diffusion model as a generative prior over natural images- Finetunes the model on downstream tasks via a task encoder and two-stage training strategy- Incorporates techniques like adversarial training and normalized guidance to enhance synthesisThe experiments across diverse datasets and tasks aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of pretraining for boosting image translation quality compared to training from scratch or other SOTA methods. The central hypothesis is that the pretrained knowledge enables generating complex scenes with fewer artifacts and higher fidelity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new paradigm for image-to-image translation by leveraging large-scale pretraining. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes to regard various image-to-image translation tasks as downstream tasks and leverage a pretrained generative model as the universal prior. This allows all the tasks to benefit from the generative knowledge learned from a huge amount of natural images.- Adopts the GLIDE diffusion model pretrained on text-image data as the generative prior. This provides a semantic latent space to facilitate conditional image generation.- Designs a simple framework that finetunes a task-specific encoder to map the input condition to the latent space of the pretrained decoder. A two-stage finetuning strategy is proposed to maximize the usage of pretrained knowledge. - Introduces adversarial training and normalized guidance sampling to enhance the texture details and image quality for diffusion models.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging datasets across different tasks like mask-to-image, sketch-to-image, etc. Demonstrates the potential for few-shot image translation.In summary, the key contribution is a new pretraining-based paradigm for image-to-image translation. By leveraging large-scale pretraining, the approach significantly boosts the translation quality without any task-specific customization.
