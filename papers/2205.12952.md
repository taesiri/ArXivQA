# [Pretraining is All You Need for Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12952)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we leverage large-scale pretraining to improve image-to-image translation, allowing a single pretrained model to accommodate diverse downstream synthesis tasks?The key hypothesis is that a diffusion model pretrained on large amounts of diverse image data can serve as a powerful generative prior for high-quality image synthesis. By finetuning the pretrained model on downstream tasks, it can adapt to different modalities of input (e.g. segmentation masks, sketches) while generating realistic and detailed images. In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a pretraining-based image-to-image translation framework (PITI) that:- Uses a pretrained diffusion model as a generative prior over natural images- Finetunes the model on downstream tasks via a task encoder and two-stage training strategy- Incorporates techniques like adversarial training and normalized guidance to enhance synthesisThe experiments across diverse datasets and tasks aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of pretraining for boosting image translation quality compared to training from scratch or other SOTA methods. The central hypothesis is that the pretrained knowledge enables generating complex scenes with fewer artifacts and higher fidelity.
