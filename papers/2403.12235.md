# [IKSPARK: An Inverse Kinematics Solver using Semidefinite Relaxation and   Rank Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the inverse kinematics (IK) problem for robots. IK involves determining the joint configurations that achieve a desired end-effector pose. Solving IK is challenging because:
- The kinematic map between joint space and task space is nonlinear
- The solution can be non-unique or sometimes infeasible
- There are additional constraints like joint limits and collision avoidance 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new IK solver called IKSPARK that formulates IK as a semidefinite program (SDP) with additional rank constraints. The key ideas are:

1) Parameterize the problem using rotation matrices instead of joint angles. This allows converting nonlinear constraints into linear matrix inequalities.

2) Relax the IK feasibility set into an SDP with PSD matrix variables. The relaxation contains all feasible IK solutions and can certify infeasibility. 

3) Add rank constraints on the PSD matrices to recover the original nonlinear rotations. Develop an iterative rank minimization algorithm to find low-rank solutions.

4) Guarantee that upon convergence, the rank minimization recovers an exact solution to the original IK problem.

Main Contributions:

- New convex relaxation of the IK problem using rotations and SDPs. The relaxation is provably tight.

- Ability to encode complex constraints like closed chains, joint limits, etc. as linear constraints.

- Rank minimization algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees.

- Simulation results showing the approach works on a Baxter robot and Stewart platform with prismatic joints.

In summary, the paper develops a principled convex relaxation for IK that retains important theoretical properties. The combination of SDP and rank minimization helps avoid issues with local minima in traditional nonlinear solvers.
