# [SDR-Former: A Siamese Dual-Resolution Transformer for Liver Lesion   Classification Using 3D Multi-Phase Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate classification of liver lesions in multi-phase CT/MR scans is challenging but clinically valuable. However, analyzing such complex 3D multi-phase images manually is demanding even for radiologists.
- Existing methods using image-level or feature-level fusion have limitations in feature representation, scalability, and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Siamese Dual-Resolution Transformer (SDR-Former) tailored for liver lesion classification using multi-phase 3D CT/MR images.

Key Components:
- Uses a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) architecture that processes each phase independently yet simultaneously through weight-sharing networks, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
- Incorporates a hybrid Dual-Resolution Transformer (DR-Former) as the weight-sharing network, fusing CNN and Transformer mechanisms to handle high- and low-resolution inputs effectively.
- Introduces a Bilateral Cross-Resolution Integration Module (BCIM) to enable interactions between the CNN and Transformer branches. 
- Proposes an Adaptive Phase Selection Module (APSM) to highlight the most informative features across phases.

Main Contributions:
- The SDR-Former framework achieves superior performance in classifying lesions from multi-phase CT (3 phases, 2 lesion types) and MR (8 phases, 7 lesion types) datasets.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the vital roles of the DR-Former, BCIM and APSM components. 
- Analyses show the model's exceptional scalability, efficiency, and applicability to cross-modality transfer learning.
- The study will publicly release an extensive multi-phase MR dataset with 7 lesion types across 8 phases to promote research in this domain.

In summary, the SDR-Former presents an effective solution for multi-phase lesion classification that overcomes limitations of prior approaches through its specialized dual-resolution design and strategic integration of vital components tailored for this task.
