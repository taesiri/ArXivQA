# [CDFSL-V: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03989)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is cross-domain few-shot learning for videos (CDFSL-V). The authors propose a new benchmark and method for tackling the challenging problem of recognizing novel video categories using only a few labeled examples, when the labeled examples come from a different domain than the base training data. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- How can we develop an effective approach for cross-domain few-shot video classification, given that standard few-shot video classification methods make implicit assumptions about similar modes of variation, temporal dynamics, etc. that may not hold across domains?- Can a method based on self-supervised feature learning and curriculum learning allow models to learn more generic yet still discriminative spatio-temporal features that transfer better across domains with only a few labeled target examples?- Will the proposed benchmark and novel method outperform existing cross-domain few-shot learning techniques designed for images as well as standard few-shot video classification methods?The authors aim to demonstrate the efficacy of their new CDFSL-V benchmark and proposed technique for addressing these questions/hypotheses. Their method combines self-supervised pre-training on both source and unlabeled target data with a curriculum learning strategy to balance learning generic and discriminative features for improved cross-domain transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new challenging problem called cross-domain few-shot learning for videos (CDFSL-V). This extends the existing cross-domain few-shot learning problem to the video domain. 2. Developing a novel approach to solve CDFSL-V using self-supervised learning and curriculum learning. The key ideas are:- Using a masked autoencoder (VideoMAE) for self-supervised pre-training on both source and target data to learn generic features.- Proposing a progressive curriculum to balance learning discriminative features from source data and generic features from target data. The curriculum transitions from source supervised learning to target self-supervised learning.- Combining supervised loss on source data and consistency loss on target data in a single stage, instead of separate stages.3. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets showing the proposed method outperforms existing CDFSL techniques designed for images, as well as video few-shot learning methods.4. Providing ablation studies and analysis to demonstrate the impact of different components like curriculum learning, sharpening temperature, source dataset size etc.Overall, this paper makes solid contributions in formulating a new challenging problem in video domain, and developing an effective approach using self-supervision and curriculum learning to tackle it. The experiments validate the proposed ideas empirically.
