## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles (TABVs) have gained attention recently due to their ability to maneuver both on ground and in air. However, their hybrid dynamics make trajectory planning and control challenging. Existing methods either oversimplify the dynamics, limiting performance, or have high computational complexity. There is a need for a unified planning and control framework that ensures feasibility, efficiency, and accuracy.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a model-based planning and control framework for TABVs. The key contributions are:

1) A unified dynamic model and differential flatness formulation that captures the TABV's nonlinear dynamics in both locomotion modes. This benefits planning and control.  

2) A real-time flatness-based trajectory optimization planner that plans minimum-control trajectories satisfying state limits, obstacle avoidance, and nonholonomic constraints. It ensures dynamic feasibility.

3) A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based tracking controller that achieves high accuracy without violating constraints, using the full capability of the TABV model. An inner-loop INDI controller adds robustness.

4) Extensive real-world experiments on a custom TABV platform demonstrating the framework's superiority over prior methods in planning quality and control accuracy. Navigation succeeds in complex unknown environments.

Main Contributions:
- Unified modeling and differential flatness for encoding bimodal TABV dynamics 
- Flatness-based planner ensuring feasibility, efficiency and obstacle avoidance
- NMPC controller with INDI inner loop for performing aggressive maneuvers accurately
- Benchmark comparisons and navigation experiments validating planning and control performance

In summary, the paper presents a complete model-based framework for reliable autonomous navigation of TABVs in complex environments, with innovations in modeling, planning and control. The real-world validation is a key highlight.
