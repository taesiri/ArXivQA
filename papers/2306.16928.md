# [One-2-3-45: Any Single Image to 3D Mesh in 45 Seconds without Per-Shape   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16928)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we effectively utilize powerful 2D diffusion models to reconstruct high-quality 3D meshes from a single image in a fast, consistent, and generalizable manner? The key hypotheses appear to be:- 2D diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have learned strong 3D priors and can be leveraged to generate multi-view predictions. - Traditional NeRF optimization struggles with inconsistent multi-view predictions from diffusion models.- A cost volume reconstruction approach can be trained to handle inconsistent predictions and reconstruct high-quality 360Â° meshes.- Estimating the elevation in the canonical space of the diffusion model is critical for computing camera poses.The overall approach aims to address the limitations of existing optimization-based methods that are slow, inconsistent, and rely on 3D hallucination. By combining multi-view synthesis and generalizable reconstruction, the goal is to achieve fast, consistent, high-quality reconstruction that adheres closely to the input image.In summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that by integrating a 2D diffusion model with a 3D cost volume reconstruction technique, they can achieve superior single image to 3D modeling. The experiments aim to validate the quality, consistency, efficiency, and generalizability of the proposed approach.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an efficient method to reconstruct high-quality 3D textured meshes from single 2D images in a feedforward manner, while leveraging powerful priors learned by 2D generative diffusion models?The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:1) Existing optimization-based approaches that utilize 2D diffusion models struggle with long runtimes, inconsistent predictions leading to poor 3D geometry, and lack of fine-grained adherence to the input image. 2) By combining a view-conditioned 2D diffusion model with a cost-volume based generalizable 3D reconstruction technique, it may be possible to overcome these limitations and reconstruct full 360-degree textured meshes from single images without costly per-shape optimization.3) Critical modifications like multi-stage view selection, elevation estimation, and hybrid training strategies could enable the proposed approach to handle inconsistent multi-view predictions and generate high-quality 3D meshes.4) The proposed method can utilize powerful priors from large-scale 2D datasets and generalize to novel objects beyond the categories seen during training.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively marry 2D diffusion models with 3D reconstruction to build an efficient feedforward approach for high-quality image-to-3D conversion. The central hypotheses are around the design choices and training strategies needed to make this combination robust and effective.
