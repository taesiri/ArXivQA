# [Class-Wise Buffer Management for Incremental Object Detection: An   Effective Buffer Training Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09139)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an effective buffer training strategy called eBTS for class incremental object detection. The goal is to continually expand model knowledge by incorporating new object classes while retaining prior knowledge, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The method has three main components - a guarantee minimum process to ensure class diversity and distribution in the buffer; a hierarchical sampling strategy to prioritize highly unique and low-loss samples for buffer replacement; and a circular experience replay training approach to optimize buffer sample usage. Experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing replay schemes for incremental detection. Key results show reduced forgetting and improved overall mean average precision, especially for retaining a large number of prior classes. The ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of the buffer configuration algorithm and optimal ratios for experience replay and circular experience replay. In conclusion, the strategic buffer management and training approach provides an improved framework for incremental learning in object detection scenarios with continuous new classes.
