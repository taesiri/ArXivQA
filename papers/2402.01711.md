# [LLM on FHIR -- Demystifying Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need to improve health literacy and make health records more accessible/understandable for patients. Issues like complex medical terminology, language barriers, and limited medical knowledge make it difficult for patients to comprehend their own health data.

- Recent advancements like FHIR APIs and patient access to EHRs have not yet transformed patient engagement/outcomes. There is potential for AI/ML to help address health literacy challenges.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes LLM on FHIR, a mobile app that allows patients to interact with their health records using large language models (LLMs). 

- The app is built on Stanford's open-source Spezi platform and uses GPT-4. It connects to a patient's EHR via Apple HealthKit to access FHIR-formatted health records.

- Patients can ask the LLM questions about their records. The LLM provides summarized interpretations of the records in an understandable, personalized way to enhance health literacy.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstration of using LLMs to explain/contextualize EHR data retrieved via FHIR APIs in a patient-facing app. First application of its kind to the authors' knowledge.

- Evaluation via pilot study with synthetic patient data and medical expert reviews. Found high accuracy/relevance in LLM responses, showcasing potential to improve medical literacy/accessibility.

- Open-sourced the app components to enable further research. Highlighted opportunities and risks of using AI/LLMs for health literacy, including key learnings around filtering data fed to models.

- Proposed future work like executing models on-device to mitigate privacy/cost concerns and the need for clinicians to initially review LLM responses before full automation.
