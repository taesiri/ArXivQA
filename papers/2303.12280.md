# [NLOS-NeuS: Non-line-of-sight Neural Implicit Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we extend neural radiance fields to accurately represent 3D surfaces in non-line-of-sight imaging?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes NLOS-NeuS, which extends the neural transient field (NeTF) to neural implicit surfaces with a signed distance function for reconstructing 3D surfaces in NLOS scenes. 

- It argues that simply extending NeTF to SDF representation can result in incorrect non-zero level sets due to the under-constrained setup in NLOS imaging.

- To address this, the paper introduces additional constraints and losses to enable learning the correct SDF and zero level set surface.

- Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces in NLOS scenes, outperforming NeTF and other baselines.

In summary, the central research question is how to adapt neural radiance/implicit surface representations to the NLOS setting for accurate 3D surface reconstruction, which NLOS-NeuS aims to address through constrained learning of the SDF.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing NLOS-NeuS, which is a method for reconstructing 3D surfaces in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenes using neural implicit surfaces. Specifically:

- The paper proposes representing scenes in NLOS setups using a neural implicit surface defined by a signed distance function (SDF) and view-dependent reflectance function. This extends prior work on neural radiance fields (NeRF) and neural transient fields (NeTF) to incorporate geometric surface representation for 3D reconstruction. 

- The method renders transients measured on a wall in an NLOS setup using volume rendering of the SDF and reflectance function, allowing end-to-end optimization of the implicit surface.

- The paper identifies challenges in learning the SDF in the NLOS setup due to its under-constrained nature, and introduces additional loss functions and constraints to enable recovering plausible surfaces. These include losses to enforce zero level set distances and control the density distribution.

- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NLOS-NeuS can reconstruct high quality 3D surfaces from measured transients, outperforming prior methods based on NeTF or voxel representations. The continuous representation also enables reconstructing fine details.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel neural implicit surface representation and volume rendering approach tailored for surface reconstruction in NLOS imaging setups. The method advances the state-of-the-art in modeling and reconstructing 3D geometry from time-resolved measurements.
