# [NLOS-NeuS: Non-line-of-sight Neural Implicit Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we extend neural radiance fields to accurately represent 3D surfaces in non-line-of-sight imaging?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes NLOS-NeuS, which extends the neural transient field (NeTF) to neural implicit surfaces with a signed distance function for reconstructing 3D surfaces in NLOS scenes. 

- It argues that simply extending NeTF to SDF representation can result in incorrect non-zero level sets due to the under-constrained setup in NLOS imaging.

- To address this, the paper introduces additional constraints and losses to enable learning the correct SDF and zero level set surface.

- Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces in NLOS scenes, outperforming NeTF and other baselines.

In summary, the central research question is how to adapt neural radiance/implicit surface representations to the NLOS setting for accurate 3D surface reconstruction, which NLOS-NeuS aims to address through constrained learning of the SDF.
