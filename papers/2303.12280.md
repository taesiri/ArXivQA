# [NLOS-NeuS: Non-line-of-sight Neural Implicit Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we extend neural radiance fields to accurately represent 3D surfaces in non-line-of-sight imaging?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes NLOS-NeuS, which extends the neural transient field (NeTF) to neural implicit surfaces with a signed distance function for reconstructing 3D surfaces in NLOS scenes. 

- It argues that simply extending NeTF to SDF representation can result in incorrect non-zero level sets due to the under-constrained setup in NLOS imaging.

- To address this, the paper introduces additional constraints and losses to enable learning the correct SDF and zero level set surface.

- Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces in NLOS scenes, outperforming NeTF and other baselines.

In summary, the central research question is how to adapt neural radiance/implicit surface representations to the NLOS setting for accurate 3D surface reconstruction, which NLOS-NeuS aims to address through constrained learning of the SDF.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing NLOS-NeuS, which is a method for reconstructing 3D surfaces in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenes using neural implicit surfaces. Specifically:

- The paper proposes representing scenes in NLOS setups using a neural implicit surface defined by a signed distance function (SDF) and view-dependent reflectance function. This extends prior work on neural radiance fields (NeRF) and neural transient fields (NeTF) to incorporate geometric surface representation for 3D reconstruction. 

- The method renders transients measured on a wall in an NLOS setup using volume rendering of the SDF and reflectance function, allowing end-to-end optimization of the implicit surface.

- The paper identifies challenges in learning the SDF in the NLOS setup due to its under-constrained nature, and introduces additional loss functions and constraints to enable recovering plausible surfaces. These include losses to enforce zero level set distances and control the density distribution.

- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NLOS-NeuS can reconstruct high quality 3D surfaces from measured transients, outperforming prior methods based on NeTF or voxel representations. The continuous representation also enables reconstructing fine details.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel neural implicit surface representation and volume rendering approach tailored for surface reconstruction in NLOS imaging setups. The method advances the state-of-the-art in modeling and reconstructing 3D geometry from time-resolved measurements.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of non-line-of-sight imaging and 3D reconstruction:

- This paper proposes using a neural implicit surface representation (NLOS-NeuS) for 3D surface reconstruction in NLOS scenes. This is a novel approach as most prior work uses voxel grids or point clouds. Using a continuous implicit representation allows for higher quality surface reconstruction. 

- The key contribution is adapting neural implicit surfaces, which have shown success in multi-view 3D reconstruction, to the NLOS setting. The authors identify challenges like non-zero level sets and propose constraints and losses to address them.

- Most prior NLOS work focuses on reconstructing voxel occupancy or albedo. Surface estimation has been done before using point clouds or meshes, but not with implicit neural representations. This paper demonstrates the benefits of using a neural SDF for NLOS.

- Compared to other neural 3D representations, this method is tailored for the unique challenges of NLOS imaging. It builds off recent work on neural radiance fields and neural transient fields, adapting them with constraints suitable for the single-view confocal capture setup.

- The experiments comprehensively evaluate the approach on synthetic and real data, showing improved surface quality over baselines. The method is limited by the same challenges facing implicit surfaces, like representing thin structures.

- Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution in bringing implicit neural 3D representations to NLOS imaging. It adapts state-of-the-art techniques to the unique confocal capture setup and demonstrates clear improvements over past work on surface reconstruction from transient images.

In summary, the key novelty is in adapting neural implicit surfaces to NLOS and proposing custom constraints and losses to enable quality 3D reconstruction from transient images. The experiments demonstrate the benefits over past work, while limitations remain related to general challenges of implicit representations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Using other geometric representations besides signed distance functions (SDFs). The authors note that SDFs can struggle to represent some scenes like non-closed surfaces or objects with thin structures. They suggest exploring other representations like unsigned distance fields that may be more flexible.

- Extending the method to non-confocal setups. Currently the method is designed for a confocal setup where the light source and detector are collocated. The authors suggest extending it to non-confocal setups where the source and detector are separated.

- Incorporating additional sensing modalities. The current method relies solely on time-resolved measurement of indirect light. The authors suggest exploring the integration of other sensors like RGB cameras.

- Exploring neural scene representations beyond implicit surfaces. The authors focus on implicit surface representation, but suggest looking at other neural scene representations that could complement or improve on this approach.

- Applications beyond non-line-of-sight surface reconstruction. While the current method focuses on reconstructing opaque surface geometry, the authors suggest exploring other applications like estimating material properties.

In summary, the main directions pointed out are exploring alternative representations, extending to non-confocal setups, incorporating other sensing modalities, integrating other neural scene representations, and applying the approach to new tasks beyond surface reconstruction. Overall the authors position this work as an initial exploration of neural implicit surfaces for NLOS and suggest many promising avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents NLOS-NeuS, a method for 3D surface reconstruction in non-line-of-sight scenes using neural implicit surfaces. The key ideas are:

- Extends neural transient fields (NeTF) to represent scenes as neural implicit surfaces with signed distance functions (SDFs). This enables continuous scene representation and extraction of surfaces at arbitrary resolutions. 

- Introduces two loss functions to avoid non-zero level sets during training: (1) zero signed-distance supervision at detected surface points, (2) entropy loss on volume rendering weights to tighten surface around zero level set.

- Leverages first-photon analysis for additional SDF regularization loss.

- Models background effects like interreflections to avoid SDF fitting to background.

The method is evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, showing improved reconstruction quality over voxel-based and NeTF baselines. The continuous representation enables reconstructing smooth surfaces while preserving fine details. Overall, the paper presents the first neural implicit surface method for NLOS reconstruction, demonstrating advantages over discrete representations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes NLOS-NeuS, a new method for reconstructing 3D surfaces from transient measurements in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging setups. NLOS imaging aims to infer hidden scenes that are occluded from the camera using indirect diffuse reflections. The authors build on prior work on the neural transient field (NeTF), which represents NLOS scenes using multilayer perceptrons to estimate view-dependent density and appearance at each scene location. 

NLOS-NeuS extends the NeTF by incorporating neural implicit surface representation using a signed distance function (SDF). This allows reconstructing 3D surfaces rather than just densities. The key contribution is introducing constraints and losses to enable properly learning the SDF from the limited transient measurements on one side of the hidden scene. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NLOS-NeuS can reconstruct high-quality 3D surfaces not achieved by prior discrete voxel-based methods. The neural representation also enables rendering novel views of the reconstructed surface. Limitations include representing complex geometries like thin structures. Overall, NLOS-NeuS advances NLOS 3D reconstruction through implicit surface modeling.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes NLOS-NeuS, a method for representing and reconstructing 3D surfaces in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenes using neural implicit surfaces. The key ideas are:

- Extend neural transient fields (NeTFs), which represent NLOS scenes using an MLP to estimate volume density and view-dependent color, to also estimate a signed distance function (SDF). This allows reconstructing surfaces rather than just voxel grids. 

- Add constraints and losses to avoid learning incorrect "non-zero" level sets in the SDF due to the underconstrained NLOS setup where objects are only observed from one side. Specifically:

1) Zero signed-distance loss forces points on detected surfaces to zero distance. 

2) Volume rendering weight loss encourages tight surfaces by reducing the density bandwidth hyperparameter.

3) Lower bound loss uses space carved from first photon returns as SDF supervision.

- Render transients with volume rendering using the SDF, similar to NeuS and VolSDF.

- Extract surfaces by tracing isosurfaces of the SDF after training.

Experiments show this approach, dubbed NLOS-NeuS, reconstructs better surfaces than voxel or point cloud based NLOS methods. The neural representation also enables rendering novel views.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is how to reconstruct 3D surfaces from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging using neural implicit surface representations. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a method called NLOS-NeuS, which extends the neural transient field (NeTF) approach to incorporate neural implicit surfaces with a signed distance function for reconstructing 3D surfaces in NLOS scenes. 

- Previous NLOS imaging methods using voxel grids or point clouds have limitations in accurately representing fine details. Neural implicit surfaces can represent surfaces continuously at arbitrary resolution.

- However, the paper argues that simply extending NeTF to an implicit surface leads to incorrect non-zero level sets due to the underconstrained NLOS setup where the target object is only observed from one side.

- To address this, NLOS-NeuS introduces additional constraints and losses to enable learning a correct signed distance function and avoid non-zero level sets. This includes a zero signed-distance loss and a constraint on rendering weights.

- Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate NLOS-NeuS can reconstruct higher quality 3D surfaces compared to previous NLOS methods, validating the benefits of the neural implicit surface approach for this problem.

In summary, the key problem is how to adapt neural implicit surfaces, which have shown promise for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images, to the challenging setting of reconstructing surfaces from non-line-of-sight imaging. The paper proposes constraints and losses tailored for this setup.
