# [RESPER: Computationally Modelling Resisting Strategies in Persuasive   Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10545)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we computationally model and automatically identify "resisting strategies" that people employ to counter persuasion attempts in conversations?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature to characterize different resisting strategies people use when responding to persuasion attempts. 

- The framework is instantiated on two dialogue datasets - one on persuasion (P4G) and one on negotiation (CB). The datasets are annotated with resisting strategies based on the proposed framework.

- A hierarchical neural sequence labeling model called ResPer is proposed to automatically identify resisting strategies in dialogues, using contextualized utterance representations along with conversational context.

- Experiments show ResPer can identify resisting strategies reasonably well, outperforming several standard text classification baselines.

- Analysis shows resisting strategies help predict persuasion outcomes, sometimes better than persuasion strategies themselves. This highlights the importance of modeling resistance for understanding persuasive conversations.

So in summary, the main research question is around computationally modeling and automatically identifying resisting strategies in persuasive conversations, in order to better understand the dynamics of persuasion. The paper proposes a framework, annotated datasets, a model, and analysis to explore this question.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes a computational framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature to identify strategies people use to resist persuasion attempts in conversations, and shows that modeling these "resisting strategies" can provide insights into persuasion outcomes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Framework for resisting strategies: This paper proposes a novel framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature for identifying and categorizing resisting strategies in persuasive conversations. Prior computational linguistics research has focused more on analyzing persuasion strategies, so this provides a complementary perspective by considering how people resist persuasion attempts. The framework is instantiated on two distinct persuasion datasets.

- Automated prediction of strategies: The paper develops a hierarchical neural sequence labeling model called ResPer to predict resisting strategies automatically in conversations. This extends prior work using classifiers to identify persuasion strategies in text. The results demonstrate ResPer can effectively leverage conversational context to identify resisting strategies.

- Analysis of strategy impact: Unlike most prior work, this paper investigates the relationship between resisting strategies and persuasion outcomes. The experiments reveal resisting strategies can be better predictors of persuasion success than persuasion strategies themselves. This provides novel insights into the importance of modeling resistance for understanding persuasion.

- Generalizability: The framework and ResPer model are evaluated on both persuasion and negotiation datasets, demonstrating generalizability across persuasion domains. Prior computational research has tended to focus on one domain. The paper also notes challenges in fully generalizing trained models across datasets due to differences in language.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions in formalizing resisting strategies computationally, predicting them automatically in context, and analyzing their impact on outcomes. The experiments yield interesting findings regarding resistance in persuasion. This helps advance the computational modeling of persuasive dialogue.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring better models to encode the strategy information: The authors mention that in the future they want to explore better models to encode the sequence of resisting strategies for predicting conversation outcomes. This could involve trying different encoding architectures like transformers.

- Applying the framework to improve dialogue systems: The authors suggest applying their framework for identifying resisting strategies to improve personalized persuasion and negotiation dialogue systems. The idea is that detecting resistance could help these systems adapt their strategies accordingly.

- Studying the influence of power dynamics: The paper mentions wanting to study how power dynamics between participants impacts the use and effectiveness of resisting strategies in conversations. Things like social status, gender, age could play a role here.

- Cross-domain evaluation: The authors tried applying models trained on one dataset (persuasion or negotiation) to the other dataset in a zero-shot cross-domain setup. Performance was poor, but they suggest further explorations here with more data.

- Incorporating other factors: The paper briefly mentions wanting to study other potential factors that could impact persuasion outcomes beyond just resisting strategies. For example, personality traits, prior beliefs, argument quality, etc.

In summary, the main future directions are around developing better models for this task, applying it to dialogue systems, and studying how different factors like power dynamics, personalities, and domains impact the use and effectiveness of resisting strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a computational framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature to identify resisting strategies that people employ to counter persuasion attempts in conversations. The authors instantiate their framework on two public datasets of persuasion and negotiation dialogues to create annotated corpora of resisting strategies. They design a hierarchical neural network model called ResPer that leverages conversational context and utterance representations from BERT to predict the resisting strategies. Experiments show ResPer achieves competitive performance on both datasets, significantly outperforming neural baselines. Analyses reveal resisting strategies can provide additional insight into conversation outcomes beyond persuasion strategies alone, highlighting the asymmetry of power roles in non-collaborative dialogues. Overall, the paper introduces a novel framework to computationally model resisting strategies in persuasive conversations and demonstrates its benefits.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature for identifying resisting strategies in persuasive conversations. The framework defines seven common resisting strategies including source derogation, counter-argumentation, personal choice, etc. The framework is instantiated on two dialogue datasets - one involving persuading someone to donate to charity (P4G) and another involving buyer-seller negotiations (CB). For each dataset, the persuadee/buyer utterances are annotated with the appropriate resisting strategies. 

A hierarchical neural sequence labeling model called ResPer is proposed to automatically predict resisting strategies in new conversations. ResPer encodes each utterance using BERT and BiGRU, incorporates conversation context using a uni-directional GRU, and predicts resistance strategies. Experiments show ResPer achieves strong performance on both datasets, significantly outperforming CNN, BiGRU, and other baselines. Further analysis reveals resisting strategies are highly predictive of persuasion outcomes, often more so than persuasion strategies themselves. This highlights the importance of modeling resistance for understanding persuasive dialogues. The work provides novel insights into computational modeling of resisting strategies.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the main method used in the paper in one paragraph:

The paper proposes ResPer, a hierarchical sequence labeling neural framework to computationally model resisting strategies in persuasive conversations. It first identifies seven major resisting strategies grounded in cognitive psychology literature, and instantiates them on persuasion and negotiation conversation datasets to create annotated corpora. The model architecture uses BERT to obtain contextualized word representations, passes them through a BiGRU layer and self-attention to obtain utterance embeddings. These utterance embeddings are then fed into a unidirectional GRU with masked self-attention to incorporate conversational context. The final contextualized utterance embeddings are used to predict resisting strategies, treating it as a sequence labeling task. The paper also experiments with using the predicted sequence of resisting strategies to determine conversation outcomes. The model architecture and resisting strategy framework are evaluated on the persuasion and negotiation datasets.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a computational framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature to model resisting strategies used to counter persuasion attempts in conversations. The authors identify seven common resisting strategies like source derogation, counter-argument, and self-assertion. They instantiate this framework on two datasets - one on persuasion dialogues (P4G) and another on negotiation dialogues (CB). They design a hierarchical neural sequence labeling model called ResPer to automatically predict the resisting strategies in utterances. ResPer outperforms several competitive baselines, achieving macro F1 scores of 0.56 on P4G and 0.66 on CB.
