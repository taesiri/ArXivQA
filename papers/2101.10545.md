# RESPER: Computationally Modelling Resisting Strategies in Persuasive   Conversations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we computationally model and automatically identify "resisting strategies" that people employ to counter persuasion attempts in conversations?The key points are:- The paper proposes a framework grounded in cognitive psychology literature to characterize different resisting strategies people use when responding to persuasion attempts. - The framework is instantiated on two dialogue datasets - one on persuasion (P4G) and one on negotiation (CB). The datasets are annotated with resisting strategies based on the proposed framework.- A hierarchical neural sequence labeling model called ResPer is proposed to automatically identify resisting strategies in dialogues, using contextualized utterance representations along with conversational context.- Experiments show ResPer can identify resisting strategies reasonably well, outperforming several standard text classification baselines.- Analysis shows resisting strategies help predict persuasion outcomes, sometimes better than persuasion strategies themselves. This highlights the importance of modeling resistance for understanding persuasive conversations.So in summary, the main research question is around computationally modeling and automatically identifying resisting strategies in persuasive conversations, in order to better understand the dynamics of persuasion. The paper proposes a framework, annotated datasets, a model, and analysis to explore this question.
