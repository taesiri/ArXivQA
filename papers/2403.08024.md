# [xMLP: Revolutionizing Private Inference with Exclusive Square Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Private inference (PI) using cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation can enable privacy-preserving deep learning, but handling non-linear activations like ReLU has high latency. 
- Using faster quadratic polynomial activations leads to reduced accuracy compared to ReLU networks.

Key Insight:
- ReLU promotes sparsity which is beneficial for CNNs. In contrast, quadratic activations lack this sparsity inducing property. 
- This "information compounding" effect causes accuracy drop when switching from ReLU to quadratic activations in CNNs.

Proposed Solution - xMLP Architecture:  
- Avoids CNN-like structure and uses ViT-style architecture with mostly linear operations and matrix multiplications instead of convolutions.
- Residual MLP layers with quadratic activations for nonlinearity. 
- Pre-layer normalization and post-layer normalization with channel-wise scaling factors.
- Achieves high efficiency for private inference while maintaining accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First network architecture using only quadratic activations that matches accuracy of ReLU networks like ResNet.
- Analysis and insight into why quadratic activations underperform in CNNs.
- xMLP sets new state-of-the-art results for private inference, improving latency by 7x or accuracy by 4.96% over prior works.
- Shows potential of using model architecture design to address efficiency challenges in private deep learning instead of just optimizing cryptographic protocols.

In summary, the paper proposes the xMLP architecture that relies exclusively on quadratic activations, yet achieves equivalent accuracy and significantly better private inference performance compared to ReLU-based networks like ResNet. The key insight is how sparsity inducing property of ReLU helps CNNs, while xMLP's design avoids this limitation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes xMLP, a novel DNN architecture that uses square activations exclusively to enable faster and more accurate private inference compared to prior architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new deep neural network architecture called xMLP that uses only square activation functions instead of ReLU activations. The key contributions are:

1) xMLP is the first architecture that eliminates the need for ReLU activations entirely, relying solely on quadratic activation functions. Yet it achieves performance on par with CNNs like ResNet on image classification tasks.

2) The paper provides an analysis explaining why in conventional CNNs, square activations underperform compared to ReLU. It attributes this to an "information compounding" effect that ReLU helps mitigate through inducing sparsity.  

3) Experiments on CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet validate that xMLP models consistently match or exceed the accuracy of ResNet models with fewer parameters and activation layers.

4) For private inference tasks, xMLP demonstrates superior performance over prior architectures, achieving either 7x lower latency for the same accuracy or 4.96% higher accuracy for the same latency compared to the state-of-the-art.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating xMLP, a novel architecture that relies exclusively on square activations yet performs on par with ReLU-based models, while accelerating private inference by up to 7x.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Private inference (PI) - Performing inference on encrypted/private data to protect privacy.

- Multi-party computation (MPC) - A cryptographic protocol that allows multiple parties to jointly compute on data without revealing private inputs.

- Homomorphic encryption (HE) - An encryption scheme that allows computation directly on encrypted data.

- Activation functions - Nonlinear functions like ReLU and quadratic/square functions used in neural networks. 

- xMLP - The proposed neural network architecture that uses only square activations.

- Information compounding - The effect in CNNs where deeper neurons accumulate more global information, hampering learning. 

- Sparsity induction - Ability of activations like ReLU to zero-out less useful neurons, aiding CNNs.

- Beaver's triples - A MPC technique to efficiently compute square functions privately. 

- Latency vs accuracy tradeoffs - Key consideration in designing private inference systems and architectures.

- Microbenchmarks - Measurements of latency for individual operations like private ReLU or square.

So in summary, the key focus is on designing neural network architectures like xMLP tailored for efficient and accurate private inference using cryptographic protocols.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the xMLP method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that ReLU's superiority over polynomial activations is due to its sparsity-inducing property rather than avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients. Could you elaborate more on why this distinction is important? What evidence supports this claim? 

2. The xMLP architecture relies solely on matrix multiplications rather than convolutions. What is the intuition behind this design choice? How do you think it circumvents the "information compounding" effect associated with CNNs?

3. You mention that self-attention was omitted from the xMLP design since it is not conducive for private inference. Could you explain what specifically makes self-attention ill-suited for PI tasks? Are there any modifications that could make it more amenable?

4. How does the normalization strategy used in xMLP compare to other approaches like batch norm or layer norm? Why is layer norm more costly for private inference? 

5. The results show xMLP achieving better accuracy than ResNets with fewer parameters and activation layers. Do you think this effectiveness stems solely from the architecture itself or is the choice of square activation also a contributing factor?

6. For tasks beyond image classification, do you anticipate any challenges in adopting the xMLP architecture? Would certain application domains be better suited than others?

7. The private inference results utilize the DELPHI protocol. How does DELPHI compare to other PI systems? What modifications were required to tailor it to the xMLP architecture?  

8. What additional cryptographic techniques could further optimize the performance of private inference for xMLP models, especially for the linear operations?

9. The paper demonstrates substantial improvements on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet over prior works. How do you expect the gains to translate to more complex domains like video, speech, and text? 

10. Beyond accuracy and latency, what other metrics would be valuable to analyze when evaluating private inference systems like xMLP? Are there any privacy or security risks that could be assessed more thoroughly?
