# [xMLP: Revolutionizing Private Inference with Exclusive Square Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Private inference (PI) using cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation can enable privacy-preserving deep learning, but handling non-linear activations like ReLU has high latency. 
- Using faster quadratic polynomial activations leads to reduced accuracy compared to ReLU networks.

Key Insight:
- ReLU promotes sparsity which is beneficial for CNNs. In contrast, quadratic activations lack this sparsity inducing property. 
- This "information compounding" effect causes accuracy drop when switching from ReLU to quadratic activations in CNNs.

Proposed Solution - xMLP Architecture:  
- Avoids CNN-like structure and uses ViT-style architecture with mostly linear operations and matrix multiplications instead of convolutions.
- Residual MLP layers with quadratic activations for nonlinearity. 
- Pre-layer normalization and post-layer normalization with channel-wise scaling factors.
- Achieves high efficiency for private inference while maintaining accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First network architecture using only quadratic activations that matches accuracy of ReLU networks like ResNet.
- Analysis and insight into why quadratic activations underperform in CNNs.
- xMLP sets new state-of-the-art results for private inference, improving latency by 7x or accuracy by 4.96% over prior works.
- Shows potential of using model architecture design to address efficiency challenges in private deep learning instead of just optimizing cryptographic protocols.

In summary, the paper proposes the xMLP architecture that relies exclusively on quadratic activations, yet achieves equivalent accuracy and significantly better private inference performance compared to ReLU-based networks like ResNet. The key insight is how sparsity inducing property of ReLU helps CNNs, while xMLP's design avoids this limitation.
