# [Positive concave deep equilibrium models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing deep equilibrium (DEQ) models often lack formal guarantees regarding the existence and uniqueness of the fixed point problem being solved. This makes them potentially unstable in practice. Specifically, the convergence of the numerical scheme used to compute the fixed point is not formally established.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new class of DEQ models called "positive concave deep equilibrium" (pcDEQ) models. These models enforce nonnegative weights and activation functions that are concave on the positive orthant. This allows the authors to easily ensure existence and uniqueness of the fixed point without relying on complex assumptions from monotone operator theory as done in prior DEQ literature.

The fixed points of pcDEQ models can be computed with the standard fixed point iteration algorithm, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees of geometric convergence. This simplifies training.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of pcDEQ models equipped with guarantees of existence/uniqueness of fixed point and guarantees that the standard fixed point iteration converges geometrically fast to the fixed point.

2) Empirically showing that in practice only a few iterations are needed for numerical convergence of pcDEQ models, and the number of iterations does not increase during training.

3) Demonstrating that the assumptions for existence/uniqueness of fixed point in pcDEQ models are more easily verifiable than assumptions based on monotone operator theory or Lipschitz constants commonly used in DEQ literature.

4) Experiments on image classification demonstrating competitiveness of pcDEQ models compared to NODE, ANODE and monDEQ in terms of accuracy and number of parameters.

In summary, the paper makes DEQ models more stable by using ideas from nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory to propose pcDEQ models with formal guarantees regarding the fixed point problem.
