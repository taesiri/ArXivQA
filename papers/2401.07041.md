# [An automated framework for brain vessel centerline extraction from CTA   images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate automated extraction of brain vessel centerlines from CT angiography (CTA) images is important for diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases like stroke. However, this remains challenging due to the complex structure of cerebrovasculature, varying imaging quality, and effects of vessel pathology. Prior methods rely on additional annotation of vessel lumen segmentation, which is labor-intensive. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an automated framework for brain vessel centerline extraction from CTA images. The key ideas are:

1) Generate vessel lumen segmentation from annotated centerlines using graph cuts and kernel regression. This provides additional supervision during training without extra annotation effort.

2) Propose a dual-branch topology-aware UNet (DTUNet) that effectively utilizes both annotated centerlines and generated lumen segmentation via a topology-aware loss function and dual-branch architecture. This ensures topology consistency between predicted centerlines and segmentation.

3) Post-process predicted segmentation to extract final centerlines using skeletonization.

The framework has four main components - pre-processing, lumen segmentation generation, DTUNet and post-processing. Notably, lumen generation is not needed during inference.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate that introducing generated lumen segmentation during training improves centerline extraction performance, without increasing inference-time computation.

- Design a tailored DTUNet and topology-aware loss to effectively incorporate centerline and segmentation supervision signals.

- Comprehensive experiments on a multi-center CTA dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Subgroup analyses indicate promising clinical potential for stroke assessment.

In summary, this automated framework advances the state-of-the-art in brain vessel centerline extraction from CTA images by effectively utilizing available annotations during training through custom-designed deep network architecture and loss functions. Evaluations and subgroup analyses reveal its superiority and translation potential.
