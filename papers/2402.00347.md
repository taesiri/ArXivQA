# [Diverse Explanations from Data-driven and Domain-driven Perspectives for   Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models are being increasingly used in scientific domains, but there is a lack of trust in their predictions due to a lack of explainability. 
- There can be inconsistencies between the explanations derived from the ML models (data-driven perspective) and the domain knowledge of experts (domain-driven perspective).
- This is problematic because scientists need to trust the model explanations to guide further experiments and decision-making.

Main Sources of Inconsistency:
- Data-driven perspective: Multiple accurate but conflicting ML models and explanation methods can exist for the same dataset. It's unclear which one to trust.  
- Domain-driven perspective: Integration of domain knowledge is difficult and subjective. Stakeholders have diverse needs and may disagree with model explanations if they conflict with domain expertise.

Proposed Taxonomy of Explanations:
- Two types: feature-driven (global explanations) and example-driven (local explanations).
- These align with general requirements for human understanding and specific stakeholder needs.

Case Studies:
- Example-driven: Showed how different accurate classifiers can provide conflicting local explanations for diagnosing a patient. This causes issues for the doctor and patient stakeholders.  
- Feature-driven: Showed how different models and methods provide different rankings of feature importance. Also showed conflicting priorities from different scientist stakeholders.

Proposed Solution: 
- Explore a set of equally performing models (Rashomon set) instead of a single model. 
- This provides a range of explanations, allowing stakeholders to identify one that is accurate and aligns with domain knowledge.
- Can address inconsistencies and establish trust.

Main Contributions:
- Identified and explored main sources of inconsistency between data-driven and domain-driven perspectives. 
- Proposed taxonomy connecting ML explanations to human/stakeholder requirements.
- Demonstrated issues via case studies. 
- Suggested Rashomon set based solution to reconcile inconsistencies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper identifies inconsistencies between data-driven and domain-driven explanations for machine learning models from different perspectives, and suggests exploring a set of equally performant models (Rashomon set) to find one that provides explanations consistent with domain knowledge and stakeholder needs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two key contributions:

1. It identifies and explores inconsistencies between data-driven and domain-driven explanations in well-trained machine learning models from different perspectives. Specifically, it discusses four key challenges that can lead to inconsistencies - accurate yet misleading models, conflicts from the domain-driven perspective, example-driven explanation inconsistency, and feature-driven explanation inconsistency. Case studies are provided to illustrate these inconsistencies.

2. It suggests using Rashomon sets (collections of models with similar performance) to help address these inconsistencies and provide stakeholders a range of explanations to choose from based on their specific needs and domain knowledge. This set-based approach allows stakeholders to potentially identify an accurate model aligned with expected explanations that reinforce physical laws and requirements.

In essence, the paper calls attention to the problem of inconsistencies between data-driven ML explanations and domain knowledge, using case studies and examples to explore this, and proposes Rashomon sets as a potential solution to help resolve these inconsistencies. The goal is to contribute to the integration of explainable AI in scientific domains.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
- Machine learning (ML) 
- Data-driven explanations 
- Domain-driven explanations
- Data-Domain Consistency (DDC)
- Inconsistencies between data-driven and domain-driven perspectives
- Feature-driven explanations 
- Example-driven explanations
- Multiple stakeholders with different explanation needs
- Rashomon sets 
- Trust in machine learning models
- Integrating domain knowledge into ML models
- Evaluating explanations

The paper discusses issues with getting consistent and trustworthy explanations from machine learning models, especially when comparing data-driven model explanations versus explanations based on domain knowledge. It proposes a taxonomy of explanations into feature-driven and example-driven categories. The paper also highlights the challenge of multiple stakeholders needing different types of explanations, and suggests exploring Rashomon sets of equally performing models to find ones that match domain knowledge and stakeholder needs. Overall the key focus is on establishing trust and consistency between data-driven and domain-driven perspectives in explainable AI.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues for exploring a set of equally good models known as a Rashomon set before extracting knowledge from explanations. What are some of the key benefits and challenges with using a Rashomon set approach compared to selecting a single "best" model?

2. How exactly would you define the performance bound to determine which models belong in the Rashomon set for a given prediction task? What metrics and thresholds should be used? 

3. Once the Rashomon set models are identified, what methods can be used to analyze the set of models and explanations as a whole to identify useful insights? How could visualizations help with this?

4. The paper discusses conflicts between stakeholders due to differing goals and domain knowledge. How can the process of analyzing a Rashomon set help address conflicts between stakeholders? What role does communication between stakeholders play?

5. What modifications would need to be made to the proposed workflow if the prediction task has a very large set of potential features? How could dimensionality reduction techniques be incorporated?

6. For complex real-world scientific data, what are some likely challenges in actually finding a Rashomon set with multiple high-performing but differently structured models? 

7. The paper argues explanations should be contrastive, selective, and interactive. How do those criteria apply when analyzing a set of models rather than a single model?

8. How could the choice of explanation methods (e.g. SHAP, Integrated Gradients) impact the analysis of feature importance across a Rashomon set? What explanation methods would you recommend?

9. What validation approaches should be used to ensure the Rashomon set analysis provides scientifically plausible and useful explanations that align with domain knowledge?

10. How could the proposed analysis approach scale to large datasets with many samples and complex model architectures like deep neural networks? Would approximations of explainability methods be required?
