# [Style Injection in Diffusion: A Training-free Approach for Adapting   Large-scale Diffusion Models for Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing diffusion model-based style transfer methods require additional optimization steps like fine-tuning or inversion to transfer styles, which is time-consuming. They also struggle to leverage the full generative capabilities of large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a training-free style transfer approach that adapts a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model by manipulating the self-attention features, without any optimization. The key ideas are:

1) Style Injection: Substitute the key/value features of self-attention in Stable Diffusion with those from the style image during sampling. This transfers textures while maintaining content structure.

2) Query Preservation: Blend the query features of content and stylized images to preserve content structure.

3) Attention Temperature Scaling: Scale the attention magnitudes to prevent blurriness.  

4) Initial Latent AdaIN: Match the channel statistics of the initial noise latent between content and style to transfer color tones.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a training-free style transfer approach for large-scale diffusion models by manipulating self-attention features.

- Introduces style injection and query preservation to transfer textures while maintaining content structure.

- Proposes attention temperature scaling and initial latent AdaIN to deal with blurriness and color tone transfer issues.  

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance compared to previous style transfer methods.

- Allows flexible control over the style-content trade-off.

The key advantage is the ability to leverage large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion for style transfer, without expensive optimization or training. The style injection via self-attention manipulation is shown to be very effective.
