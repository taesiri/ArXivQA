# Internet Explorer: Targeted Representation Learning on the Open Web

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that actively searching the internet and downloading relevant images can be an effective way to improve visual representations for a target dataset, compared to using large static datasets. Specifically, the authors propose an approach called "Internet Explorer" which searches the internet in a self-supervised, actively improving manner to find useful data for a given target dataset. The core ideas are:- Rather than hoping a static pre-trained model will transfer well, actively search the internet to find data specifically relevant for the downstream task. - Treat the internet as a dynamic, open-ended dataset that can be queried.- Use text queries to image search engines to retrieve relevant images.- Train representations in a self-supervised manner on the downloaded images.- Progressively improve which images are downloaded by estimating relevance of past images and prioritizing better queries.The central hypothesis is that this approach of actively searching the dynamic internet can more efficiently find useful data and improve representations compared to pre-training on large but static datasets. The authors test this hypothesis by evaluating Internet Explorer on several target datasets and comparing against strong baselines.In summary, the key hypothesis is that actively and adaptively searching the internet for task-specific data is more effective for representation learning than static pre-trained models, even very large ones trained on hundreds of millions of images. Internet Explorer is proposed as a way to realize this idea.
