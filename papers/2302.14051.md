# [Internet Explorer: Targeted Representation Learning on the Open Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that actively searching the internet and downloading relevant images can be an effective way to improve visual representations for a target dataset, compared to using large static datasets. Specifically, the authors propose an approach called "Internet Explorer" which searches the internet in a self-supervised, actively improving manner to find useful data for a given target dataset. The core ideas are:- Rather than hoping a static pre-trained model will transfer well, actively search the internet to find data specifically relevant for the downstream task. - Treat the internet as a dynamic, open-ended dataset that can be queried.- Use text queries to image search engines to retrieve relevant images.- Train representations in a self-supervised manner on the downloaded images.- Progressively improve which images are downloaded by estimating relevance of past images and prioritizing better queries.The central hypothesis is that this approach of actively searching the dynamic internet can more efficiently find useful data and improve representations compared to pre-training on large but static datasets. The authors test this hypothesis by evaluating Internet Explorer on several target datasets and comparing against strong baselines.In summary, the key hypothesis is that actively and adaptively searching the internet for task-specific data is more effective for representation learning than static pre-trained models, even very large ones trained on hundreds of millions of images. Internet Explorer is proposed as a way to realize this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach called Internet Explorer for efficiently improving representations for a target dataset by acquiring relevant images from the Internet. The key ideas are:- Treating the Internet as a dynamic, open-ended dataset that can be queried to obtain useful data for a specific downstream task, rather than relying solely on static datasets. - Using an active learning approach where Internet Explorer searches the web to find images that improve performance on a target dataset. It does this by generating text queries, downloading images, training representations with self-supervision, estimating which images were useful, and prioritizing what to search next.- Showing that this approach can match or exceed the performance of models like CLIP that were pre-trained on massive datasets, while using orders of magnitude less compute and data. For example, on several fine-grained classification datasets, Internet Explorer reaches or surpasses CLIP accuracy after 30-40 hours of active querying and training on a single GPU machine, using only 1-2 million Internet images.- Demonstrating that Internet Explorer can progressively find more and more useful training data over time as it learns to generate better queries and focus its search.In summary, the key contribution is presenting an agent that can efficiently leverage the Internet's massive and dynamic visual data by actively searching for and learning from the subsets most relevant for a given downstream task. This enables customized representation learning using far less compute than pre-training gigantic models on massive static datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a comparison of this paper to other related research:- This paper proposes a novel approach to leverage the open web as a dynamic dataset for targeted representation learning. Rather than pre-training on large static datasets, it interactively searches the web to find relevant data for a specific downstream task. This contrasts with most prior work that uses fixed datasets like ImageNet or web-scraped datasets.- The interactive search approach is most similar to prior work like NELL and NEIL that also interact with the web. However, those methods perform undirected search to learn general knowledge, whereas this paper does directed search focused on a target dataset.- The approach has similarities to active learning, which selectively queries labels for a fixed dataset. But this work requires no labels and expands its dataset via search.- Using the web as a source of data relates to prior works that train on large web datasets. But that work trains on all data, while this paper searches for the relevant subset.- The proposed method trains representations using self-supervised learning like other recent work. But the key difference is how it obtains its training data.- This approach reaches strong performance using far less compute than large models like CLIP pre-trained on hundreds of millions of images. It shows that directed search for a task can be more efficient than training an "omniscient" model.In summary, this paper introduces a novel paradigm of interactively searching the web to create customizable datasets for targeted representation learning. This contrasts with the common approach of pre-training static generic models, and it demonstrates competitive performance with significantly less data and compute. The interactive search approach differentiates it from prior work that uses the web as an undirected data source.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Internet Explorer for efficiently improving visual representations for a target dataset by actively searching the web for relevant images. The key idea is to treat the dynamic and rich content on the internet as an open-ended dataset that can be queried to find useful data for a specific downstream task, rather than relying solely on fixed datasets. Internet Explorer searches the web by generating text queries, downloads images from the results, performs self-supervised training on those images to improve the model, determines which images were useful via a relevance score, and updates its search distribution to focus on useful concepts in the future. Experiments across several datasets show that Internet Explorer is able to significantly improve over baseline pretrained models and match the performance of much larger models by actively exploring the internet for 30-40 hours on a single GPU machine. The method demonstrates that the internet can be leveraged as a source of task-specific data to efficiently train customized models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method called Internet Explorer that can efficiently search the Internet to find relevant images to improve representation learning for a target dataset. The key idea is to treat the Internet as a dynamic, open dataset that can be queried in a targeted way to obtain data useful for a specific downstream task, instead of relying solely on large static datasets. Internet Explorer takes in a target dataset and cycles between generating text queries to search the Internet, downloading images from the results, performing self-supervised training on the downloaded images, evaluating which images were useful through a proposed image relevance reward, and updating the text query distribution based on rewards to focus on useful concepts. It combines concepts from WordNet with descriptors from GPT-3 to generate diverse and improvising queries. Experiments across several datasets show Internet Explorer can match or exceed the performance of models pre-trained on massive datasets, while using orders of magnitude less compute and data by efficiently exploring the Internet. The method demonstrates how we can move beyond pre-training on static datasets by treating the Internet as a learnable environment.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the method used in the paper:The paper proposes Internet Explorer, an online self-supervised learning agent that actively searches the Internet to find useful data for a target task. Given a small target dataset, Internet Explorer iteratively generates text queries to search engines, downloads the image results, trains an SSL model on the downloaded data, determines which images were useful via a relevance reward, and updates its search distribution to prioritize useful queries. Specifically, it combines concepts from WordNet with GPT-generated descriptors to form diverse text queries. It downloads images from the queries, computes a relevance reward based on representation similarity to the target data, filters useless images, and trains a Momentum Contrast SSL model on the useful images. It uses Gaussian Process Regression to estimate relevance scores for all concepts based on past experience. These scores determine the sampling distribution over concepts, which balances exploitation of useful concepts with exploration. Over iterations, Internet Explorer focuses its search on concepts relevant for the target data.
