# Internet Explorer: Targeted Representation Learning on the Open Web

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that actively searching the internet and downloading relevant images can be an effective way to improve visual representations for a target dataset, compared to using large static datasets. Specifically, the authors propose an approach called "Internet Explorer" which searches the internet in a self-supervised, actively improving manner to find useful data for a given target dataset. The core ideas are:- Rather than hoping a static pre-trained model will transfer well, actively search the internet to find data specifically relevant for the downstream task. - Treat the internet as a dynamic, open-ended dataset that can be queried.- Use text queries to image search engines to retrieve relevant images.- Train representations in a self-supervised manner on the downloaded images.- Progressively improve which images are downloaded by estimating relevance of past images and prioritizing better queries.The central hypothesis is that this approach of actively searching the dynamic internet can more efficiently find useful data and improve representations compared to pre-training on large but static datasets. The authors test this hypothesis by evaluating Internet Explorer on several target datasets and comparing against strong baselines.In summary, the key hypothesis is that actively and adaptively searching the internet for task-specific data is more effective for representation learning than static pre-trained models, even very large ones trained on hundreds of millions of images. Internet Explorer is proposed as a way to realize this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach called Internet Explorer for efficiently improving representations for a target dataset by acquiring relevant images from the Internet. The key ideas are:- Treating the Internet as a dynamic, open-ended dataset that can be queried to obtain useful data for a specific downstream task, rather than relying solely on static datasets. - Using an active learning approach where Internet Explorer searches the web to find images that improve performance on a target dataset. It does this by generating text queries, downloading images, training representations with self-supervision, estimating which images were useful, and prioritizing what to search next.- Showing that this approach can match or exceed the performance of models like CLIP that were pre-trained on massive datasets, while using orders of magnitude less compute and data. For example, on several fine-grained classification datasets, Internet Explorer reaches or surpasses CLIP accuracy after 30-40 hours of active querying and training on a single GPU machine, using only 1-2 million Internet images.- Demonstrating that Internet Explorer can progressively find more and more useful training data over time as it learns to generate better queries and focus its search.In summary, the key contribution is presenting an agent that can efficiently leverage the Internet's massive and dynamic visual data by actively searching for and learning from the subsets most relevant for a given downstream task. This enables customized representation learning using far less compute than pre-training gigantic models on massive static datasets.
