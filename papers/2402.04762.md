# [Color Recognition in Challenging Lighting Environments: CNN Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate color detection is challenging but critical for computer vision applications due to the influence of varying lighting conditions on color perception.  
- Existing methods like HSV color space are limited in robustness across diverse lighting environments and for detecting multiple, similar colors.

Proposed Solution:
- A new color detection method using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed. 
- First, image segmentation is performed via edge detection to isolate the object. 
- Then the segmented object is fed into a CNN trained on detecting colors under different lighting conditions.

Methodology:
- Image dataset contains 250 variant color images under diverse lighting.
- CNN architecture has 3 convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling for dimension reduction, 3 fully connected layers for feature abstraction and final color categorization output.
- Model is trained on 200 images and tested on 50 images.

Results:
- Training and validation loss decreased linearly over epochs.
- Training, validation and testing accuracy increased overall despite a temporary drop.
- Proposed CNN outperformed SVM, LSTM and Random Forest models.
- Qualitative results show accurate color recognition within detected bounding boxes.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates CNN's superiority for color detection across lighting variations.
- Combines segmentation and specialized CNN to emulate human visual perception.
- Enhances state-of-the-art for color detection in computer vision applications.
- Can be extended to other recognition tasks with similar robustness requirements.

In summary, the key innovation is using a CNN trained on color variations to achieve robust color detection that works reliably across diverse real-world lighting conditions.
