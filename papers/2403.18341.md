# [IterAlign: Iterative Constitutional Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18341)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) lack alignment with human values and societal norms, leading to issues like biased or harmful outputs. 
- Existing alignment methods like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or Constitutional AI (CAI) have limitations in terms of heavy human effort required or biases in pre-defined constitutions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes IterAlign, an iterative framework for automatic constitution discovery and self-alignment of LLMs.
- It utilizes red teaming strategies and datasets to reveal weaknesses in a base LLM. 
- A stronger LLM is then used to automatically propose constitutions targeting the identified issues. 
- The base LLM is guided by these constitutions to self-reflect and generate improved responses via in-context learning.
- The new responses are used to fine-tune the base LLM parameters.
- The framework runs iteratively to continually discover new alignment issues and refine the LLM.

Key Contributions:
- An automatic, data-driven constitution discovery and LLM self-alignment framework requiring minimal human effort.
- Ability to customize alignment using relevant red teaming datasets without needing domain experts.  
- Comprehensive experiments showing IterAlign enhances truthfulness, helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty of multiple base LLMs by 13.5% for harmlessness.
- Joint constitution discovery along with LLM alignment, providing insights into the model's weaknesses.

In summary, the key novelty is the iterative paradigm enabling automated constitution proposal and self-alignment to continually improve LLMs without heavy supervision. Experiments validate the effectiveness across safety benchmarks and base LLMs.
