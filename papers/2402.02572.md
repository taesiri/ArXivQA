# [A Quantitative Discourse Analysis of Asian Workers in the US Historical   Newspapers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
This paper explores historical representations of Asian migrant workers, referred to by the derogatory term "coolies," in 19th and early 20th century American newspapers. Specifically, the authors investigate differences in the semantic meaning and discourse around "coolies" across different U.S. states, between Union and Confederate states, and through text reprinting. This helps illuminate the history of racism towards Asians as an understudied topic compared to racism towards African Americans.

Methods:
The authors collect 124,511 newspaper pages containing "coolie" from the Chronicling America archive. They extract text snippets around "coolie" occurrences and analyze them using word embeddings to explore semantic meaning, overrepresentation statistics between subcorpora to find distinct discourses, and text reuse detection to find reprinted stories.

Key Findings:
- The meaning of "coolie" differs most in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Oklahoma and Arkansas compared to other states, with more discussion around prohibition and regulation.
- Confederate states associate "coolie" more with slavery, plantation agriculture, shipping/trade, while Union states associate it more with railroad work and wages. This aligns with history of using Asian labor to replace enslaved African Americans.  
- Analysis of a widely reprinted 1876 political statement shows Asians described as racially inferior to European immigrants in bringing "liberty" to America.
- A widely circulated poem reflects orientalist stereotypes and exoticization of marginalized groups including Asians.

In conclusion, computational text analysis provides new quantitative insights into historical representation of Asians and connections to broader racial issues in America. Key limitations are inconsistencies in digital archive coverage over time and space.
