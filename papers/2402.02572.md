# [A Quantitative Discourse Analysis of Asian Workers in the US Historical   Newspapers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
This paper explores historical representations of Asian migrant workers, referred to by the derogatory term "coolies," in 19th and early 20th century American newspapers. Specifically, the authors investigate differences in the semantic meaning and discourse around "coolies" across different U.S. states, between Union and Confederate states, and through text reprinting. This helps illuminate the history of racism towards Asians as an understudied topic compared to racism towards African Americans.

Methods:
The authors collect 124,511 newspaper pages containing "coolie" from the Chronicling America archive. They extract text snippets around "coolie" occurrences and analyze them using word embeddings to explore semantic meaning, overrepresentation statistics between subcorpora to find distinct discourses, and text reuse detection to find reprinted stories.

Key Findings:
- The meaning of "coolie" differs most in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Oklahoma and Arkansas compared to other states, with more discussion around prohibition and regulation.
- Confederate states associate "coolie" more with slavery, plantation agriculture, shipping/trade, while Union states associate it more with railroad work and wages. This aligns with history of using Asian labor to replace enslaved African Americans.  
- Analysis of a widely reprinted 1876 political statement shows Asians described as racially inferior to European immigrants in bringing "liberty" to America.
- A widely circulated poem reflects orientalist stereotypes and exoticization of marginalized groups including Asians.

In conclusion, computational text analysis provides new quantitative insights into historical representation of Asians and connections to broader racial issues in America. Key limitations are inconsistencies in digital archive coverage over time and space.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a quantitative discourse analysis of how Asian workers referred to as "coolies" were represented in historical US newspapers, finding differences in the meaning of "coolie" across states, associations between coolie and slavery in Confederate state papers, and circulating discriminatory rhetoric about Asian workers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a quantitative discourse analysis on the representation of Asian workers, referred to by the derogatory term "coolie", in historical US newspapers. Specifically, the authors:

- Compare the semantic meaning of "coolie" across different states using word embeddings to find differences. They find some states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have a very different discourse around "coolie" compared to most other states. 

- Identify words over-represented in then-Confederate vs then-Union state newspapers related to "coolie", finding Confederate states associate it more with slavery-related terms. This supplements arguments that Asian workers replaced slave labor after abolition.

- Detect reused texts about "coolies" and find examples of discriminatory expressions toward Asian workers in political statements and poems, showing negative stereotyping.

Overall, the main contribution is using computational text analysis methods to quantitatively explore the understudied topic of representation of Asian workers in historical US newspapers and discrimination toward this group. This supplements prior work focused more on tensions between white and black groups.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- "Coolie" - The derogatory term used to refer to Asian migrant workers that is the main focus of the paper's analysis.

- Racism - The paper examines historical racism and discrimination against Asian migrant workers in the US.

- Word embedding - A natural language processing method used to analyze the semantic meaning of "coolie" across different states. 

- Log-odds ratio - A statistical measure used to identify words overrepresented in Confederate vs Union newspapers.

- Text reuse detection - A method used to identify reprinted news stories about "coolies" and analyze their content.

- Chronicling America - The database of historical US newspapers used as the source of texts analyzed in the study.

- Semantic meaning - The paper examines how the meaning and connotations of "coolie" differed across states.

- Discourse analysis - The overall quantitative analysis of texts to understand discourses and ideas around "coolies."

- Labor, wage, slavery - Concepts associated with the "coolie" discourse that are discussed in the analysis.

In summary, the key focus is using digital humanities and NLP methods to analyze the historical usage of "coolie" as a case study of racism against Asian migrant workers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses word embeddings to compare the meaning of "coolie" across different states. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using word embeddings for this type of semantic analysis versus other NLP methods?

2. When calculating the log-odds ratio to identify over-represented words, the paper uses an informative Dirichlet prior. What is the benefit of using a Dirichlet prior in this analysis and how does it differ from a standard log-odds ratio calculation? 

3. The paper argues that Massachusetts and Rhode Island showed the most dissimilar meaning of "coolie" due to unique discourses created by uncommon words in those states. Do you think this explanation fully accounts for the dissimilarity or could other factors like data imbalance also play a role?

4. Text reuse detection is used to identify reprinted stories about "coolies." What are the challenges of detecting reprinted texts from OCR'ed historical newspapers? How does the n-gram based method used in this paper overcome those challenges?

5. Could the text reuse detection method be improved by incorporating semantic similarity measures in addition to n-gram matches? What would be the benefits and limitations of such an approach?

6. The paper finds a prevalent discourse of discrimination against Asians compared to European immigrants through textual analysis. Do you think the methods used sufficiently support this conclusion or are there limitations in deriving historical discrimination narratives computationally?

7. How robust are the textual analysis methods used in the paper to OCR errors and data imbalance in the underlying Chronicling America archives? What cautions need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results?

8. The paper does not analyze changes in the meaning and discourse around "coolies" over time. How could the analysis be extended diachronically to trace semantic shifts related to this term? 

9. How could spatial analysis methods be combined with the textual analysis approaches used here to better understand geographic variation in the "coolie" discourse?

10. The paper focuses only on the term "coolie." How could the analysis be expanded to related terminology around Asian migrant workers to develop a more comprehensive understanding of historical representations?
