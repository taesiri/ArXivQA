# [Self-Supervised Multiple Instance Learning for Acute Myeloid Leukemia   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) genetic subtypes is important for selecting appropriate treatments and improving patient outcomes. However, it requires expensive genetic testing on a single-cell level, which is costly and challenging.

- An alternative is analyzing blood smears through microscopy but identifying rare malignant cells is difficult for clinicians. Hence there is a need for automated methods.

- Supervised deep learning approaches require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Weakly labeled patient-level data is more readily available but poses challenges for learning. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper investigates self-supervised learning (SSL) to pre-train encoders for multiple instance learning (MIL) based AML subtype classification from weakly labeled blood smear images.

- Three state-of-the-art SSL methods are explored - SimCLR (contrastive learning), SwAV (clustering-based) and DINO (self-distillation) which can learn from abundant unlabeled medical images.

- The SSL pretrained encoders are integrated into an attention-based MIL framework that identifies subtype-relevant cells in blood smears for classification.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates SSL pretraining achieves comparable AML subtype classification performance to supervised pretraining, without needing labeled data.

- Provides extensive analysis of SimCLR, SwAV and DINO for medical image classification using MIL, to guide selection of suitable SSL techniques.

- Showcases the promise of combining SSL and MIL to unlock the potential of weakly labeled medical data for precision diagnosis.

- Provides a data-efficient and cost-effective solution for automated disease diagnosis, helping to propel the field.

In summary, this breakthrough study offers valuable insights into leveraging SSL and MIL for making the most of limited labeled data in medical applications.
