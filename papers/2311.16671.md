# [SplitNeRF: Split Sum Approximation Neural Field for Joint Geometry,   Illumination, and Material Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16671)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a novel neural inverse rendering approach called SplitNeRF for jointly estimating the geometry, material properties, and lighting of real-world objects from images. The key idea is to incorporate the split sum approximation from image-based lighting into a neural radiance field pipeline to disentangle lighting and materials. Specifically, they model pre-integrated illumination with an MLP trained with a novel Monte Carlo regularization loss for accuracy across roughness levels. To account for self-occlusions missing from the split sum approximation, they also propose learning an occlusion factor supervised by sampled visibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and efficiency, with high-frequency relighting possible after only 1 hour of training on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The method extracts meshes, spatially-varying BRDF parameters, and HDR environment maps to enable photorealistic rendering of the captured objects. Overall, SplitNeRF enables practical inverse rendering to create digital twins of real-world objects that can be realistically relit and rendered.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) A novel representation for modeling pre-integrated illumination as a single MLP, along with a corresponding regularization based on Monte Carlo sampling to ensure accurate learning. 

(ii) A method for approximating the effect of self-occlusions on pre-integrated lighting using Monte Carlo sampling, and using this to supervise an occlusion MLP to account for occlusions in the split sum approximation.

(iii) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in jointly estimating high-quality geometry, material properties, and lighting from images, achieving state-of-the-art relighting quality with under 1 hour of training on a single GPU.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and accurate neural inverse rendering approach based on surface rendering and the split sum approximation, with novel components like the integrated illumination MLP and occlusion supervision to disentangle lighting, materials, and geometry.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- SplitNeRF: The name of the proposed method. It refers to incorporating the split sum approximation into neural radiance fields (NeRF) for joint geometry, illumination, and material estimation. 

- Neural radiance fields (NeRF): A class of neural scene representations that model scene radiance and density as continuous functions using neural networks.

- Split sum approximation: An approximation used in image-based lighting that splits the reflectance integral into two terms - one for pre-integrating illumination and one for integrating material properties.

- Inverse rendering: The task of estimating scene properties like shape, materials, and lighting from images.

- Pre-integrated illumination: The illumination term in the split sum approximation that can be pre-computed independently of material properties. It captures lighting environment maps blurred for different surface roughness levels.

- Material properties: Properties like albedo, metalness and roughness that describe how light interacts with a surface. The paper aims to estimate these.

- Monte Carlo regularization: A novel regularization proposed that ensures the pre-integrated illumination MLP accurately represents lighting across roughness levels.

- Occlusion factor: A derived term to account for self-occlusions within the split sum approximation. It is supervised via Monte Carlo sampling.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel regularizer for learning pre-integrated illumination based on Monte Carlo sampling. Can you explain in detail the derivation and justification behind this proposed loss term? What assumptions were made?

2. The occlusion factor is derived to account for self-occlusions within the split sum approximation. Explain how this occlusion factor is obtained and how the diffuse and specular occlusion terms are supervised using Monte Carlo sampling. 

3. The paper models pre-integrated illumination as the output of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). What are the advantages and potential limitations of using an MLP over other representations for modeling illumination?

4. Table 3 shows an ablation comparing using an MLP versus a mipmap for representing illumination. While the mipmap performs better, why does the paper ultimately use the MLP representation despite being slightly worse?

5. The ambient occlusion prediction helps disentangle shadows from albedo as shown qualitatively in Figure 4. Quantitatively, how much does the occlusion loss term improve performance as shown in Table 2?

6. Figure 5 visualizes predicted illumination with and without the proposed regularizer. In what ways do the predictions qualitatively differ? What causes these differences?

7. The paper assumes the Cook-Torrance reflection model and makes additional approximations to the BRDF to enable the split sum approximation. What impact could these assumptions have on the accuracy of the method?

8. How does the rendering pipeline used for evaluation enable disentangling errors in geometry, material properties, and illumination predictions? What other evaluation approaches could be used?  

9. For real-world scenes, what practical considerations need to be addressed regarding dataset capture and pre-processing to enable the success of the proposed approach?

10. The method trains quickly, in under an hour on a single GPU. However, the used model capacity is still quite large. What opportunities exist to improve efficiency and reduce computation costs?
