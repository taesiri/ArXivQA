# [DiffRate : Differentiable Compression Rate for Efficient Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17997)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we optimize the token compression rate in vision transformers (ViTs) in a differentiable manner to achieve efficient and effective compression? 

More specifically, the key points are:

- Current token compression methods like pruning and merging rely on manually selecting the compression rate (number of tokens to remove) per layer, which is suboptimal. 

- The paper proposes a novel differentiable compression rate framework called DiffRate to automatically learn the optimal layer-wise compression rates with end-to-end gradient optimization.

- DiffRate allows jointly optimizing compression via pruning and merging in a unified framework with a differentiable compression rate.

- A novel differentiable discrete proxy (DDP) module is introduced to enable gradient-based learning of discrete compression rates.

- Experiments show DiffRate outperforms prior arts in compressing various ViTs without fine-tuning, and is efficient, flexible, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that making the compression rate in token pruning/merging differentiable can lead to more effective and efficient compression of ViTs compared to hand-designed or input-adaptive compression rates. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new token compression framework called Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate) that formulates token compression as an optimization problem and makes the compression rate differentiable. 

2. It introduces a novel Differentiable Discrete Proxy (DDP) module that enables optimizing the compression rate with gradient backpropagation. DDP consists of a token sorting procedure and a reparameterization trick.

3. It unifies token pruning and merging into a single framework by integrating them in a differentiable manner using the learned compression rates.

4. Experiments show that DiffRate achieves state-of-the-art performance on compressing various vision transformers without fine-tuning the models. For example, it reduces 40% FLOPs on ViT-H with only 0.16% accuracy drop.

5. DiffRate demonstrates several appealing properties:
- It automatically learns layer-wise compression rates.
- It is highly efficient, converging the compression rate within 2.7 GPU hours. 
- It works well even with only 1,000 images for compression rate optimization.

In summary, the core innovation is formulating token compression as an optimization problem with differentiable compression rates. This allows jointly optimizing pruning and merging in a unified framework to achieve better efficiency-accuracy trade-off. DiffRate provides an effective way to improve vision transformers for practical usage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a novel differentiable token compression method called DiffRate for vision transformers. DiffRate can automatically determine the optimal compression rate in each layer through end-to-end gradient optimization, enabling efficient pruning and merging of tokens simultaneously. The key idea is a differentiable discrete proxy module that allows gradient propagation through discrete compression rates.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for token compression in vision transformers, which aims to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy. Here are some key points on how it compares to prior work:

- Integrates both token pruning and merging: Most prior work focused on either pruning or merging in isolation. This paper proposes a unified framework that can seamlessly combine both techniques through differentiable compression rates.

- Learns compression rates automatically: Previous methods relied on hand-crafted compression rates per layer, which is suboptimal. This paper formulates it as an optimization problem and solves it through a differentiable proxy, enabling automatic search of optimal rates. 

- State-of-the-art results: Experiments demonstrate superior performance over prior arts like EViT and ToMe across various models, even without fine-tuning the network. For example, it achieves 40% FLOPs reduction on ViT-H with only 0.16% accuracy drop.

- Efficient compression rate optimization: The proposed method requires only ~3 epochs to determine the compression schedule, making it easy to apply.

- Applicable to hierarchical ViTs: The paper also introduces an uncompression module to extend the approach to hierarchical vision transformers like Swin and CAFormer.

- Compatible with hardware-aware optimization: It can optimize for hardware metrics like latency/power by incorporating differentiable proxies.

Overall, the key novelty is the formulation of compression rate optimization as a differentiable problem, which allows end-to-end learning of optimal schedules. The results demonstrate strong potential of this idea to advance token compression research and improve efficiency of vision transformers.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel token compression method called Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate). DiffRate formulates token compression as an optimization problem to search for the optimal pruning and merging compression rates in each transformer block. It introduces a Differentiable Discrete Proxy module that enables propagating the loss function's gradient onto the compression ratio, which was previously viewed as a non-differentiable hyperparameter. DiffRate seamlessly integrates token pruning and merging in a unified framework and automatically determines layer-wise compression rates through end-to-end gradient optimization. Experiments show that DiffRate outperforms previous token compression methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on off-the-shelf ViT models. For example, DiffRate reduces the FLOPs of ViT-H by 40% with only 0.16% accuracy drop without any fine-tuning. The key innovation is enabling differentiable compression rates, allowing DiffRate to find optimal schedules for pruning and merging tokens in different layers. This provides an efficient way to improve ViTs without modifying network architecture or weights.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate) for efficient vision transformers (ViTs). DiffRate unifies token pruning and token merging into a single framework and optimizes the compression rate in a differentiable manner. The key idea is to preserve the top K most important tokens for all images, enabling parallel batch computation. To achieve this, the authors introduce the Differentiable Discrete Proxy (DDP) module, which comprises a token sorting procedure and a reparameterization trick. In the sorting step, tokens are ranked by importance metrics like class attention. The reparameterization trick then enables selecting top K tokens through gradient optimization of discrete compression rate probabilities. 

Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffRate outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like EViT and ToMe. For example, DiffRate achieves 40% FLOPs reduction and 50% throughput improvement on ViT-H with only 0.16% accuracy drop, even outperforming methods that fine-tune models. Moreover, DiffRate discovers optimal compression rates using only 1,000 training images and converges within 2.7 GPU hours. The visualizations also show that DiffRate successfully identifies and removes redundant background tokens while merging less informative foreground tokens. Overall, DiffRate provides an efficient and unified framework for token compression in ViTs. The differentiable compression rate is a novel concept that could pave the way for further advancements.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel token compression method called Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate) for efficient vision transformers (ViTs). DiffRate introduces a differentiable optimization approach to determine the optimal compression rate (ratio of removed tokens) in each transformer block. To achieve this, it employs a Differentiable Discrete Proxy (DDP) module which consists of two components - a token sorting procedure based on importance metrics like class attention, and a reparameterization trick using a set of discrete candidate compression rates and their learnable selection probabilities. By translating compression rate optimization into probability learning, DDP allows end-to-end training to find the optimal compression rates under different computation constraints. Moreover, DiffRate unifies token pruning and merging within the same framework by compressing in two steps - pruning unimportant tokens first and then merging unimportant remaining tokens. Experiments show DiffRate outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in compressing various ViTs without fine-tuning. The optimization process is also highly efficient, converging within just 2-3 epochs.
