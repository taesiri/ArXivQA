# [DiffRate : Differentiable Compression Rate for Efficient Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17997)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we optimize the token compression rate in vision transformers (ViTs) in a differentiable manner to achieve efficient and effective compression? 

More specifically, the key points are:

- Current token compression methods like pruning and merging rely on manually selecting the compression rate (number of tokens to remove) per layer, which is suboptimal. 

- The paper proposes a novel differentiable compression rate framework called DiffRate to automatically learn the optimal layer-wise compression rates with end-to-end gradient optimization.

- DiffRate allows jointly optimizing compression via pruning and merging in a unified framework with a differentiable compression rate.

- A novel differentiable discrete proxy (DDP) module is introduced to enable gradient-based learning of discrete compression rates.

- Experiments show DiffRate outperforms prior arts in compressing various ViTs without fine-tuning, and is efficient, flexible, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that making the compression rate in token pruning/merging differentiable can lead to more effective and efficient compression of ViTs compared to hand-designed or input-adaptive compression rates. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new token compression framework called Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate) that formulates token compression as an optimization problem and makes the compression rate differentiable. 

2. It introduces a novel Differentiable Discrete Proxy (DDP) module that enables optimizing the compression rate with gradient backpropagation. DDP consists of a token sorting procedure and a reparameterization trick.

3. It unifies token pruning and merging into a single framework by integrating them in a differentiable manner using the learned compression rates.

4. Experiments show that DiffRate achieves state-of-the-art performance on compressing various vision transformers without fine-tuning the models. For example, it reduces 40% FLOPs on ViT-H with only 0.16% accuracy drop.

5. DiffRate demonstrates several appealing properties:
- It automatically learns layer-wise compression rates.
- It is highly efficient, converging the compression rate within 2.7 GPU hours. 
- It works well even with only 1,000 images for compression rate optimization.

In summary, the core innovation is formulating token compression as an optimization problem with differentiable compression rates. This allows jointly optimizing pruning and merging in a unified framework to achieve better efficiency-accuracy trade-off. DiffRate provides an effective way to improve vision transformers for practical usage.
