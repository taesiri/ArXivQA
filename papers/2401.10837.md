## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper examines the domain of aerial field robotics, focusing specifically on micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) operating in real-world environments that present challenges for safe navigation. Key issues limiting wider adoption of MAVs include lack of resilience in aspects like control, perception, path planning and decision-making when faced with unpredictable situations, obscurants/poor lighting, lack of visual or geometric texture, collisions, etc.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes evaluating aerial robotic autonomy using a framework of resilience with three main virtues - robustness, redundancy and resourcefulness. The paper reviews state-of-the-art developments in resilient embodiment designs, control schemes, multi-modal sensing and perception methods, planning and exploration techniques, as well as complementary data fusion algorithms. Approaches for resilience include collision-tolerance, shape reconfigurability, multi-sensor fusion, health-aware mapping, risk-aware planning and learning-based policies.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a principled perspective and virtues (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness) for understanding progress in resilient aerial autonomy
- Reviews latest techniques and open challenges in key sub-areas - resilient embodiment, control, perception and planning
- Highlights pioneering achievements, competitions (SubT, FLA, MBZIRC, AlphaPilot) and teams furthering resilience 
- Identifies and discusses major limitations currently prohibiting wider field deployment of resilient MAVs
- Suggests areas for future work - improved endurance and physical interaction, scalable mapping, computational planning costs, collaborative multi-robot planning, direct navigation policies from sensor data  

In summary, the paper surveys the state-of-the-art and bottlenecks in resilient aerial field robotics, providing a helpful organization of core technical elements needed to equip MAVs with the ability to reliably operate in real-world environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is to provide a survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art in resilient aerial robotics, with a focus on micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Specifically, the paper:

1) Defines the concept of "resilience" for aerial robotic autonomy in terms of robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness. 

2) Overviews key elements that contribute to resilience in MAVs: embodiment design, control, perception, planning. For each element, the paper summarizes recent research progress and open challenges.

3) Highlights pioneering results demonstrated in major robotics competitions like the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and AlphaPilot. These competitions have accelerated progress towards resilient autonomy for real-world complex environments.  

4) Discusses limitations and open research problems prohibiting wider and more effective deployment of resilient aerial robots, including issues with endurance, physical interaction, perceptual degradation, scalable representations and planning, and learning-based policies. 

In summary, the paper provides a broad survey and insightful analysis of the state of resilient aerial robotics focused on MAVs, summarizing progress, applications, and open questions to guide and motivate future research towards truly field-hardened systems. The central contribution is painting this comprehensive picture across the autonomy stack in the context of resilience.
