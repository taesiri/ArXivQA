# [PRISE: Demystifying Deep Lucas-Kanade with Strongly Star-Convex   Constraints for Multimodel Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11526)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the accuracy and robustness of the Lucas-Kanade (LK) algorithm for multimodal image alignment. Specifically, the paper aims to address the issue of poor local optimality that the LK method often suffers from when aligning image pairs with large distortions. The main hypothesis is that enforcing deep neural networks to learn approximately star-convex loss landscapes around the ground truth will facilitate the convergence of the LK method to the global optimum through gradient descent.In summary, the key research question is: Can imposing star-convex constraints on deep network training improve the accuracy and robustness of the LK method for multimodal image alignment? The hypothesis is that learning approximately star-convex loss landscapes will guide the LK method to find better solutions.
