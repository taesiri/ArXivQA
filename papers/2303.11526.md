# [PRISE: Demystifying Deep Lucas-Kanade with Strongly Star-Convex   Constraints for Multimodel Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11526)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the accuracy and robustness of the Lucas-Kanade (LK) algorithm for multimodal image alignment. Specifically, the paper aims to address the issue of poor local optimality that the LK method often suffers from when aligning image pairs with large distortions. The main hypothesis is that enforcing deep neural networks to learn approximately star-convex loss landscapes around the ground truth will facilitate the convergence of the LK method to the global optimum through gradient descent.In summary, the key research question is: Can imposing star-convex constraints on deep network training improve the accuracy and robustness of the LK method for multimodal image alignment? The hypothesis is that learning approximately star-convex loss landscapes will guide the LK method to find better solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new method called PRISE (Dee\underline{p} Sta\underline{r}-Convexif\underline{i}ed Luca\underline{s}-Kanad\underline{e}) for multimodel image alignment. The key contributions are:- They introduce strongly star-convex constraints into the training of deep neural networks for Lucas-Kanade (LK) based homography estimation. This helps reshape the loss landscape of LK to be more convex-like around the ground truth solution. - They formulate the training as a minimax problem with contrastive losses derived from the definition of strong star-convexity. This leads to an adversarial training framework.- They provide an efficient sampling-based algorithm to train the network with star-convex constraints, which helps reduce computational complexity. - They analyze the quality of the solutions obtained from PRISE based on the star-convex loss landscapes. - They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of PRISE on multimodel image alignment tasks on benchmark datasets like MSCOCO, GoogleEarth, and GoogleMap. PRISE significantly outperforms previous methods especially when the pixel error is small.In summary, the main contribution is the novel PRISE framework that introduces strongly star-convex constraints into deep network training to reshape the loss landscape and achieve better convergence for LK based multimodel image alignment. The effectiveness is shown through extensive experiments and analysis.
