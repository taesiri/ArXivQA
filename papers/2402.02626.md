# [Position bias in features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02626)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Document-specific historical click-through rates can be important features for search engine ranking models that update over time. However, these features are biased by position bias - the tendency for users to click more on higher ranked search results irrespective of relevance.  

- Existing methods to correct for position bias like inverse propensity weighting (IPW) can have high variance, especially for new documents with little click data. This can hurt ranking performance compared to using the biased but lower variance raw click-through rates.

Solution:
- The paper formally defines and analyzes the properties of various position bias corrected click features:
  - IPW click-through rate (IPW-CTR): Unbiased but high variance
  - Clicks over expected clicks (COEC): Also unbiased, can have lower variance than IPW-CTR
  - Biased CTR: Lower variance but does not correct for position bias
  
- It shows through simulations that biased CTR can outperform IPW-CTR for ranking, especially with smaller sample sizes per document

Main Contributions:
- Establishes the usefulness of document-specific historical click features for search ranking, in contrast to the literature's focus on query-document relevance 

- Formal analysis of IPW-CTR, COEC and other click features, proving COEC is an unbiased estimator of document relevance

- Demonstrates through controlled experiments that accurate position bias estimation is more important than the choice of IPW vs COEC weighting

- Shows that using inaccurate empirical position bias estimates severely damages ranking performance 

- Advocates for a pluralistic approach of using both biased and unbiased click features rather than relying solely on unbiased estimators


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies different click features for search ranking, finding that inverse propensity weighted metrics can approximate relevance but have high variance, such that biased click rates can sometimes outperform them, and accurate position bias estimation is more important than the choice between IPW, COEC, or SNIPS weighting schemes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Establishing the notion and usefulness of document relevance as a concept, in contrast to the more common query-document relevance. Document relevance has predictive power for ranking in subsequent searches.

2) Formally defining and analyzing the properties of several click-based features: click-through rate (CTR), inverse propensity weighted CTR (IPW-CTR), empirical weighted CTR, clicks over expected clicks (COEC), and inverse propensity weighted COEC (IPW-COEC).

3) Showing that while IPW-CTR is an unbiased estimator of relevance, its high variance can hurt ranking performance compared to the biased but lower variance CTR. Accurate position bias estimation is critical.

4) Demonstrating through simulations that IPW-COEC often has lower variance than IPW-CTR and so may be a better ranking feature, though the choice between CTR and COEC matters less than using accurate position bias weights.

5) Advocating for a pluralistic approach of using multiple position-bias-adjusted click features rather than just an unbiased estimator.

In summary, the main contribution is a formal analysis of multiple click-based features for document ranking, highlighting the tradeoffs between biased and unbiased estimators in terms of variance and ranking performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it appear to be:

- position bias
- search ranking
- learning to rank
- inverse propensity scoring
- inverse propensity weighting (IPW)
- propensity estimation
- click-through rate (CTR)
- clicks over expected clicks (COEC)
- examination probability
- relevance

The paper discusses position bias in search ranking and learning to rank systems. It formally defines and analyzes features like inverse propensity weighted CTR (IPW-CTR), biased CTR, clicks over expected clicks (COEC), etc. It also examines concepts like relevance and examination probability in the context of search engines and ranking systems. The analysis includes mathematical proofs, simulations, and experiments comparing the properties and performance of these different click-based features. So the key terms reflect these main topics and concepts covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that document relevance is a useful predictive concept. Can you expand more on why this concept might have value over the more traditional notion of query-document relevance? What are some examples of how it could be applied?

2. In the proof that empirical-CTR is biased upwards relative to relevance, it is assumed that the empirical position bias weights overestimate true position bias. Can you walk through the implications if instead they underestimated true position bias? 

3. The paper claims IPW-CTR has high variance that increases with position bias, while CTR has bounded low variance. Can you formally prove bounds on the variance of these two estimators? What are the tightest possible bounds you can prove?

4. When discussing the consequences for ranking, the paper argues IPW-CTR could show low relevance documents at the top of rankings. Can you propose an algorithmic solution to address this issue while retaining the benefits of IPW-CTR?

5. The experiments show CTR often outperforming IPW-CTR. What changes could be made to the experimental setup that would likely lead to IPW-CTR more consistently outperforming CTR?

6. The paper emphasizes a pluralistic view of using multiple position-adjusted features. Can you propose a model or algorithm that would optimize the combination of multiple such features? 

7. The similarity in performance between IPW-CTR and IPW-COEC seems dependent on the degree of position bias. Can you formally prove the conditions under which they would be equivalent estimators? When would they differ?

8. The experiments use a simple ranking model with only one feature. How might the relative performance of features change if using a more complex multi-feature model?

9. The poor performance of empirical weights is attributed to overestimated position bias. Can you propose an algorithm to estimate position bias such that resulting empirical weights would perform well? 

10. The paper focuses on historical click features useful for ranking. Can you propose entirely different historical features that could prove useful for ranking in subsequent searches?
