# [GenTranslate: Large Language Models are Generative Multilingual Speech   and Machine Translators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced speech and machine translation, but most models still use beam search and select only the top-1 hypothesis, discarding other translation candidates that could provide useful information. This is suboptimal for generating a single, high-quality translation output.

Proposed Solution - GenTranslate:  
- Proposes a new generative paradigm that leverages the reasoning abilities of LLMs to integrate information from the diverse N-best translation candidates from the foundation model and generate an improved final translation.

- Releases HypoTranslate dataset with 592K pairs of N-best hypotheses and reference translations in 11 languages to support LLM finetuning.

- Employs efficient LLaMA-Adapter finetuning that inserts adapters into LLM Transformer layers to enable fast, task-specific tuning.  

- Formulates loss function and training strategy to optimize LLM as a sequence-to-sequence model to map N-best hypotheses to reference translation.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes GenTranslate, a new generative paradigm for translation that harnesses LLM's reasoning over N-best candidates.

- Releases large-scale HypoTranslate dataset containing N-best hypothesis and reference pairs.

- Achieves new SOTA results on speech translation (30.1 vs 27.1 BLUE on FLEURS) and machine translation (38.5 vs 37.5 BLUE on FLORES), significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

- Analysis shows GenTranslate can integrate information and generate words beyond those in N-best, demonstrating strong reasoning abilities.

In summary, the key innovation is leveraging LLMs and dataset of N-best candidates to generate improved final translations via a new generative paradigm. Both the method and dataset are impactful contributions to speech and machine translation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GenTranslate, a new generative paradigm for translation tasks that leverages large language models to integrate diverse candidates from the decoded N-best list and generate higher-quality translation output.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. It proposes GenTranslate, a new generative paradigm for translation tasks that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate higher-quality translation results based on the diverse N-best hypotheses decoded from a foundation translation model. 

2. It releases a HypoTranslate dataset to support LLM finetuning for GenTranslate, which contains over 592K pairs of N-best hypotheses and ground-truth translations in 11 languages.

3. Experiments on various speech translation and machine translation benchmarks show that the proposed GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models. For example, it achieves over 3.0 BLEU score improvement on average over models like SeamlessM4T.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the GenTranslate paradigm that effectively integrates the strengths of foundation translation models and LLMs to boost translation performance. The released dataset and comprehensive experiments further verify the effectiveness of this paradigm.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on leveraging recent advances in large language models such as LLaMA, ChatGPT, etc. for translation tasks.

- Generative translation: The paper proposes a new generative paradigm called "GenTranslate" which utilizes the reasoning abilities of LLMs to generate higher quality translations from diverse beam search hypotheses.  

- Beam search hypotheses: The paper emphasizes integrating information from the N-best hypotheses from beam search rather than just using the top hypothesis.

- Speech translation (ST) and machine translation (MT): The paper evaluates the proposed approach on both speech translation and text-based machine translation tasks/benchmarks.

- HypoTranslate dataset: A new dataset released containing 592K hypothesis-translation pairs in 11 languages to support LLM finetuning for the proposed approach.

- Multilingual: The approach is evaluated for translation involving multiple language pairs in both directions (X->En and En->X).

- Efficient LLM finetuning: The paper utilizes adapter-based tuning strategies like LLaMA-Adapter for efficient finetuning of large LLMs.

In summary, the key focus is on using LLMs in a generative paradigm for improving translation quality by better integrating beam search hypotheses, evaluated on both speech and text translation tasks.
