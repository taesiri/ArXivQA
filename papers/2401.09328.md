# [Online Stability Improvement of Groebner Basis Solvers using Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Gröbner basis solvers are important for solving polynomial systems in computer vision problems like structure from motion. However, different variable orderings and elimination templates can lead to large variability in accuracy for the same problem instance.
- Choosing a single elimination template offline limits flexibility and robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- For a class of "permutation invariant" polynomial systems, variable reordering translates to column permutation of the coefficient matrix.
- This allows reusing the same elimination template in different ways by permuting coefficients.
- A classifier is introduced to predict the best permutation for each instance, enabling online selection.

Contributions:
- Show variable reordering can significantly impact solver stability for vision problems.
- Define "permutation invariant" polynomial systems where permutations enable reusing one elimination template.
- Prove coefficient matrix contains enough information to train a classifier to predict best permutation.
- Classifier enables online selection of elimination template at low computational overhead.
- Demonstrate wide applicability, including improvement in accuracy for generic dense solvers and absolute pose estimation.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to improve numerical stability of Gröbner basis solvers by predicting the best permutation of variables for each problem instance. This is achieved for "permutation invariant" systems by reusing the same elimination template in different ways. The viability is shown by improved accuracy on both synthetic and real computer vision solvers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas presented in the paper:

The paper proposes using a neural network classifier to efficiently predict at online stage a suitable permutation of the variables in a permutation invariant polynomial system in order to improve the numerical stability of a Gröbner basis solver applied to the system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. It demonstrates that for a class of polynomial systems that are "permutation invariant", simple variable reordering translates to column permutations of the original coefficient matrix. This allows using a single elimination template in different ways, each potentially leading to different numerical stability. The paper shows this can have a significant impact on solver accuracy.

2. It shows that the original coefficients contain enough information to train a neural network classifier to predict a good permutation for each problem instance. This enables online selection of a suitable permutation at little additional computational cost, thereby improving the numerical stability and accuracy of solvers.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to improve the accuracy and robustness of a class of Gröbner basis solvers by using a lightweight neural network to select a good ordering/permutation at runtime. The key ideas are exploiting permutation invariance and learning to predict good permutations from the coefficient data.

To summarize, the paper discusses using Gröbner basis solvers for solving polynomial systems in geometric computer vision problems. It shows that different variable orderings can lead to differences in numerical stability when using the same elimination template. For a class of permutation invariant polynomial systems, it demonstrates that variable reordering translates to column permutations in the coefficient matrix. This allows reusing the same elimination template in different ways for improved stability. The paper then proposes training a deep neural network on synthetic data to predict a good column permutation in an online manner, demonstrating improved solver accuracy on both synthetic and real geometric vision problems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of permutation invariant polynomial systems. Can you explain in more detail what makes a polynomial system permutation invariant and why this property enables the reuse of a single elimination template? 

2. The paper shows that variable reordering impacts the numerical stability of Gröbner basis solvers. Can you expand on the reasons why different variable orderings can lead to different numerical conditioning?

3. The method relies on training a neural network classifier to predict a good permutation from the original coefficients. What is the architecture of this classifier and what type of training procedure and loss function is used?

4. The paper uses training data augmentation to make the classifier permutation invariant. Can you explain in more detail why this is necessary and how the augmented data is generated? 

5. What are the differences in results between problems with few vs. many variables and lower vs. higher order polynomial systems? Why does the method work better for some cases than others?

6. The paper tests the method on generic dense polynomial systems as well as a camera resectioning algorithm. Can you compare and contrast the results, and discuss why geometric vision problems are well suited for this approach?

7. What changes would need to be made to apply this method to partially permutation invariant systems or cases with multiple possible elimination templates? 

8. Can you think of other areas, besides geometric vision, where permutation invariant or nearly permutation invariant polynomial systems commonly arise?

9. The paper claims improved efficiency from being able to reuse a single elimination template. Can you analyze the computational complexity and quantify the efficiency gains?

10. The method relies on synthetic training data. What are some ways the quality and diversity of this training data could be improved to enable better generalization?
