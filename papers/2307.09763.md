# [Towards Building More Robust Models with Frequency Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09763)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can the frequency characteristics of robust neural network models be better utilized to improve adversarial robustness?More specifically, the paper investigates:- The frequency biases exhibited by vanilla vs robust models, finding that robust models emphasize low-frequency information. - How to leverage this insight by proposing a module called Frequency Preference Control Module (FPCM) that can reconfigure the low/high frequency components of intermediate feature representations to enhance robustness.- Demonstrating the efficacy of FPCM to boost robustness across models/datasets when combined with adversarial training.- Providing analysis on how the frequency bias impacts model robustness and the adversarial training process.So in summary, the central goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how frequency characteristics relate to model robustness, and to use those insights to develop techniques to further enhance adversarial robustness. The FPCM module and experiments around it provide a way to effectively utilize frequency bias for more robust learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing the Frequency Preference Control Module (FPCM) that can adaptively reconfigure the low- and high-frequency components of intermediate feature representations in neural networks. This module can be easily incorporated into any adversarial training framework to further improve model robustness.- Using the proposed FPCM to study how the frequency characteristics of robust models impact their adversarial robustness. Experiments reveal insights like: 1) Adversarially trained models rely more on low-frequency signals compared to vanilla models which are biased towards high-frequency texture features. 2) Explicitly enhancing the proportion of low-frequency features in CNNs via the FPCM leads to improved robustness. - Demonstrating that the FPCM generalizes well across different model architectures (e.g. ResNets, Wide ResNets) and datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Imagenette). The module can be combined with various adversarial training methods like PGD-AT, TRADES, AWP and provide consistent robustness gains.- Showing that the FPCM yields higher robust accuracy while retaining better performance on clean images compared to prior frequency-based defense methods that apply low-pass filtering directly on the input.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a simple yet effective module to manipulate frequency characteristics of intermediate features for improved adversarial robustness, along with insights obtained through experiments regarding how frequency bias impacts robust learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a Frequency Preference Control Module that can be incorporated into adversarial training frameworks to improve model robustness by adaptively reconfiguring the low- and high-frequency components of intermediate feature representations, and uses this module to provide insights into how the frequency bias of robust models impacts their adversarial training process and final robustness.
