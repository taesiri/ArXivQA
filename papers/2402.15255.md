# [Optimal Transport for Structure Learning Under Missing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the problem of learning causal structures from data with missing values, which introduces a chicken-and-egg dilemma. Robust imputation requires considering the causal dependencies among variables, but the causal structure is unknown. On the other hand, simply imputing the missing values using standard methods and then performing causal discovery leads to sub-optimal performance. This is empirically demonstrated in the paper. Therefore, specialized methods are needed that can perform causal discovery directly from data with missing values.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a method called OTM (Optimal Transport for Missing data) for causal structure learning from missing data. The key idea is to formulate the problem as finding a structural causal model (SCM) that makes the model distribution closest in Wasserstein distance to the empirical distribution of the observed data. This avoids needing to explicitly model the missing data distribution or mechanism. 

OTM uses a stochastic map to map the distribution of the imputed data to the model distribution induced by the candidate SCM. It then minimizes the expected reconstruction error between the original imputed data and the data reconstructed from the samples of the model distribution. An additional distribution matching term based on maximum mean discrepancy is used to ensure the model distribution matches what the stochastic map produces. The method can use any existing causal discovery algorithm for complete data as a base.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates causal structure learning from missing data as an optimal transport problem between the empirical and model distributions.
- Proposes a theoretically-grounded objective function that avoids needing to explicitly model missing data distribution.  
- Can flexibly incorporate any score-based causal discovery method for complete data.
- Empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with various missingness mechanisms. 
- Analysis shows the method is more robust and scalable compared to existing approaches like MissDAG.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions towards enabling reliable causal discovery directly from incomplete observational data.
