# [Unsupervised self-organising map of prostate cell Raman spectra shows   disease-state subclustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prostate cancer poses a difficult question of whether to treat it or not since many forms are indolent while some are aggressive. Current diagnostic methods have limitations in risk-stratifying patients.
- New approaches are needed to subclassify prostate cancer at a biomolecular level to guide more targeted and personalized treatment decisions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use an unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) machine learning approach to analyze Raman spectroscopy data collected at the single-cell level from prostate cell lines. 
- Test if SOMs can differentiate cancer from normal cells and reveal cancer subclusters linked to disease characteristics.

Methods:
- Raman spectra collected from live individual cells of normal prostate line (PNT2-C2) and cancerous line (LNCaP). 
- 284 high-dimensional Raman spectra used as input to SOM with no dimensionality reduction, only standard preprocessing.
- SOM method is fully unsupervised with blinded dataset.
- Parameters optimized through testing for SOM topology and training.

Results:
- SOM clearly separates normal and cancer cell lines into distinct clusters.
- Unexpected further subclustering found in the cancer cell line related to differences in lipid content - saturated fatty acids versus unsaturated.
- Indicates SOMs can subclassify disease states based on biomolecular signatures.

Conclusions:
- Demonstrates feasibility of using unsupervised SOMs to cluster high-dimensional Raman spectra data from complex biological systems. 
- Reveals potential to substratify prostate cancer and link subclusters to disease characteristics.
- Future work to further analyze biological relevance of subclusters regarding signaling lipids.

Key contributions:
- First application of unsupervised SOMs to cluster high-dimensional, real system Raman spectra data without dimensionality reduction  
- Successful subclustering of prostate cancer line suggesting capability to reveal new disease subclasses linked to molecular signatures
- Proof-of-feasibility for using SOMs to subclassify cancer from normal cells and distinguish disease states
