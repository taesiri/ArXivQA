# [Nested Diffusion Processes for Anytime Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research question addressed in this paper is how to enable diffusion models to generate high-quality intermediate image predictions during the sampling process, rather than only at the end. The central hypothesis is that by nesting an inner diffusion process within the steps of an outer diffusion process, the intermediate predictions will better align with the learned image manifold and exhibit higher quality compared to vanilla diffusion models.In summary, the paper introduces Nested Diffusion in order to transform diffusion models into anytime algorithms that can yield usable image samples at arbitrary points during generation, rather than having to run the full sampling process to completion. The nested structure allows for iterative refinement of the intermediate predictions.
