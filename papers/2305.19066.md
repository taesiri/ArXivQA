# [Nested Diffusion Processes for Anytime Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research question addressed in this paper is how to enable diffusion models to generate high-quality intermediate image predictions during the sampling process, rather than only at the end. The central hypothesis is that by nesting an inner diffusion process within the steps of an outer diffusion process, the intermediate predictions will better align with the learned image manifold and exhibit higher quality compared to vanilla diffusion models.In summary, the paper introduces Nested Diffusion in order to transform diffusion models into anytime algorithms that can yield usable image samples at arbitrary points during generation, rather than having to run the full sampling process to completion. The nested structure allows for iterative refinement of the intermediate predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Nested Diffusion, a novel technique that allows diffusion models to be used as anytime algorithms. Specifically:- Nested Diffusion composes two diffusion processes - an "inner" and "outer" diffusion - allowing iterative refinement of generated images. This enables access to higher quality intermediate predictions compared to vanilla diffusion models.- By providing good intermediate results, Nested Diffusion transforms standard diffusion models into anytime algorithms that can be stopped early and still provide satisfactory outputs. - Experiments demonstrate Nested Diffusion's superior intermediate image quality on class-conditional ImageNet generation and text-to-image synthesis with Stable Diffusion, while maintaining comparable final results to vanilla diffusion.- The paper shows Nested Diffusion's versatility through applications like inverse problem solving and human-guided image generation. The method's intermediate outputs allow users to steer generation based on visual feedback.- A novel metric is introduced to quantify the tradeoff between update frequency and quality for anytime algorithms. This helps compare different configurations of Nested Diffusion.In summary, the key innovation is using nested diffusion processes to convert existing diffusion models into flexible anytime algorithms with enhanced intermediate outputs. This expands the applicability and improves the efficiency of diffusion-based image generation.
