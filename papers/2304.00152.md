# [Learning the Distribution of Errors in Stereo Matching for Joint   Disparity and Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00152)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we jointly estimate disparity and uncertainty in a way that improves performance in both tasks? The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a novel loss function based on KL divergence between the distributions of disparity errors and predicted uncertainties. This forces the network to learn to predict uncertainties that match the actual error distribution.- Using a differentiable soft-histogramming technique to approximate the error and uncertainty distributions for computing the KL divergence loss.- Designing a lightweight uncertainty estimation subnetwork integrated with a stereo matching network (GwcNet) that takes intermediate disparity predictions as input. - Showing experimentally that the proposed approach (SEDNet) outperforms baselines in both disparity estimation and uncertainty prediction, demonstrating the benefits of joint training.So in summary, the paper presents a method for joint disparity and uncertainty estimation that leverages statistics of the errors to supervise the uncertainty prediction. The key innovation is the proposed loss function based on matching uncertainty and error distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A novel uncertainty estimation subnetwork that extracts information from the intermediate multi-resolution disparity maps generated by the disparity subnetwork.2. A differentiable soft-histogramming technique used to approximate the distributions of disparity errors and estimated uncertainties. 3. A loss based on KL divergence applied on histograms obtained with the above technique to match the distribution of uncertainties with the distribution of disparity errors.4. Extensive experiments showing that the proposed method, named SEDNet, outperforms baselines in both disparity estimation and uncertainty prediction on large datasets. The key idea is to require the distribution of predicted uncertainty values to match the distribution of disparity errors, so that uncertainty acts as a good predictor of the error magnitude. This is achieved by minimizing the KL divergence between the two distributions approximated via soft histogramming. The network architecture consists of a stereo matching subnetwork based on GwcNet plus a very small uncertainty estimation subnetwork. Experiments demonstrate that SEDNet improves disparity accuracy compared to just training GwcNet, while also providing accurate uncertainty maps.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper presents a novel deep learning method for joint disparity and uncertainty estimation in stereo matching that improves both tasks by matching the distribution of uncertainties to the distribution of disparity errors via a KL divergence loss term.
