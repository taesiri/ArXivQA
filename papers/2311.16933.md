# [SparseCtrl: Adding Sparse Controls to Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16933)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SparseCtrl, an efficient approach for controlling text-to-video generation with temporally sparse signals such as sketches, depth maps, or RGB images. It works by training an add-on sparse condition encoder network on top of a pre-trained text-to-video backbone, without needing to retrain the backbone model. The encoder incorporates temporal propagation layers to help propagate sparse keyframe conditions to other frames. SparseCtrl is shown to enable controllable generation for a variety of applications including sketch-to-video, depth-guided rendering, image animation, and video interpolation/prediction. Experiments validate its effectiveness in controlling both original and personalized text-to-video models across different sparse signal modalities. The method provides more practical control for video generation compared to approaches that require dense frame-wise conditions. Limitations include reliance on the dataset diversity and domain of the pre-trained model.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents SparseCtrl, an efficient approach for controlling text-to-video generation by training an add-on encoder network to incorporate temporally sparse condition signals like sketches, depth maps, or RGB images into a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model, enhancing controllability while leaving the original model untouched.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting SparseCtrl, an efficient approach for adding temporally sparse control signals (such as sketches, depth maps, or RGB images) to pre-trained text-to-video generators via an add-on encoder network. Key aspects of SparseCtrl include:

- It leaves the original text-to-video model untouched and only trains an auxiliary sparse condition encoder, making it easy to add control to pre-trained models without costly retraining.

- The encoder uses temporal propagation layers to spread sparse control signals from conditioned keyframes to unconditioned frames, enhancing temporal consistency.

- It eliminates noised sample inputs to the encoder to prevent quality degradation. 

- Masking during training allows it to handle varying degrees of sparsity and unify different control modalities and applications in a single framework.

- It demonstrates generalized compatibility with both original and personalized text-to-video generators.

- It enables various applications like sketch-to-video, depth-guided rendering, image animation, keyframe interpolation etc. with just sparse control signals.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and flexible approach to add sparse control signals to pre-trained text-to-video generators, unlocking enhanced controllability for practical applications.
