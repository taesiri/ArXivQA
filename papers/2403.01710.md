# [Sensor-based Multi-Robot Search and Coverage with Spatial Separation in   Unstructured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-robot systems are useful for search and coverage tasks in unknown environments, but balancing efficiency and successful task completion is challenging, especially in expansive, unstructured environments with dense obstacles. 
- Existing methods either rely on exhaustive search, compromising efficiency, or are reactive but get trapped in local minima due to short-sighted decisions.
- Most methods assume structured 2D environments and convex obstacles, not realistic for raw sensor data.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel decentralized Voronoi-based approach for efficient search and coverage of targets of interest (ToI) in non-convex, unstructured 3D environments.
- Uses only local sensing information through spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring to efficiently construct collision-free Voronoi cells from raw point cloud data.
- Employs a deadlock-aware guided map, integrating a gradient-based navigation function and Voronoi centroids, to avoid local minima and navigate towards ToI.  

Main Contributions:
- Directly handles raw point cloud data for obstacles without needing post-processing or convexity assumptions.
- Decentralized approach guarantees safety through buffered Voronoi cells generated via efficient spatial techniques.
- First Voronoi-based method proven to avoid local minima entrapment in general unstructured environments.
- Significantly improves coverage ratio, success rate and efficiency over state-of-the-art in extensive high-fidelity simulations.
- Demonstrates robust performance across diverse dense environments including forests and offices.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative decentralized multi-robot approach using only local information to efficiently search and cover targets in complex unstructured environments while guaranteeing safety and avoidance of local minima. Simulations validate clear improvements over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a decentralized Voronoi-based approach for multi-robot search and coverage in unstructured environments that uses spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring to efficiently construct collision-free Voronoi regions from local sensor data and integrates these regions with a deadlock-aware guided map to improve efficiency and avoid local minima.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel decentralized Voronoi-based active search and coverage strategy for unknown and unstructured environments with guaranteed safety. Specifically, the key aspects are:

1) Efficiently generating collision-free Voronoi regions directly from point cloud data using only local sensing information through spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring techniques. This avoids needing to maintain additional cost maps.

2) Constructing a deadlock-aware guided map integrated with a gradient-optimized, centroid Voronoi-based coverage control policy. This helps improve efficiency by avoiding exhaustive searches and local sensing pitfalls that can trap robots. 

3) Extensive validation through simulations demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate, coverage ratio, and task execution time compared to other methods. The approach is shown to be applicable across diverse environments including cluttered, thin-structural, and narrow settings while ensuring safety.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel decentralized multi-robot coverage control method that works directly on raw point cloud data from sensors to efficiently generate secured Voronoi cells and integrate guidance to prevent robots getting stuck, outperforming existing techniques.
