# [STF: Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module for Improving Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10752)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Relying only on single image frames for object detection has limitations - objects may be occluded, blurred, too small, etc which leads to poor feature quality
- Using multiple frames can provide complementary info about objects over time to address these issues 
- But simply combining features from multiple frames is non-trivial due to misalignments across frames

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) framework to effectively utilize information from multiple frames 
- Uses a Multi-Frame Attention (MFA) module to assign adaptive weights to features from current and prior frames, enhancing occluded/blurred objects
- Uses a Single-Frame Attention (SFA) module to refine features within each frame via channel/spatial attention  
- Proposes a dual-frame fusion module to merge the above multi-frame and single-frame features

Main Contributions:
- Multi-Frame Attention module to assign temporal adaptive weights to features from two frames
- Single-Frame Attention module for spatial/channel attention within each frame
- Dual-frame fusion module to combine enhanced single and multi-frame features
- Evaluated on KITTI, Cityscapes and UAVDT datasets, achieves state-of-the-art detection performance

In summary, the paper proposes a novel attention-based spatio-temporal fusion approach to effectively combine features from multiple frames for improved video object detection, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.
