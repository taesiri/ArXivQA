# [Language Models are Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03057)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How well do large language models perform on tasks requiring complex reasoning in multilingual settings?

More specifically, the key aspects investigated in this paper are:

1. Introducing a new multilingual benchmark, MGSM, for evaluating arithmetic reasoning of language models across diverse languages. 

2. Analyzing the ability of large models like GPT-3 and PaLM to perform multi-step reasoning and solve MGSM problems when provided with chain-of-thought prompting in various languages.

3. Demonstrating that these models exhibit strong cross-lingual transfer and can solve reasoning problems even in low-resource languages not well represented in their training data.

4. Extending the multilingual reasoning evaluation to other tasks like commonsense reasoning (XCOPA) and word sense disambiguation (XL-WiC) and showing competitive performance.

5. Overall, the paper aims to comprehensively evaluate and highlight the emerging cross-lingual reasoning capabilities of large language models when presented with explicit reasoning chains, even with little or no training data in the target languages. The introduction of MGSM and the analysis help demonstrate these abilities.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that large language models have acquired strong latent skills in multilingual reasoning that can be revealed through chain-of-thought prompting, even in low-resource languages. The empirical evaluations and new benchmark aim to demonstrate that.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing the Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) benchmark, which is the first multilingual arithmetic reasoning benchmark. This is created by manually translating a subset of the English GSM8K dataset into 10 diverse languages. 

2. Comprehensively evaluating the multilingual reasoning abilities of large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM on multiple tasks, including the new MGSM benchmark. Key findings are:

- Models show surprisingly good reasoning abilities even in underrepresented languages. For PaLM-540B, accuracy on MGSM is only 3% lower for underrepresented vs high-resource languages. 

- Intermediate reasoning steps in English lead to competitive or better performance than reasoning in the native language across settings.

- Multilingual reasoning is an emergent property of scale - it substantially improves from 62B to 540B parameters for PaLM.

3. Demonstrating that multilingual reasoning abilities extend beyond arithmetic to commonsense reasoning (on XCOPA dataset) and word sense disambiguation (XL-WiC dataset). Using few-shot prompting, PaLM-540B achieves new SOTA results on XCOPA, outperforming prior approaches requiring full training.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing a new multilingual reasoning benchmark, and providing an extensive evaluation showing that large language models exhibit surprisingly strong multilingual reasoning abilities, which emerge with scale and transfer across tasks. The results suggest models may have some inherent cross-lingual reasoning capacities beyond what is directly observed during pretraining.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The introduction of a new multilingual benchmark (MGSM) for evaluating arithmetic reasoning is a novel contribution. To my knowledge, this is the first benchmark of its kind for assessing multilingual reasoning abilities in math word problems across diverse languages. 

- The analysis of reasoning performance with chain-of-thought prompting extends prior work that has shown this technique's effectiveness for improving reasoning in English. This paper systematically explores chain-of-thought prompting in a multilingual setting across multiple models, which provides new insights.

- The finding that models exhibit strong cross-lingual transfer and can reason well even in very underrepresented languages is interesting. Some prior work has found language frequency in training data to be important, so this suggests large models may be able to overcome data scarcity to some extent through transfer.

- Demonstrating strong performance on XCOPA and XL-WiC benchmarks with multilingual chain-of-thought prompting is noteworthy. The models generalize well to new languages with very limited examples, setting new state-of-the-art results on XCOPA. This extends the applicability of this reasoning technique.

- Overall, the paper makes excellent progress on assessing and improving reasoning abilities of large language models in multilingual contexts. The new benchmark, analysis of chain-of-thought prompting effects, and strong cross-lingual transfer results meaningfully advance the field's understanding in this area.

In summary, I would say this paper makes substantive, novel contributions toward evaluating and harnessing the multilingual reasoning capabilities of large pretrained language models. The analyses and techniques should provide a strong foundation for future work on this important research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating the arithmetic reasoning abilities of language models with increasingly large scale. The authors found that the ability to solve multilingual math problems improved with larger model scale, so they suggest further scaling may continue to enhance multilingual reasoning abilities.

- Evaluating the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting on additional multilingual reasoning tasks beyond the ones explored in this paper. The authors showed the approach improved performance on math, commonsense reasoning, and word sense disambiguation tasks, so they recommend extending the analysis to other reasoning benchmarks.

- Developing optimized prompting strategies for multilingual settings. The authors found English chain-of-thought prompts were effective across languages, but suggest prompt engineering specifically for non-English languages may further improve performance.

- Analyzing the sample efficiency of language models on multilingual reasoning tasks. The authors used few-shot prompting which required minimal data, so they recommend studying how much data is needed for models to acquire reasoning skills in multiple languages.

- Investigating methods to improve reasoning for low-resource languages. The authors found strong reasoning abilities even for rare languages, but suggest developing techniques to better leverage knowledge transfer from high-resource languages.

- Creating additional multilingual reasoning benchmarks. The authors introduced a new multilingual math dataset, and suggest constructing more benchmarks requiring complex reasoning across diverse languages.

In summary, the main future directions focus on scaling models, optimizing prompting strategies, minimizing data needs, improving low-resource transfer, and building new multilingual reasoning benchmarks to analyze the reasoning capacities of language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) benchmark, which evaluates the reasoning abilities of large language models in multilingual settings. The authors manually translated 250 grade-school math problems from the GSM8K dataset into ten diverse languages. Experiments show that the ability to solve MGSM problems via chain-of-thought prompting emerges as models scale up, and models exhibit strong multilingual reasoning even for underrepresented languages like Bengali and Swahili. The paper also demonstrates that multilingual reasoning abilities extend to other tasks like commonsense reasoning and word-in-context judgment. Overall, the paper introduces a new multilingual reasoning benchmark and provides evidence that large models have impressive multilingual reasoning capacities, including on underrepresented languages and with limited training data. The benchmark and findings highlight promising future directions for developing and evaluating reasoning in multilingual models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) benchmark, which evaluates the reasoning abilities of large language models in multilingual settings. The authors manually translated 250 grade-school math problems from the existing GSM8K dataset into ten typologically diverse languages. They evaluated two large language models, GPT-3 and PaLM, on MGSM using different prompting strategies, including direct answer prediction, native language chain-of-thought, English chain-of-thought, and translation to English. The key findings are: (1) The ability to solve MGSM problems via chain-of-thought emerges with increasing model scale. (2) Models show strong multilingual reasoning abilities, even for underrepresented languages like Bengali and Swahili, with over 40% problems solved by PaLM. (3) Intermediate reasoning steps in English lead to competitive or better performance than native language steps. (4) Multilingual reasoning abilities extend to other tasks like commonsense reasoning on XCOPA. 

Overall, the paper demonstrates that large language models exhibit complex reasoning abilities across multiple languages. The introduction of MGSM enables analyzing these capabilities in an arithmetic reasoning setting across diverse languages. Key results show language models can transfer reasoning skills to underrepresented languages, and English chain-of-thought acts as a useful cross-lingual baseline. The models' strong performance on MGSM and XCOPA highlights their ability to perform multilingual multi-step reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called the Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) dataset to evaluate the multilingual reasoning abilities of large language models. The authors manually translated 250 grade-school math word problems from the existing GSM8K dataset into 10 diverse languages. They then tested two large language models, GPT-3 and PaLM, on solving these math problems using different prompting strategies, including direct answer prediction, solving with reasoning steps in the native language, solving with English reasoning steps, and translating the problem to English before solving. The models were provided with few-shot examples to elicit the desired response format. The results show that reasoning performance substantially improves for both models when intermediate reasoning steps are provided, even for underrepresented languages in the training data. The 540B parameter PaLM model in particular displays strong reasoning abilities across languages when prompted with English reasoning steps, solving over 40% of problems in all languages. This demonstrates the emergent ability of large models to perform multilingual mathematical reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models in multilingual settings. Specifically:

- They introduce a new benchmark called Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) to test arithmetic reasoning abilities across multiple languages. This helps fill a gap, as prior multilingual benchmarks focused more on simpler reasoning tasks. 

- They evaluate two large language models (GPT-3 and PaLM) on MGSM and other reasoning tasks. A key question seems to be understanding how well these models can perform reasoning not just in English but in other languages, including lower-resource ones.

- More broadly, the paper is exploring whether the progress made on chain-of-thought reasoning in English also holds up in multilingual settings. The authors aim to understand the multilingual reasoning capacities of large language models and whether their abilities transfer across languages.

In summary, the main problem is assessing and demonstrating the multilingual reasoning abilities of large language models, using new benchmarks like MGSM as well as existing reasoning tasks translated into multiple languages. A core question is whether these models exhibit strong cross-lingual transfer and generalization for complex reasoning.
