# [An LLM-Enhanced Adversarial Editing System for Lexical Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lexical simplification (LS) aims to simplify text by replacing complex words with simpler alternatives. 
- Existing LS methods rely heavily on parallel corpora which is expensive to obtain. This limits their applicability in low-resource scenarios.
- Constructing previous two-stage LS systems without parallel data is challenging as models struggle to learn transformations from complex to simplified sentences.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LAE-LS, a novel LS method without using parallel corpora. It contains:
   1) An Adversarial Editing module to predict lexical edits and identify complex words. 
   2) A Difficulty-Aware Filling module to replace masked words with simpler alternatives.
- The Editing module uses an edit predictor guided by:
   - Confusion loss to confuse discriminator about simplification level  
   - Invariance loss to preserve sentence semantics
   - LLM-enhanced loss to distill knowledge from large language models
- The Filling module is prompted to be aware of generating simpler substitutes.

Main Contributions:
- First LS approach not requiring parallel corpora, enabling low-resource application
- Adversarial Editing module with specifically designed losses to balance simplification and meaning preservation
- LLM-enhanced loss devised to transfer knowledge from large models into small LS system
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3 LS datasets, competitive to a 175B parameter model with only 220M parameters

In summary, the paper proposes a novel and effective approach to perform lexical simplification without needing annotated parallel data. A key innovation is the adversarial editing module augmented with losses to balance simplification level and semantic meaning. The smaller LS system also manages to acquire capabilities from large language models.
