# [Perennial Semantic Data Terms of Use for Decentralized Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07587)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The web has become increasingly centralized, raising privacy concerns and limiting user control over their data. Decentralized architectures like Solid aim to return control to users, but users still face the challenge of deciding which apps to trust with access to their data pods. 
- Reading lengthy terms of use agreements to make these decisions is burdensome for users. This compromises user autonomy and makes data misuse hard to detect. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a formal "perennial" data terms of use (DToU) language along with an automated DToU reasoner. 
- The language consists of a data policy (set by data provider) and an app policy (set by app developer). These express permissions, requirements, prohibitions and obligations regarding data usage.
- Automated reasoning can check compliance between policies, activate obligations, and derive policies for output data. This reduces the burden on users.

Key Contributions:
- A perennial DToU language addressing key criteria: expressing stakeholder policies, compliance checking, policy reuse across apps/users, and supporting apt data sharing across apps.
- Language and reasoning built on semantic tech like Turtle, N3 and RDF Surfaces for interoperability.
- Integration with Solid architecture and reasonable benchmark performance showing potential for large-scale deployment.  
- Paradigm shift in how users grant app permissions via automated reasoning over formally expressed perpetual policies - enhancing privacy and usability.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel formal language and reasoning system to enhance user control over data usage in decentralized architectures. Automated policy compliance checking facilitates appropriate data sharing across applications while reducing the burden on users.
