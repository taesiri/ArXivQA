# [Optimal Block-Level Draft Verification for Accelerating Speculative   Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speculative decoding is an effective method to accelerate large language models (LLMs) during inference by using a small model to draft tokens that are then verified by the large model. 
- Prior works use token-level verification where each token is verified independently. It is unclear if this is optimal for maximizing the number of accepted tokens from the draft.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the draft verification problem as a block-level optimal transport problem to directly optimize the expected number of accepted tokens.
- Propose a new linear-time algorithm called \specblock that solves this optimization problem optimally without needing additional scoring calls.
- The key ideas are: (1) backward induction to decide on block acceptance; (2) explicitly modeling residual distributions to guarantee sample validity.

Contributions:
- First work to establish improvement over speculative decoding through better draft verification beyond token-level verification.
- A new formulation and algorithm for draft verification that optimally solves the block-level optimal transport problem.
- Empirical evaluation shows consistent improvements in accepted tokens and wall-clock speedup over prior token-level verification across tasks.

In summary, this paper provides a new perspective on draft verification in speculative decoding through a block-level optimal transport formulation. The proposed \specblock algorithm efficiently achieves the optimal acceptance length and demonstrates consistent gains over standard token-level verification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new block-level draft verification algorithm for speculative decoding that provides better speedup over prior token-level verification by formulating draft verification as a block-level optimal transport problem and deriving an efficient optimal algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new draft verification algorithm for speculative decoding that provides better wall-clock speedup without incurring additional computation cost. Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the draft verification step as a block-level optimal transport problem, aiming to directly optimize the expected number of accepted tokens in one draft block. This formulation allows considering a wider range of draft verification algorithms beyond prior token-level algorithms like speculative decoding. 

2) The paper proposes an optimal algorithm for the block-level formulation that maximizes the expected acceptance length. The algorithm uses backward induction and does not require additional scoring calls to the models.

3) Empirically, the proposed block-level verification algorithm consistently outperforms the prior token-level verification method in terms of wall-clock speedup across a variety of tasks and datasets. The improvements are shown to be orthogonal to other techniques that aim to improve the drafting phase.

In summary, the key innovation is introducing a better formulation for draft verification that leads to an improved algorithm over the widely used speculative decoding method. To my knowledge, this is the first work to establish improvement purely on the verification phase.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Speculative decoding - A method to accelerate large language models during inference by using a small model to draft tokens that are then verified by the large model. 

- Draft verification - The process of verifying the tokens generated by the small "drafter" model to ensure the final output matches the distribution of the large target model. 

- Token-level verification - The standard draft verification method that checks each token independently. Referred to as "SpeculativeDecoding" in the paper.

- Block-level verification - The novel draft verification method proposed in this paper that formulates it as an optimal transport problem over an entire block of tokens. Referred to as "BlockVerify" in the paper. 

- Block efficiency - A key metric that measures the number of decoded tokens per call to the large model, which correlates with speedup.

- Optimal transport - A mathematical formulation to find an optimal plan to transport mass between distributions. Used to model the block-level verification problem.

- Conditional distributions - The distributions over next tokens conditioned on the previously generated tokens, which define language models.

- Coupling - Constructing a joint distribution between two marginal distributions, used for both token and block-level verification.

- Backward induction - An approach to incrementally reason backwards from the end of a sequence, used in the block-level verification algorithm.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper formulates the draft verification problem as a block-level optimal transport problem. How does this formulation allow for optimization of the acceptance length compared to prior token-level formulations? What specific properties of the optimal transport framework enable better optimization?

2. The proposed block verification algorithm uses backward induction to recursively compute the residual and rejected distributions. Walk through a concrete example of how these distributions are calculated over multiple induction steps. How does backward induction help overcome computational challenges?

3. What assumptions does the block verification algorithm make about the small draft model and parallel scoring (Assumptions 1 and 2)? How realistic are these assumptions and how do violations impact the effectiveness of the algorithm?

4. The upper bound proof on the acceptance length relies on the fact that joint probability is upper bounded by the minimum marginal probability. Provide some intuition why this property holds and how it is leveraged in the proof.  

5. Compare and contrast the acceptance length formulas for token-level (Eq 4) and block-level (Eq 3) verification. Provide some insight into why the block-level acceptance length is greater in general. Construct a simple example to demonstrate this gap.

6. Walk through the key steps of the proof of correctness for the block verification algorithm (Lemma 2). In particular, explain how the induction hypothesis is used to argue the distribution matching. 

7. The experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in block efficiency and wall clock speedup across tasks and datasets. Analyze these results - does the extent of improvement depend on specific properties of the task/dataset? Why or why not?

8. The empirical evaluation relies on the PALM model as both target and draft models. How would the effectiveness of block verification change if other model architectures were used instead?

9. The paper claims the proposed block verification algorithm is optimal in terms of maximizing acceptance length. What assumptions need to hold for this optimality result? When might these assumptions be violated in practice?

10. Beyond improving acceptance length, what other metrics could the draft verification phase optimize for? For example, could semantic coherence of the decoded tokens also be incorporated? How might the formulation and algorithm change?
