# [A New Path: Scaling Vision-and-Language Navigation with Synthetic   Instructions and Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03112)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: Can large-scale augmentation with high-quality synthetic instructions enable simpler imitation learning agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN)?

The key points are:

1) VLN agents struggle with complex language grounding and spatial language understanding due to the scarcity of human annotated training data and limited diversity in training environments. 

2) Pretraining on large web image-text datasets has been explored but improvements are limited, likely because these datasets lack the action-oriented and spatially grounded language needed for VLN.

3) This paper investigates using a large-scale synthetic VLN dataset for augmentation. They use the high-quality Marky instruction generator to create 4.2M instruction-trajectory pairs across 500+ environments.

4) They train a simple transformer agent with imitation learning on this augmented dataset. Without any human annotations, this approach outperforms prior RL-based agents on the RxR benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of augmentation with near-human quality synthetic instructions.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that large-scale augmentation with high-quality synthetic instructions can enable simpler imitation learning agents to achieve new state-of-the-art results on challenging VLN tasks, despite the lack of diverse human annotated data. The experiments confirm this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agent that achieves state-of-the-art performance by training on a large dataset of synthetic instructions. Specifically:

- They generate a dataset of over 4 million synthetic navigation instructions using the Marky instruction generator, situated in over 500 photorealistic indoor environments. This is two orders of magnitude larger than existing human-annotated VLN datasets.

- To efficiently learn from this scale of data, they train a simple transformer-based agent using imitation learning (behavioral cloning and DAgger). This contrasts with prior work that uses reinforcement learning.

- On the RxR benchmark their agent outperforms all prior RL-based approaches, improving state-of-the-art success rate from 71.1% to 79.1% in seen environments, and from 64.6% to 66.8% in unseen environments.

- Their results demonstrate that large-scale augmentation with high-quality synthetic instructions enables simpler models to achieve strong performance, pointing to a new direction for VLN research emphasizing synthesis over model complexity.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that large-scale augmentation with synthetic instructions can push the limits of VLN agents trained with imitation learning to surpass more complex models trained on human demonstrations alone. This suggests future progress may come from better synthetic instruction generators rather than more complex neural architectures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes scaling up vision-and-language navigation agents by pretraining on a massive dataset of 4.2M high-quality, near-human synthetic instructions in 500+ photorealistic indoor environments, and shows this allows a simple imitation learning model to surpass more complex state-of-the-art RL agents on the challenging RxR benchmark.
