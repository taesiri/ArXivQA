# [Improving Factuality of Abstractive Summarization via Contrastive Reward   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04507)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research questions that this paper aims to address are:

Q1: Can contrastive reward learning effectively utilize existing factuality metrics to improve the factuality of abstractive summarization models? 

Q2: Can the improvement in factuality be reflected in human evaluation studies?

The key hypothesis is that contrastive reward learning can enable abstractive summarization models to learn from feedback of factuality metrics and generate more factual summaries, as evaluated by both automatic metrics and human judgments. The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to test this hypothesis.

In summary, the core research questions focus on whether contrastive reward learning can help improve the factuality of abstractive summarization models based on feedback from automatic factuality metrics, and whether this improvement can be validated through human evaluations. The central hypothesis is that the proposed learning framework can achieve more factual summarization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple but effective contrastive learning framework that incorporates recent developments in reward learning and factuality metrics to improve the factuality of abstractive summarization models. Specifically, the paper proposes using the scores/rewards from factuality metrics like BARTScore and DAE as rewards in a contrastive reward learning framework to train abstractive summarization models to generate more factual summaries. Through empirical studies on CNNDM and XSUM datasets, the paper shows that the proposed approach enables models to learn from feedback of factuality metrics and generate more factual summaries without sacrificing coherence or relevance. The results suggest that advances in learning algorithms like contrastive reward learning and evaluation metrics like factuality metrics can directly feed into improving the factuality of abstractive summarization models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework that improves the factuality of abstractive text summarization by using factuality metrics like BARTScore and DAE to provide reward signals during training. The main finding is that incorporating feedback from these metrics via contrastive reward learning enables models to generate more factual summaries without sacrificing coherence or relevance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other related work on improving factuality of abstractive summarization:

- The paper presents a simple but effective contrastive learning framework to improve factuality of summarization. This is similar in spirit to other contrastive learning methods like CLIFF and CO2Sum, but is more straightforward without complex constructions of negative samples.

- The paper focuses on utilizing automatic factuality metrics like BARTScore and DAE to provide rewards for contrastive learning. This aligns with recent work on reward learning for summarization using automatic metrics. However, other work has also used human preferences as rewards.

- The paper shows through both automatic metrics and human evaluation that contrastive learning improves factuality without sacrificing relevance or coherence. Other methods have also conducted human studies to demonstrate factuality improvements.

- The paper incorporates recent advances in metrics like BARTScore and DAE. Other work has leveraged different factuality metrics, especially QA-based metrics which can be expensive for reward learning.

- The paper studies reward learning on both extractive (CNNDM) and abstractive (XSUM) summarization datasets. Some other work has focused only on a single dataset type. Evaluating on both helps demonstrate generalization.

- The simplicity of the approach allows it to be easily adapted as new factuality metrics emerge. Other more complex approaches like generating negative samples may not improve further as the base models improve.

In summary, this paper aligns with and builds upon recent work at the intersection of reward learning and factuality of summarization. The simplicity of the approach, use of automatic metrics as rewards, and evaluations demonstrating factuality improvements are notable contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Comparing the capability of RL-based reward learning and contrastive reward learning in improving the factuality of abstractive summarization models. The authors only explored contrastive reward learning in this work.

- Including more non-news datasets in the experiments beyond CNNDM and XSUM. The authors suggest testing on more diverse datasets. 

- Evaluating on a wider range of factuality metrics beyond just BARTScore and DAE. The framework could likely work with other metrics too.

- Testing different methods for negative sample construction in the contrastive learning framework. The authors used a simple approach here.

- Exploring different model architectures and pre-training objectives. The authors just used BART and PEGASUS, but other models could be tested.

- Conducting more comprehensive human evaluations on additional datasets to further verify the improvements in factuality.

- Investigating how to better balance tradeoffs between factuality, coherence, and relevance in the generated summaries.

- Studying how to effectively leverage the framework in high-stakes real-world applications. Further testing is needed before deployment.

In summary, the key suggestions are to explore the framework on more datasets, metrics, models, and applications, compare to other learning paradigms like RL, and conduct expanded human evaluations. The overall goal is to further improve factuality while maintaining coherence, relevance, and applicability to real summarization tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to improve the factuality of abstractive text summarization models. The key idea is to use existing factuality metrics like BARTScore and DAE to provide rewards and train the model via contrastive reward learning. Specifically, given a source document, candidate summaries are first generated using diverse beam search. These candidates are then ranked based on the rewards from the factuality metrics, with higher ranked candidates considered more factual. The contrastive loss aims to align the model's likelihood estimates with this factuality-based ranking. Experiments on CNNDM and XSUM datasets demonstrate that models trained this way can generate more factual summaries without sacrificing coherence or relevance, as reflected in both automatic evaluations and human judgments. The results suggest that advances in factuality metrics and reward learning algorithms can directly improve summarization faithfulness. Overall, the paper introduces a simple yet effective approach to making abstractive summarization more factual.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to improve the factuality of abstractive text summarization models. The key idea is to incorporate recent advancements in reward learning and factuality metrics to provide feedback to the summarization model during training. Specifically, the paper utilizes contrastive reward learning (CRL) to enable models to learn from rewards provided by two factuality metrics - BARTScore and DAE. 

The proposed framework does not require complex negative sample construction. Instead, it relies on candidate summaries generated from pretrained models using diverse beam search. The combined loss function incorporates the maximum likelihood estimation loss to match reference summaries, and a contrastive loss that uses the factuality metrics to provide fine-grained rankings of the candidate summaries. Experiments on the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets demonstrate that contrastive learning from factuality rewards helps generate more factual and coherent summaries compared to learning from ROUGE, as evaluated by both automatic metrics and human judges. The paper provides an effective method to leverage recent advances in factuality metrics to improve summarization faithfulness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to improve the factuality of abstractive summarization models. It utilizes recent advancements in reward learning and factuality metrics. Specifically, the framework incorporates contrastive reward learning, where the rewards come from two factuality metrics - BARTScore and DAE. Candidate summaries are generated from pretrained models using diverse beam search. The contrastive loss penalizes discoordination between the model's estimated log-probability of a summary and the factuality metric scores. This enables the model to learn from the feedback of the factuality metrics. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed framework allows summarization models to generate more factual summaries, without sacrificing coherence or relevance, by leveraging existing factuality metrics through contrastive reward learning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problems and questions that the paper is addressing are:

1. Modern abstractive summarization models often generate summaries that contain hallucinated or contradictory information i.e. lack factuality. The paper aims to address the problem of improving the factuality of abstractive summarization models.

2. The paper investigates whether contrastive reward learning can effectively utilize existing factuality metrics to improve the factuality of abstractive summarization models (Q1). 

3. The paper examines whether the improvement in factuality from using factuality metrics as rewards can be reflected in human evaluation studies (Q2).

In summary, the main focus of the paper is on improving the factuality of abstractive text summarization by using contrastive reward learning to leverage feedback from factuality metrics. The key research questions revolve around whether contrastive reward learning can effectively improve factuality based on automatic metrics, and whether these improvements translate to more factual summaries as evaluated by humans.
