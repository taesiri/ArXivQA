# [Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02229)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- High-dimensional optimization problems have been considered very challenging for standard Bayesian optimization (BO) methods due to the "curse of dimensionality". Many algorithms have been proposed that make structural assumptions (like low effective dimensionality, additivity, locality, etc) to restrict the complexity and enable optimization. 

- This paper hypothesizes that the limitations of standard BO in high dims are solely due to the high complexity assumed a priori about the objective function. Standard BO methods assume very low lengthscales a priori which makes even moderately high dimensional problems impossible to model globally.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a simple plug-and-play enhancement to standard BO - scale the lengthscale prior with the square root of dimensionality. This reduces the assumed complexity and enables effective modeling and optimization even in thousands of dimensions.

- They also fix the signal variance hyperparameter instead of learning it, to prevent possible degeneracies from active data acquisition.

Key Contributions:

- Demonstrate the crucial interplay between dimensionality and complexity in BO, clarifying common failure modes
- Prove analytically that EI acquisition does not actually query high variance points on the boundary for an uninformed model, contrasting common belief
- Propose minor tweaks to vanilla BO that enable it to clearly outperform state-of-the-art HD BO methods on several real-world high dimensional tasks
- Show that standard BO works much better than previously thought in high dimensions, without needing restrictive assumptions on the objective function

In summary, this paper makes both theoretical contributions related to properties of BO in high dimensions as well as shows empircally that simple changes to lengthscale priors can enable effective high dimensional optimization using standard BO.
