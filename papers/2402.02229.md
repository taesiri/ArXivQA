# [Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02229)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- High-dimensional optimization problems have been considered very challenging for standard Bayesian optimization (BO) methods due to the "curse of dimensionality". Many algorithms have been proposed that make structural assumptions (like low effective dimensionality, additivity, locality, etc) to restrict the complexity and enable optimization. 

- This paper hypothesizes that the limitations of standard BO in high dims are solely due to the high complexity assumed a priori about the objective function. Standard BO methods assume very low lengthscales a priori which makes even moderately high dimensional problems impossible to model globally.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a simple plug-and-play enhancement to standard BO - scale the lengthscale prior with the square root of dimensionality. This reduces the assumed complexity and enables effective modeling and optimization even in thousands of dimensions.

- They also fix the signal variance hyperparameter instead of learning it, to prevent possible degeneracies from active data acquisition.

Key Contributions:

- Demonstrate the crucial interplay between dimensionality and complexity in BO, clarifying common failure modes
- Prove analytically that EI acquisition does not actually query high variance points on the boundary for an uninformed model, contrasting common belief
- Propose minor tweaks to vanilla BO that enable it to clearly outperform state-of-the-art HD BO methods on several real-world high dimensional tasks
- Show that standard BO works much better than previously thought in high dimensions, without needing restrictive assumptions on the objective function

In summary, this paper makes both theoretical contributions related to properties of BO in high dimensions as well as shows empircally that simple changes to lengthscale priors can enable effective high dimensional optimization using standard BO.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper shows that standard Bayesian optimization works much better for high-dimensional problems than previously thought by making a simple modification to scale the Gaussian process lengthscale prior with problem dimensionality to reduce model complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Demonstrating the crucial difference between dimensionality and complexity in Bayesian optimization, and highlighting the failure modes related to high assumed complexity. The paper relates existing high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) classes to a reduction in complexity.

2. Proving that when the model is uninformed, the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function will not exhibit exploratory behavior along the boundary, contrasting claims of previous work. 

3. Proposing an enhancement to the prior assumptions typical to vanilla Bayesian optimization algorithms, which reduces the complexity to manageable levels without imposing structural restrictions on the objective. This simple scaling of the Gaussian process lengthscale prior with dimensionality reveals that standard Bayesian optimization works much better than previously thought in high dimensions, clearly outperforming existing state-of-the-art HDBO algorithms on multiple real-world high-dimensional tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is showing that with a simple modification to the lengthscale prior, vanilla Bayesian optimization can work very effectively in high dimensions, outperforming specialized HDBO methods, despite not making simplifying assumptions about the objective function. This highlights the importance of appropriately managing complexity in Bayesian optimization.

The paper discusses challenges with using vanilla Bayesian optimization in high dimensions, relating it to assumptions about the complexity of the objective function. It proposes modifications to the lengthscale priors in the GP kernel to reduce assumed complexity and enable effective optimization in problems with thousands of dimensions. Key results show vanilla BO outperforming state-of-the-art HDBO methods with these modifications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes scaling the lengthscale prior with the square root of the dimensionality. What is the intuition behind using the square root specifically? How sensitive are the results to using a slightly different scaling factor?

2) The paper argues that high dimensionality itself is not the issue that hinders Bayesian optimization, but rather the high complexity that is assumed. Could you expand more on why the conventional lengthscale priors result in too high complexity assumptions in high dimensions? 

3) How does the proposed method of scaling the lengthscales compare to other common approaches for managing complexity, like inducing point methods? What are the tradeoffs?

4) The maximal information gain (MIG) is used throughout as a measure of model complexity. What are some limitations of using the MIG to quantify complexity? Are there alternative metrics that could be used instead?

5) Proposition 1 provides an interesting lower bound on the optimal correlation for expected improvement. What is the intuition behind why this lower bound exists? And what does it imply about the behavior of EI?

6) In the experiments, what method of optimizing the acquisition function was used? Could more advanced methods like multi-fidelity optimization provide additional benefits?

7) For the real-world experiments, what was the runtime comparison between the proposed vanilla BO method and other baselines like SAASBO? Is computational efficiency a benefit?

8) The paper focuses on expected improvement as the acquisition function. How do you think the results would change for other popular acquisitions like UCB or probability of improvement?

9) The method seems very simple but works very well. Do you have any ideas for enhancements or modifications that could improve performance further?

10) The paper argues that assumptions of high complexity are the issue in high dimensions. Do you think there are cases where making structural assumptions could still be beneficial compared to the proposed approach?
