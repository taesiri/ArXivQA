# [DMAT: A Dynamic Mask-Aware Transformer for Human De-occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of human de-occlusion, which aims to recover the appearance of occluded parts of humans in images. This is challenging due to the large variation in human pose, clothing, etc. Existing CNN-based methods have limitations in modeling global context due to small receptive fields. Transformer-based image inpainting methods tend to generate recovered content that resembles the background instead of the human subject. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Dynamic Mask-Aware Transformer (DMAT) to address these issues. The key components are:

1) Expanded Convolution Head (ECH): Uses enlarged convolution kernels to capture more local visible context for each token, mitigating impact of surrounding occlusions.

2) Dynamic Human-Mask Guided Attention (DHMGA): Guides attention to focus more on visible human regions and less on occluded regions/background. Combines human modal mask, invisible mask and occlusion mask.

3) Region Upsampling Decoder (RUD): Upsamples human and background regions separately to protect recovered human content.

4) Amodal Loss: Confines recovery to just the human region during training for better convergence.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first transformer-based architecture for human de-occlusion task
- Designs specialized modules - ECH, DHMGA and RUD to handle challenges specific to this task
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on AHP dataset, with significant margins over prior arts
- Provides detailed analysis and ablation studies demonstrating the efficacy of individual components

The main novelty lies in the specialized attention mechanism and decoding strategy tailored for human de-occlusion. The work demonstrates the promise of transformer-based models for this task.
