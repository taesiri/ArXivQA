# [SeMLaPS: Real-time Semantic Mapping with Latent Prior Networks and   Quasi-Planar Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16585)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to achieve real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences that matches the quality of offline 3D network-based methods, while retaining the advantages of online 2D-3D network-based approaches. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. A 2D network with latent feature re-projection from prior views (LPN) can produce higher quality 2D semantic labels compared to standard per-frame processing.

2. A lightweight online 3D segmentation method (QPOS) tailored for semantic mapping can enable better 3D label refinement compared to prior supervoxel methods. 

3. A segment-convolutional network (SegConvNet) can effectively propagate semantic information between neighboring segments to further improve 3D semantic map quality.

By combining these ideas, the paper hypothesizes it is possible to achieve real-time semantic mapping quality on par with offline 3D networks, while retaining the benefits of online 2D-3D network-based systems like cross-sensor generalization. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel method for real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences. The key ideas are:

1. A Latent Prior Network (LPN) that leverages information from prior views to improve 2D semantic segmentation of the current frame via differentiable feature re-projection. This eliminates redundant per-frame processing and leads to better 2D segmentation.

2. A Quasi-Planar Over-Segmentation method that groups map elements likely to belong to the same semantic classes based on surface normals. This provides a better over-segmentation compared to prior methods. 

3. A lightweight Segment-Convolutional Network for refining semantic labels in 3D that operates on the over-segmented map.

4. The combined system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among real-time 2D-3D network based semantic mapping techniques, matches the performance of offline 3D networks, and shows good cross-sensor generalization.

In summary, the main contribution is a complete real-time semantic mapping pipeline that effectively incorporates multi-view information in both 2D and 3D stages to improve semantic segmentation accuracy to the level of offline 3D networks, while retaining the flexibility and efficiency of 2D-3D approaches. The proposed techniques help overcome some limitations of prior real-time systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a real-time semantic mapping system called SeMLaPS that combines a 2D neural network with latent prior feature re-projection and a lightweight 3D network to incrementally segment RGB-D frames into a semantically labeled 3D map, achieving state-of-the-art performance among 2D-3D network systems while matching 3D CNN accuracy and showing good cross-sensor generalization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences. Here are the key ways it compares to other related work:

- Compared to other 2D-3D network based methods like SVConv and FP-Conv, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor semantic mapping benchmarks like ScanNet. The proposed Latent Prior Network and segment-convolutional post-processing allow it to match or exceed the performance of pure 3D network based methods like MinkowskiNet.

- Compared to prior feature reprojection methods like DA-RNN and MVCNet, the proposed Latent Prior Network reprojects early features using differentiable rendering rather than late features/predictions. This is shown to improve image segmentation accuracy by leveraging multi-view consistency more effectively.

- For 3D map processing, the proposed quasi-planar oversegmentation method is incremental and faster than supervoxel methods like in SVConv, while also being more accurate according to both under-segmentation and over-segmentation metrics.

- Compared to offline 3D networks, the system runs online and incrementally, enabling real-time performance. It also produces 2D semantic labels unlike pure 3D networks.

- Compared to other online 3D networks like INS-Conv, it shows much better cross-sensor generalization ability when evaluated on a RealSense dataset after training only on Kinect-scanned data. This could be advantageous for practical RGB-D SLAM systems.

In summary, the paper pushes state-of-the-art for online semantic mapping using 2D-3D networks, while matching the performance of 3D networks and demonstrating practical advantages like real-time performance and cross-sensor generalization ability. The novel components for multi-view feature fusion and map processing appear to be key contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring better view selection and temporal fusion strategies for the Latent Prior Network (LPN). The authors note LPN can fail in cases of heavy occlusion or extreme motion, and improving the view selection and fusion could help address this limitation.

- Adopting learned methods for feature re-projection and fusion in the LPN, instead of just average pooling. The authors suggest more powerful learned fusion strategies could be beneficial.

- Improving the quality of segment boundaries from the quasi-planar oversegmentation (QPOS). The authors note the segments can still get fragmented boundaries after post-processing. Further improving the smoothness of segment boundaries could help.

- Enhancing the geometric encoding in the Segment Convolutional Network (SegConvNet). The ablation studies show the importance of the geometric features, so finding ways to incorporate more descriptive geometric features could be useful.

- Applying the system to robotic navigation and augmented reality tasks. The authors suggest the availability of real-time semantics could enable many applications in robotics and AR/VR.

- Collecting more diverse multi-sensor datasets. The authors highlight the benefits of their approach for cross-sensor generalization, so more varied datasets could further demonstrate this capability.

- Combining semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation in one system. The authors note their system currently focuses on semantic segmentation, but extending it to instance or panoptic segmentation could be an impactful direction.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving the different components of the system - the 2D network, 3D oversegmentation, and 3D post-processing network - as well as applying the system to downstream applications and diverse sensors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new real-time semantic mapping system called SeMLaPS that combines a 2D neural network with a 3D network built on top of a SLAM system with 3D occupancy mapping. The system takes in RGB-D video frames and produces a semantically labeled 3D map of the environment. It has three main components: 1) A Latent Prior Network (LPN) processes the RGB-D frames using a lightweight 2D CNN enhanced with differentiable latent feature re-projection from prior frames to encode temporal information. 2) A Quasi-Planar Over-Segmentation (QPOS) method divides the 3D map surface voxels into segments using surface normals. 3) A Segment-Convolutional Network (SegConvNet) applies convolutions at the segment level to further refine the 3D semantic map. This achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among 2D-3D network systems and matches 3D CNN performance while working in real-time. The system also shows good cross-sensor generalization ability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper presents a new method for real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences. The proposed system combines a 2D neural network with a 3D network and runs on top of a SLAM system performing camera tracking and 3D geometry reconstruction. 

The first component is a Latent Prior Network (LPN) which processes the RGB-D frames. It uses a lightweight backbone and incorporates latent feature re-projection from previous frames based on differentiable rendering. This allows encoding of prior view information to improve segmentation quality. The resulting 2D labels are lifted to 3D and fused temporarily. Next, a novel Quasi-Planar Over-Segmentation divides the map into segments using surface normals. Finally, a Segment-Convolutional Network refines the 3D semantics by applying convolutions at the segment level. Experiments show state-of-the-art accuracy for real-time 2D-3D network systems, matching 3D network performance on some datasets. The method also shows good cross-sensor generalization capabilities.

In summary, the key innovations are 1) the Latent Prior Network design using differentiable feature re-projection to improve 2D semantics, 2) the Quasi-Planar Over-Segmentation method for grouping map elements, and 3) the Segment-Convolutional Network for efficient 3D post-processing. The system achieves excellent accuracy and generalization within real-time 2D-3D networks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences. The main stages of the method are:

1) A Latent Prior Network (LPN) processes incoming RGB-D frames using a lightweight 2D CNN backbone. It incorporates prior knowledge from previous frames via differentiable feature re-projection and fusion. This results in higher quality 2D semantic segmentation compared to processing frames independently.

2) The 3D map is incrementally over-segmented into quasi-planar segments using surface normals and a graph-based method. Segments group voxels likely to have the same semantics.  

3) A Segment-Convolutional Network refines the semantic labels per segment by applying convolutions tailored for the varying sized segments. It uses the probabilistic semantic predictions from the LPN and geometric features as input.

4) The refined per-segment semantics are propagated back to the voxels.

The method runs online and in real-time on top of a SLAM system, achieving state-of-the-art semantic mapping quality compared to other 2D-3D network approaches and matches 3D network performance. It also shows good cross-sensor generalization capabilities.
