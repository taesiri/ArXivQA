# [Kick Back &amp; Relax: Learning to Reconstruct the World by Watching SlowTV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10713)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) model that is capable of generalizing to complex environments beyond the automotive domain?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Existing SS-MDE methods have only been trained on automotive datasets like KITTI and thus fail to generalize to other environments like indoor or natural scenes. 2) By training on a more diverse and larger-scale dataset of slow TV videos (SlowTV), we can develop an SS-MDE model with much better generalization ability.3) Additional techniques like aspect ratio augmentation, camera intrinsic learning, support frame randomization, and flexible motion estimation will further improve the model's generalization capability.4) This improved SS-MDE model will be able to close the performance gap with supervised state-of-the-art depth estimation methods, despite using only self-supervision.In summary, the main research question is how to develop an SS-MDE model that can generalize well beyond just cars/roads by using more diverse training data and better training techniques. The key hypothesis is that this will enable SS-MDE to reach parity with supervised methods that require ground truth depth for training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introduction of a new large-scale SlowTV dataset for self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE). This dataset contains 1.7M images from 40 videos showing diverse environments like hiking trails, driving routes, and underwater scenes. 2. Using this SlowTV dataset combined with other datasets like KITTI and Mannequin Challenge, they train SS-MDE models that achieve much better generalization to different datasets compared to prior work. Their model outperforms previous self-supervised methods and approaches the performance of recent supervised state-of-the-art models.3. Proposing several best practices to improve SS-MDE performance and generalization:- Aspect ratio augmentation to make the model robust to different image sizes/shapes- Learning camera intrinsics jointly with depth and pose- Randomizing support frames instead of fixed previous/next frames- Removing forward motion constraint for more flexible motion estimation4. Demonstrating the applicability of their self-supervised model to a real-world task of map-free relocalization, where it competes with supervised methods.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the novel SlowTV dataset combined with several training improvements that enable their self-supervised monocular depth estimation model to generalize much better and approach the performance of supervised methods. The key impact is showing the potential of self-supervised methods with diverse training data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a large-scale SlowTV dataset of YouTube videos to train a self-supervised monocular depth estimation model that generalizes well to complex indoor and outdoor environments unseen during training and approaches the performance of supervised state-of-the-art methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading, here is how this paper compares to other research in the field of monocular depth estimation:- The main contribution is the introduction of a new large-scale training dataset (SlowTV) for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Most prior self-supervised methods rely on automotive datasets like KITTI, while this provides more diversity with natural hiking, driving, and underwater videos. The scale is also much larger with 1.7 million frames compared to tens or hundreds of thousands in other datasets. This allows training models with better generalization.- The method leverages the SlowTV dataset along with Mannequin Challenge and KITTI to train a model that generalizes well to other datasets. This is a contrast to many supervised approaches that train specialized models for indoors vs outdoors. The evaluation covers a wide range of indoor, outdoor, natural, and urban datasets to demonstrate zero-shot cross-dataset generalization.- The model incorporates several components to improve training and generalization like learning camera intrinsics, aspect ratio augmentation, and flexible motion estimation. ablation studies demonstrate these provide noticeable gains.- The results show the method bridges the gap between self-supervised and supervised performance. It outperforms prior self-supervised methods by a large margin across metrics and datasets. It is competitive and sometimes better than recent supervised state-of-the-art like MiDaS, DPT and NeWCRFs, despite using a more efficient backbone.- The paper focuses on monocular self-supervision, in contrast to other works that use stereo supervision or proxy labels for training. The results suggest the field is reaching the point where large amounts of unlabeled monocular video alone are enough to train highly accurate and generalizable depth estimation models.In summary, the key novelty is the dataset and demonstration of how it can be used to train models that generalize robustly. The method also incorporates techniques to further improve generalization and achieves results on par with supervised methods, advancing the state-of-the-art in self-supervised monocular depth estimation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring alternative sources of data to incorporate even more scene variety, especially additional indoor data to reduce the remaining performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods on indoor scenes.- Improving the accuracy in dynamic scenes, for example by using optical flow to refine the estimated correspondences in a self-supervised manner, without requiring semantic segmentation or motion masks. However, this would introduce additional computational costs.- Developing models capable of predicting metric depth, rather than only relative depth, to further increase applicability to real-world tasks.- As the diversity of training environments and benchmarks increases, developing more standardized evaluations and criteria for comparing different self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods.- Incorporating additional augmentations during training to make the models more robust to rare poses or orientations, like the extreme rotations that the current models struggle with on the TUM dataset.- Exploring different training objectives and losses beyond the standard reconstruction and smoothness terms to better handle challenging cases like reflective, transparent, or textureless surfaces.- Leveraging temporal information across multiple frames even more effectively, for example through cost volumes or recurrent networks.- Applying the self-supervised training framework to related tasks beyond depth estimation like optical flow, visual odometry, 3D reconstruction.In summary, the main future directions relate to increasing the diversity and scale of training data, improving robustness to challenging cases, predicting metric depth, and extending the self-supervised training approach to related tasks.
