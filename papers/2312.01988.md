# [Geranos: a Novel Tilted-Rotors Aerial Robot for the Transportation of   Poles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01988)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Geranos, a novel octacopter UAV uniquely designed to enable accurate aerial transportation and assembly of vertical poles. Its ring structure allows it to fly over and securely grab poles at their center of mass using an innovative two-part gripping mechanism. This lightweight mechanism demonstrates remarkable rigidity, keeping position and attitude errors below 5mm and 1Â° even when accelerating over 12m/s^2. Four main rotors counterbalance gravity while four auxiliary tilted rotors enable precision maneuvering without tilting the platform. Geranos leverages this advanced design to achieve sub-5cm placement accuracy when transporting 2m-long, 3kg poles. In a demonstration, it autonomously grasps, transports, and stacks two 3kg, 1m poles, showcasing its potential to perform construction tasks like installing antennas without needing human intervention. Preliminary tests also indicate visual servoing can enable Geranos to robustly grasp poles using only its onboard sensors, further increasing its autonomy. Overall, Geranos sets a new aerial robotic standard for precise pole transportation and assembly.
