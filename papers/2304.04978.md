# [StageInteractor: Query-based Object Detector with Cross-stage   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04978)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: How can cross-stage interaction between decoder layers improve the performance of query-based object detectors?Specifically, the paper proposes and investigates two forms of cross-stage interaction:1. Cross-stage label assignment, which gathers assigned labels across decoder stages and re-assigns proper training targets to each prediction. This is aimed at alleviating inconsistency between the strict one-to-one bipartite matching and the modeling capacity.2. Cross-stage dynamic filter reuse, which reuses dynamic operators (e.g. filters) across decoder stages to efficiently increase modeling capacity. The central hypothesis seems to be that leveraging these interactions between decoder stages will allow query-based detectors to achieve better discrimination, modeling capacity and performance compared to prior work. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed StageInteractor architecture with these cross-stage interactions can advance the state-of-the-art for this class of detectors.
