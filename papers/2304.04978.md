# [StageInteractor: Query-based Object Detector with Cross-stage   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04978)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: 

How can cross-stage interaction between decoder layers improve the performance of query-based object detectors?

Specifically, the paper proposes and investigates two forms of cross-stage interaction:

1. Cross-stage label assignment, which gathers assigned labels across decoder stages and re-assigns proper training targets to each prediction. This is aimed at alleviating inconsistency between the strict one-to-one bipartite matching and the modeling capacity.

2. Cross-stage dynamic filter reuse, which reuses dynamic operators (e.g. filters) across decoder stages to efficiently increase modeling capacity. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that leveraging these interactions between decoder stages will allow query-based detectors to achieve better discrimination, modeling capacity and performance compared to prior work. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed StageInteractor architecture with these cross-stage interactions can advance the state-of-the-art for this class of detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new query-based object detector called StageInteractor with two key components:

1. Cross-stage label assignment: Gathers assigned labels across decoder stages and re-assigns proper training labels to each prediction based on score and index constraint. This aims to provide more consistent supervision across stages. 

2. Cross-stage dynamic filter reuse: Reuses heavy dynamic operators (e.g. filters for dynamic convolutions) from previous stages in subsequent stages to increase model capacity efficiently. Lightweight adapters are used to update the reused operators.

The main contributions are:

- Proposing the cross-stage label assignment to provide more consistent supervision for training. This helps alleviate issues with standard bipartite matching.

- Introducing cross-stage dynamic filter reuse to improve model capacity efficiently by reusing operators across stages.

- Achieving new state-of-the-art results among query-based detectors on COCO. The model gets 44.8 AP with ResNet-50 backbone and 100 queries. With longer training and more queries, it achieves 51.1 AP with ResNeXt-101-DCN backbone.

- Showing the proposed cross-stage label assignment can also improve other query-based detectors like Deformable DETR and DINO-DETR.

In summary, the key novelty is the cross-stage interaction through label assignment and operator reuse to improve query-based object detection. The contributions are the specific techniques proposed and the strong results demonstrated.
