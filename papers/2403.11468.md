# [Collage Prompting: Budget-Friendly Visual Recognition with GPT-4V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Evaluating GPT-4V's visual capabilities on large image recognition benchmarks incurs substantial costs, as each individual inference made by the model is expensive. Hence, there is a need for a more cost-efficient way of leveraging GPT-4V for visual recognition tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "Collage Prompting" - concatenating multiple images into a single visual prompt that allows GPT-4V to perform recognition on several images simultaneously in one inference run. This significantly reduces costs compared to standard single-image prompting. 

Additionally, a method called "Learning to Collage Prompt (LCP)" is introduced to optimize the arrangement of images within the collage prompt. Since different arrangements lead to large variance in accuracy, a graph convolutional network "collage predictor" is trained to predict accuracy of arrangements. Then LCP, based on genetic algorithms, searches for the best arrangement over multiple iterations.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduces collage prompting as a budget-friendly approach for GPT-4V's visual recognition, by collaging multiple images into a single prompt for simultaneously processing at much lower costs.

2) Provides analysis and metrics like Cost-Effective Ratio and Precision-Cost Efficiency to demonstrate collage prompting's superior cost-efficiency over standard prompting and CNN/ViT models.

3) Proposes a method to optimize collage arrangements using a learned predictor and genetic algorithm search, enhancing accuracy substantially over random arrangements.

4) Shares evaluation datasets of collage prompts from ImageNet-1K and their accuracy in GPT-4V recognition, to facilitate further research into efficient prompting.

In summary, the paper offers collage prompting as a practical and cost-effective solution to employ GPT-4V for image recognition tasks under budget constraints, while optimization of arrangements further boosts accuracy.
