# [ROS package search for robot software development: a knowledge   graph-based approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Searching for suitable ROS packages from the vast number of available packages is challenging using current search methods that rely on keywords and approximate text matching. These methods have low accuracy due to the mismatch between search keywords and actual package functionalities.  

Proposed Solution:
- A novel semantic-based search approach using a ROS Package Knowledge Graph (RPKG) for accurate retrieval of the most suitable ROS packages. 

- Multi-dimensional feature extraction techniques employed to extract key semantic concepts from package text descriptions, including category, function, characteristics, hardware device etc. This results in 32,294 entities and 54,698 relationships in the RPKG.

- A robot domain specific corpus built to fine-tune BERT (BERT-ROS) to generate effective embeddings representing semantics of extracted features. This facilitates semantic comparisons during search.

- A weighted similarity matching search algorithm designed that computes similarities between user search query and ROS packages on multiple features to find the most relevant packages.

Main Contributions:

- Established a high-level abstraction view of ROS packages discussing main concepts and relationships. 

- Proposed multi-dimensional feature extraction technique and constructed the RPKG with rich semantics to represent ROS packages across dimensions.

- Designed a novel semantic matching-based search algorithm incorporating weighted similarities of multiple features from user queries.

- Evaluation showed the approach enhances ROS package search accuracy, outperforming ROS Index, GitHub, Google and ChatGPT by at least 21% over various top search result levels.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive semantic-based approach for accurate search of suitable ROS packages by extracting multidimensional features into a knowledge graph and designing an effective graph search algorithm. Experiments validate the higher relevance of search results.
