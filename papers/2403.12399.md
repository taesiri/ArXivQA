# [Electioneering the Network: Dynamic Multi-Step Adversarial Attacks for   Community Canvassing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores the problem of online social network manipulation for community canvassing, motivated by how election campaigns and debates happen over online platforms nowadays. The authors model community canvassing as a dynamic process over a network, enabled via adversarial attacks on graph neural networks (GNNs). Prior attacks on GNNs are single-step and don't account for the cascading nature of information diffusion. The authors consider an adversary using a GNN to predict and manipulate voter preferences of uncertain voters. Gradient attacks inform strategic manipulations to proselytize voters. Specifically, they introduce the problem of minimum budget attacks for community canvassing (MBACC).

Proposed Solution:
The authors first show MBACC is NP-Hard. They then propose Dynamic Multi-Step Adversarial Community Canvassing (MAC) to address it. MAC makes dynamic decisions based on: (1) low budget perturbations, and (2) high second-order influence to maximize impact. At each step, MAC uses a single-step attack to convert the most vulnerable target voter into an attacker. It chooses targets needing minimum budget to convert and having highest influence over remaining targets. It perturbs the network to convert targets and then makes additional influential perturbations to maximize impact. MAC runs iteratively, with newly converted nodes further converting targets, stopping when the desired number of target voters convert.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate novel problem of Minimum Budget Adversarial Community Canvassing (MBACC), at intersection of adversarial ML, network science and political science. 
- Show NP-Hardness of MBACC.
- Propose MAC, an efficient dynamic multi-step attack algorithm that discovers low-budget and high-influence targets for cascading attacks.
- Evaluate MAC against single-step baselines on MBACC over multiple networks and GNNs. Experiments show superiority of MAC in discovering efficient multi-hop attacks for adversarial canvassing.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in surfacing vulnerabilities of online social networks to manipulation during elections, via a dynamic multi-step adversarial attack guided by a proxy GNN.
