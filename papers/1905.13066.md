# Align-and-Attend Network for Globally and Locally Coherent Video   Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be:How can we design an efficient deep learning model for video inpainting that can fill in missing regions in a video with both spatially and temporally coherent contents?The key aspects that the paper tries to address are:- Using a larger temporal window to find relevant information from distant frames to fill in target holes, as compared to prior flow-based approaches with limited search range. - A coarse-to-fine framework with an initial global alignment stage using homographies, followed by a refinement stage using non-local attention to compensate for details not captured by global alignment.- Incorporating a recurrence stream to propagate information from previous frames and ensure temporal consistency. Overall, the main contribution seems to be a novel deep network architecture for video inpainting that combines these ideas to achieve improved spatial-temporal coherence over prior arts, while remaining efficient compared to optimization-based techniques. The experiments aim to demonstrate these advantages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel deep learning based network for fast video inpainting. The key ideas are:- Using homography to align reference frames to the target frame. This allows expanding the temporal window to use more distant frames as references. - A two-stage coarse-to-fine approach. The first stage aligns and aggregates visible contents from references to coarsely fill the target holes. The second stage refines the coarse result using non-local attention. - Recurrent propagation of previous outputs to enforce temporal consistency.- The proposed network runs much faster than previous optimization-based methods while achieving comparable or better results.In summary, the paper proposes an efficient deep network for video inpainting that utilizes a large spatio-temporal window via homography and achieves high-quality coherent video results. The main advantage is the fast runtime compared to previous optimization-based techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for video inpainting that uses homography to align reference frames to the target frame in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the model to fill in missing regions with globally and locally coherent contents by capturing long-range correlations between the target hole and distant information.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this video inpainting paper compares to other works in the field:- Compared to traditional video inpainting methods based on patch optimization, this paper presents a deep learning approach that is much faster and can synthesize more complex backgrounds and textures. The traditional methods are quite slow due to dense patch search, while this method runs in near real-time.- The two main recent deep learning papers for video inpainting are CombCN and VINet. Compared to CombCN, this paper handles higher resolution videos and more complex hole shapes, beyond just fixed square regions. Compared to VINet, a key difference is the use of homography for alignment rather than optical flow. This allows aggregating information from more distant frames. - A core contribution seems to be the proposed two-stage coarse-to-fine network design. The homography-based alignment provides a good initial fill, then the non-local attention refines it by matching generated patches to reference patches. This provides both global and local coherence.- The output propagation via a recurrence stream is also an important component for ensuring temporal consistency, which is lacking in image inpainting networks applied per-frame.- Quantitative experiments show this method performs comparably or better than recent state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality and temporal smoothness. The user study also indicates it is preferred over other methods.- The approach is demonstrated on real videos from DAVIS dataset and challenging object removal scenarios. So it seems applicable to practical use cases.In summary, the paper presents innovations over prior arts like the two-stage fill approach and achieves strong results. The comparisons validate it pushes state-of-the-art for deep video inpainting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring more sophisticated alignment modules beyond homography estimation to handle more complex motions and scene dynamics. The authors mention that homography can only model global transformations like affine and perspective warps. Developing alignment modules that can account for non-rigid motions could further improve results.- Investigating different attention mechanisms in the refinement stage. The non-local attention used in this work could potentially be replaced by other attention designs to improve modeling of long-range dependencies. - Adding an adversarial training scheme. The authors note they did not use adversarial losses in this work. Adding GAN training could help further enhance the realism of inpainted videos.- Applying the approach to higher resolution videos. The experiments in this work were conducted on low resolution 256x256 videos. Testing the method on higher resolution videos is an important direction.- Evaluating on a more diverse set of video datasets. The experiments primarily used the DAVIS dataset. Testing generalization to other diverse video datasets could better reveal the strengths/weaknesses.- Exploring self-supervised training schemes instead of the synthetic data used currently. Self-supervision from real videos could improve results.- Investigating end-to-end joint training of all components rather than stage-wise training used in this work. End-to-end training could help optimize all parts together.
