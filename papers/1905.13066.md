# [Align-and-Attend Network for Globally and Locally Coherent Video   Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be:

How can we design an efficient deep learning model for video inpainting that can fill in missing regions in a video with both spatially and temporally coherent contents?

The key aspects that the paper tries to address are:

- Using a larger temporal window to find relevant information from distant frames to fill in target holes, as compared to prior flow-based approaches with limited search range. 

- A coarse-to-fine framework with an initial global alignment stage using homographies, followed by a refinement stage using non-local attention to compensate for details not captured by global alignment.

- Incorporating a recurrence stream to propagate information from previous frames and ensure temporal consistency. 

Overall, the main contribution seems to be a novel deep network architecture for video inpainting that combines these ideas to achieve improved spatial-temporal coherence over prior arts, while remaining efficient compared to optimization-based techniques. The experiments aim to demonstrate these advantages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel deep learning based network for fast video inpainting. The key ideas are:

- Using homography to align reference frames to the target frame. This allows expanding the temporal window to use more distant frames as references. 

- A two-stage coarse-to-fine approach. The first stage aligns and aggregates visible contents from references to coarsely fill the target holes. The second stage refines the coarse result using non-local attention. 

- Recurrent propagation of previous outputs to enforce temporal consistency.

- The proposed network runs much faster than previous optimization-based methods while achieving comparable or better results.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient deep network for video inpainting that utilizes a large spatio-temporal window via homography and achieves high-quality coherent video results. The main advantage is the fast runtime compared to previous optimization-based techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for video inpainting that uses homography to align reference frames to the target frame in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the model to fill in missing regions with globally and locally coherent contents by capturing long-range correlations between the target hole and distant information.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this video inpainting paper compares to other works in the field:

- Compared to traditional video inpainting methods based on patch optimization, this paper presents a deep learning approach that is much faster and can synthesize more complex backgrounds and textures. The traditional methods are quite slow due to dense patch search, while this method runs in near real-time.

- The two main recent deep learning papers for video inpainting are CombCN and VINet. Compared to CombCN, this paper handles higher resolution videos and more complex hole shapes, beyond just fixed square regions. Compared to VINet, a key difference is the use of homography for alignment rather than optical flow. This allows aggregating information from more distant frames. 

- A core contribution seems to be the proposed two-stage coarse-to-fine network design. The homography-based alignment provides a good initial fill, then the non-local attention refines it by matching generated patches to reference patches. This provides both global and local coherence.

- The output propagation via a recurrence stream is also an important component for ensuring temporal consistency, which is lacking in image inpainting networks applied per-frame.

- Quantitative experiments show this method performs comparably or better than recent state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality and temporal smoothness. The user study also indicates it is preferred over other methods.

- The approach is demonstrated on real videos from DAVIS dataset and challenging object removal scenarios. So it seems applicable to practical use cases.

In summary, the paper presents innovations over prior arts like the two-stage fill approach and achieves strong results. The comparisons validate it pushes state-of-the-art for deep video inpainting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more sophisticated alignment modules beyond homography estimation to handle more complex motions and scene dynamics. The authors mention that homography can only model global transformations like affine and perspective warps. Developing alignment modules that can account for non-rigid motions could further improve results.

- Investigating different attention mechanisms in the refinement stage. The non-local attention used in this work could potentially be replaced by other attention designs to improve modeling of long-range dependencies. 

- Adding an adversarial training scheme. The authors note they did not use adversarial losses in this work. Adding GAN training could help further enhance the realism of inpainted videos.

- Applying the approach to higher resolution videos. The experiments in this work were conducted on low resolution 256x256 videos. Testing the method on higher resolution videos is an important direction.

- Evaluating on a more diverse set of video datasets. The experiments primarily used the DAVIS dataset. Testing generalization to other diverse video datasets could better reveal the strengths/weaknesses.

- Exploring self-supervised training schemes instead of the synthetic data used currently. Self-supervision from real videos could improve results.

- Investigating end-to-end joint training of all components rather than stage-wise training used in this work. End-to-end training could help optimize all parts together.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning based network for video inpainting. The key idea is to fill in missing regions of a target frame by fetching visible contents from multiple reference frames. The method consists of two main stages - an alignment stage using homographies to warp reference frames onto the target frame, providing a coarse prediction, followed by a refinement stage using non-local attention to pick relevant patches from aligned references to compensate for complex motions. The alignment via homographies allows aggregating information from more distant frames compared to prior flow-based approaches. The refinement stage matches generated hole regions to non-hole areas to recover details. The network also uses a recurrence stream to propagate previous predictions for temporal consistency. Experiments demonstrate the approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods and is competitive with optimization methods while being much faster. The large spatial-temporal windows in the two-stage pipeline enable modeling long-range correlations for higher quality and more coherent video inpainting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning based network for video inpainting. The key idea is to fill in missing regions (holes) in a target video frame by referring to multiple other frames from the video using a coarse-to-fine approach. First, they use a homography estimation network to align reference frames to the target frame. This provides a larger search area compared to prior optical flow based approaches. The aligned frames are then aggregated based on content similarity to generate an initial coarse prediction for the missing regions. Next, a non-local attention module matches patches in this coarse estimate to valid patches in the reference frames. This refines the estimate by capturing finer motions not modeled by the alignment. They also have a residual convolutional pathway to hallucinate novel content not visible in any frame. Finally, they use a recurrence stream with optical flow warping to enforce temporal consistency with past frames.

Experiments on object removal from videos demonstrate the approach is effective. The two-stage coarse-to-fine aggregation using homography alignment and non-local refinement enables modeling long range correlations to fill challenging holes. Comparisons to prior deep models and optimization methods show improved quality and temporal consistency while being much faster. Ablations validate the contributions of the different components. Overall, this method achieves strong video inpainting results in an efficient feed-forward network by effectively leveraging spatial-temporal information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel deep learning based video inpainting method. The key ideas are:

1) Use homography to align multiple reference frames to the target frame. This allows using a larger temporal window compared to optical flow based methods. 

2) A two-stage coarse-to-fine network architecture: 

- Alignment stage: Compute homographies to warp reference frames to target frame and aggregate features.

- Refinement stage: Use non-local attention to match generated patches with reference patches to refine details.

3) Recurrent propagation stream to encourage temporal consistency by propagating previous frame's output using estimated optical flow.

4) Train homography estimation network on synthetic data. Train video inpainting network on YouTube-VOS dataset and fine-tune on DAVIS.

5) Evaluate on DAVIS for video object removal. Show better performance than prior learning based methods and comparable results to optimization based techniques while being much faster.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of homography for coarse alignment and non-local attention for refinement to effectively leverage information from multiple frames in a large temporal window. The recurrent stream improves temporal consistency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of video inpainting, which aims to fill in missing or corrupted regions in a video with plausible contents in a coherent manner across space and time. The key challenges are:

- Filling in missing regions with spatially coherent and realistic contents. The generated pixels need to be consistent with the surrounding image context.

- Maintaining temporal coherence. The filled content needs to be consistent across frames as objects and scenes change over time. 

- Efficiency and practicality. Previous optimization-based video inpainting methods are slow and do not scale well. Deep learning based methods need to be fast and effective.

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel deep learning based video inpainting approach to address these challenges. The key ideas include:

- Using homography estimation to align reference frames to the target frame to enable fetching valid content from distant frames. This expands the temporal range compared to prior optical flow based approaches. 

- A two-stage coarse-to-fine network architecture. The first stage performs alignment and coarse inpainting, while the second refines the results using non-local matching.

- Adding a temporal consistency module using recurrence with optical flow warping. 

- A training scheme involving synthetic data and real videos.

Overall, the paper presents a fast and effective deep video inpainting method that leverages both spatial and temporal information in a coarse-to-fine manner. The results demonstrate improved performance over prior deep learning and optimization based techniques.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for video inpainting. The method takes a target video with spatial-temporal holes and fills in the missing regions using information from a set of reference frames sampled from the video. The approach consists of two main stages - an alignment module and a refinement module. The alignment module uses computed homographies to globally align the reference frames to the target frame and Roughly fill in the holes. The refinement module then uses a non-local attention mechanism to match and copy patches from non-hole areas in the references to refine the hole regions. By using homography alignment, the method can aggregate information from a much larger temporal window compared to flow-based approaches. The refinement stage models local motions and details that cannot be captured by global alignment. Experiments on object removal from videos demonstrate the method generates coherent completions spatially and temporally. The two-stage coarse-to-fine approach allows handling of challenging holes and dynamic scenes.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for video inpainting, which aims to fill in missing or occluded regions in a video with realistic and temporally coherent content. The method consists of two main stages. First, an alignment module uses computed homographies to globally align visible content from multiple reference frames onto the target frame to be inpainted. This provides a large temporal search window compared to prior flow-based approaches. The aligned patches are aggregated based on frame similarity to roughly fill the target holes. Second, a non-local attention module matches and refines the coarsely generated patches using pixel-wise correspondences between reference and target patches. Both stages use large spatio-temporal windows to enable modeling long-range correlations and filling challenging scenes with large/slowly moving holes. The network also incorporates a recurrence stream to encourage temporal consistency across frames. Experiments demonstrate the approach inpaints coherent video content on par with optimization-based methods but much faster. Ablations validate the design choices. The method represents an advance in deep video inpainting through its ability to leverage global alignment and non-local attention to fill complex hole regions.
