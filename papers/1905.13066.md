# Align-and-Attend Network for Globally and Locally Coherent Video   Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be:How can we design an efficient deep learning model for video inpainting that can fill in missing regions in a video with both spatially and temporally coherent contents?The key aspects that the paper tries to address are:- Using a larger temporal window to find relevant information from distant frames to fill in target holes, as compared to prior flow-based approaches with limited search range. - A coarse-to-fine framework with an initial global alignment stage using homographies, followed by a refinement stage using non-local attention to compensate for details not captured by global alignment.- Incorporating a recurrence stream to propagate information from previous frames and ensure temporal consistency. Overall, the main contribution seems to be a novel deep network architecture for video inpainting that combines these ideas to achieve improved spatial-temporal coherence over prior arts, while remaining efficient compared to optimization-based techniques. The experiments aim to demonstrate these advantages.
