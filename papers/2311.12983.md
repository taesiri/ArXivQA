# [GAIA: a benchmark for General AI Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces GAIA, a new benchmark for evaluating general AI assistants. GAIA consists of 466 carefully crafted real-world questions that require assistants to exhibit skills like reasoning, handling multi-modality, web browsing, and tool use proficiency. The questions are designed to be conceptually simple for humans (who score 92% accuracy) yet challenging for advanced AI systems. The authors show that while the latest LLMs like GPT-4 get only 15% accuracy when equipped with plugins, there is still a lot of potential in augmenting LLMs as evidenced by some success cases. GAIA questions have unambiguous factual answers that allow automated scoring, avoid gameability issues facing other benchmarks, and provide interpretability. The methodology behind crafting good GAIA questions is discussed to aid extending the benchmark. Overall, GAIA attempts to measure progress towards more general intelligence rather than narrow professional skills. Solving GAIA is viewed as an important milestone, with performance disparity compared to humans indicating ample room for advancement.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces GAIA, a new benchmark for evaluating general AI assistants. GAIA consists of 466 carefully crafted questions that require abilities like reasoning, handling multiple data types, using online tools, and web search to answer. The questions are designed to be conceptually simple yet challenging - humans can answer over 90% correctly but advanced AI systems like GPT-4 struggle, with at most 30% accuracy even when equipped with plugins. GAIA departs from the trend of creating AI benchmarks that are extremely difficult, arguing instead that robust performance on everyday tasks indicates progress towards artificial general intelligence. The paper details GAIA's composition and guidelines for extending it, analyzes current system capabilities, and discusses limitations and future directions around dynamic benchmarks and unified evaluation. Overall, GAIA aims to provide a convenient yet difficult benchmark tracking progress towards AI assistants that exhibit broadly capable, human-like competence.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces GAIA, a new benchmark for evaluating general AI assistants on real-world, multi-step reasoning tasks, which shows a large gap between human performance (92%) and current LLMs (15% for GPT-4), indicating it as a next milestone towards more capable AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing GAIA, a new benchmark for evaluating general AI assistants. Specifically:

- GAIA proposes 466 real-world questions that require abilities like reasoning, multi-modality handling, web browsing, and tool use proficiency. The questions are conceptually simple for humans (92% accuracy) but challenging for current AI systems.

- The paper discusses the rationale, design principles, and composition of the GAIA benchmark. This includes guidelines for creating new questions and extending the benchmark over time.

- An analysis is provided of how current LLMs like GPT-4 perform on GAIA. Even when equipped with tools/plugins, GPT-4 scores only 15%, highlighting the potential for progress.

- GAIA questions have unambiguous answers, allowing simple automatic evaluation. This helps address problems like gameability and data contamination in many existing benchmarks.

- The authors release a subset of GAIA questions as a public benchmark, with the rest held privately to power an online leaderboard for measuring progress.

So in summary, the key contribution is the new GAIA benchmark itself, which aims to robustly measure progress towards more capable AI assistants.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new benchmark called GAIA for evaluating general AI assistants. Here are some key ways it compares to other research:

- It focuses on real-world, challenging questions that require abilities like reasoning, multimodal understanding, web browsing etc. This is different from many existing benchmarks that use more narrow, synthetic tasks.

- It emphasizes unambiguous questions with clear ground truth answers to allow robust automatic evaluation. Many benchmarks rely more on human evaluation or model-based evaluation which can be costly and introduce subtle biases. 

- It aims to avoid pitfalls like memorization and data contamination through question diversity and requiring complex, multi-step completions. Some benchmarks have suffered from models exploiting shortcuts instead of solving tasks properly.

- It provides guidelines for extending the benchmark with additional questions. Many benchmarks are static or don't provide a clear methodology for growth over time.

- The benchmark questions are designed to be conceptually simple for humans, with near perfect accuracy, while still challenging for advanced AI systems. This contrasts the trend toward benchmarks on tasks increasingly difficult even for experts.

So in summary, this benchmark distinguishes itself through its real-world grounding, focus on fundamental abilities, built-in robustness, and aim of charting progress en route to more advanced AI assistants. It offers a complementary approach to much existing research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions, including:

1. Adding human and model-based evaluation of the reasoning traces behind the answers in GAIA, to better validate the thought process. 

2. Extending GAIA with more questions over time, replacing broken ones, to keep it relevant and prevent memorization. This could help assess generalization and robustness.

3. Using GAIA's methodology to evaluate complex generative AI systems beyond just text, like image generators. For example asking questions about modifications made to images that can only be answered if the modifications were correctly applied.

4. Exploring how to evaluate AI assistants on performing real actions beyond just information queries, while avoiding spam - for example actually booking meetings or uploading files. The authors leave this for future work.

5. Adding multilingual questions and non-English evidence sources to evaluate assistants for non-English speakers. The current benchmark is English-only.

6. Reducing the need for human involvement in crafting unambiguous questions, possibly via synthetic data generation, to scale up the benchmark.

So in summary, future work could focus on extending evaluation to reasoning traces and actions, scaling up the benchmark in size and languages, and reducing reliance on human annotation.
