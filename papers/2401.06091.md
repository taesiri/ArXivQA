# [A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In machine learning, it is commonly believed that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for comparing binary classification models under class imbalance. 
- This paper challenges this widespread notion through novel mathematical analysis and by examining the empirical evidence behind this claim in the literature.

Key Contributions:

1) Establishes a probabilistic relationship between AUROC and AUPRC, showing they differ only in how they weight false positives - AUROC weights them equally while AUPRC weights them by the inverse of the model's likelihood of outputting that score.

2) Demonstrates mathematically and through synthetic experiments that unlike AUPRC, AUROC favors model improvements across all score thresholds in an unbiased manner. In contrast, AUPRC prioritizes fixes to higher score mistakes first, which can introduce biases.

3) Through the synthetic experiments, shows AUPRC optimizations overtly favor higher prevalence subgroups over lower prevalence ones, accentuating disparities. This poses fairness concerns for critical domains like healthcare. 

4) Conducts an extensive automated + manual literature review, analyzing over 1.5 million arXiv papers. Finds the claim regarding AUPRC's superiority is frequently made without substantiation, often based on flawed arguments, incorrect attributions or through misinterpretations. 

In summary, the paper presents strong technical and empirical evidence, combined with a detailed review of the literature landscape, to convincingly challenge prevailing assumptions regarding the merits of AUPRC over AUROC. It cautions against unvalidated practices in ML and calls for more thoughtful metric selection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper challenges the common belief that AUPRC is superior to AUROC for model comparison in binary classification tasks with class imbalance, arguing through mathematical analysis, experiments, and a literature review that this claim is invalid and AUPRC can introduce harmful biases against minority subgroups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A mathematical analysis showing that AUROC and AUPRC can be concisely related in probabilistic terms. Specifically, the paper proves a theorem showing that AUROC weights all false positives equally, whereas AUPRC weighs false positives according to the model's likelihood of outputting a score greater than the given threshold (its "firing rate").

2. An analysis showing that AUROC favors model improvements across all scores in an unbiased manner, whereas AUPRC prioritizes improvements in high-scoring regions first. This means AUPRC implicitly favors high-prevalence subgroups over low-prevalence ones.

3. An extensive automated and manual literature review analyzing over 1.5 million arXiv papers. This revealed widespread misattributions and logically unsound justifications underpinning the common belief that AUPRC is superior to AUROC for model comparison under class imbalance. 

In summary, the main contribution is a mathematical and empirical analysis challenging the notion that AUPRC is superior to AUROC for binary classification tasks with class imbalance, along with an investigation exposing flaws in the discourse perpetuating this belief.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper presents a novel mathematical relationship between AUROC and AUPRC in Theorem 1. Can you explain the key probabilistic insights this theorem provides into how these two metrics differ, especially with respect to the model's firing rate? 

2. In the framework proposed for atomic mistakes, the paper argues AUROC favors improvements evenly while AUPRC prioritizes high-scoring mistakes first. Can you illustrate with an example how this leads AUPRC to introduce biases towards high-prevalence groups?

3. The paper claims AUPRC's dependence on prevalence can make it dangerous in contexts like healthcare. Can you expand on this concern and discuss what kinds of biases it could introduce when evaluating model performance across diverse patient subgroups?  

4. One of the optimization procedures involves permuting scores constrained within a small window. Can you explain the motivation for this particular approach and why it was chosen over simply adding random noise?

5. The synthetic experiments demonstrate AUPRC optimizations can worsen disparities between subgroups. Can you suggest an additional experiment that could provide further evidence to substantiate this alarming finding?  

6. In the literature review, the paper finds many citation errors and logical fallacies. Can you analyze one such invalid justification argument seen in the papers and critique its logical soundness?  

7. The paper argues the PR curve's utility doesn't extend to claims on AUPRC's generic superiority over AUROC. Can you expand on why this argument does not necessarily hold? 

8. One insight from valid literature is AUPRC's dependence on prevalence. How does the paper build on this existing finding with its theoretical analysis?

9. The paper shows reliance on overall AUPRC risks disadvantaging low-prevalence groups. Suggest an alternative evaluation approach to mitigate this concern.  

10. The paper exposes deficiencies in discourse practices in ML today. What lessons does this study offer regarding diligent scientific inquiry and ethical ML research?
