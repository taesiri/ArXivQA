# [I-SplitEE: Image classification in Split Computing DNNs with Early Exits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying large deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to their computational demands.  
- Strategies like split computing (partial offloading to cloud) and early exits (exit at intermediate layers) help mitigate this, but have limitations.
- Choosing the optimal "splitting layer" is difficult when test data distribution changes from training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a unified approach combining split computing and early exits. 
- Introduce "splitting layer" - the final layer computed on edge device before offloading.
- Attach an exit at the splitting layer to enable early exit if prediction confidence is high.
- If confidence is low, offload to cloud for further processing.
- Develop an online learning algorithm called I-SplitEE to dynamically determine optimal splitting layer based on confidence scores, computational costs and offloading costs.
- Leverages multi-armed bandit framework to balance between accuracy and costs.

Main Contributions:
- Unified framework merging split computing and early exits for efficient edge-cloud co-inference.
- I-SplitEE algorithm to adaptively select splitting layer in an online, unsupervised manner based on context.
- Optimizes resource usage across edge and cloud by minimizing performance degradation and costs.
- Experiments on distorted image datasets show I-SplitEE reduces costs by >55% with under 5% drop in accuracy over final layer exit baseline.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative strategy to deploy DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices by intelligently splitting computation between the edge and cloud. The online learning algorithm can dynamically determine the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency based on real-time data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an innovative approach called I-SplitEE that combines early exits and split computing in DNNs to enable adaptive selection of the optimal splitting layer for efficient edge-cloud co-inference while balancing accuracy, computational costs, and communication costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an innovative unified approach that merges early exits and split computing for efficient deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices. Specifically:

1) The paper integrates split computing and early exiting to enable early inferences for "easy" samples on edge devices, while offloading "difficult" samples to the cloud for further processing. 

2) The paper develops an online learning algorithm called I-SplitEE to dynamically select the optimal splitting layer in the DNN based on context in an online and unsupervised manner. This allows adapting to changes in the distribution of test data.

3) The I-SplitEE algorithm optimizes resource utilization across both the edge device and the cloud by balancing accuracy, computational costs on the edge device, and communication costs for offloading. 

4) Experimental validation shows that I-SplitEE minimizes performance degradation (drop in accuracy <=5%) while significantly reducing costs (drop in cost >55%) compared to processing all samples at the DNN's final layer.

In summary, the main contribution is an innovative unified split computing and early exiting approach with an online learning algorithm that efficiently balances accuracy and costs by optimally utilizing resources on both the edge device and cloud.
