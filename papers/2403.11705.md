# [Coarsening of chiral domains in itinerant electron magnets: A machine   learning force field approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Frustrated itinerant magnets often exhibit complex noncollinear or noncoplanar magnetic orders like skyrmions or tetrahedral spin textures. These support topological electronic structures like the anomalous quantum Hall state. 

- A canonical example is the chiral tetrahedral spin order on a triangular lattice stabilized by electron-spin interactions. This breaks a discrete Ising (Z2) symmetry leading to a chiral order that persists at finite temperatures. 

- However, simulating the phase ordering dynamics and chiral domain coarsening in such itinerant magnets is difficult due to the computational complexity of computing local exchange fields from the electronic structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a scalable machine learning framework to model the complex electron-mediated spin interactions in itinerant magnets. 

- They employ a Behler-Parrinello scheme used in machine learning force-field methods for molecular dynamics. The total spin energy is decomposed into local energies that depend only on local spin neighborhoods.

- These local energies are represented by neural networks. Using automatic differentiation, this allows efficient computation of local exchange fields. Crucially, this is transferable due to locality and scalable as the same network is reused.

- The method preserves spin rotation and lattice symmetries. Group theory is used to develop rotationally invariant features of local spin configurations as input to the networks.

Contributions:  
- The machine learning model is benchmarked to accurately reproduce exchange fields and spin dynamics from exact solutions.

- It enables large-scale simulations of chiral domain formation and coarsening in the triangular Kondo lattice after thermal quenching. 

- In contrast to expected Allen-Cahn growth, chiral domains exhibit anomalous linear temporal growth due to domain wall anisotropy from electron-mediated interactions.

- The work demonstrates the promise of machine learning models combined with spin dynamics simulations to investigate complex magnetic orders in itinerant electron systems.
