# [Supporting Anticipatory Governance using LLMs: Evaluating and Aligning   Large Language Models with the News Media to Anticipate the Negative Impacts   of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Anticipating the negative impacts and unintended consequences of emerging AI technologies is challenging, yet important for responsible innovation. Expert perspectives used in current approaches have limitations due to biases. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for expanding the range of impacts considered, but need further evaluation. 

Solution:
The paper develops a taxonomy of AI impacts from analyzing negative impacts mentioned in a diverse news media corpus. This taxonomy covering 10 categories of impacts acts as a baseline for evaluating different LLMs on generating coherent, relevant and plausible impacts. Specifically, the quality and distribution of impacts from instruction-based models like GPT-4 and fine-tuned models like Mistral-7B are assessed.

Key Contributions:

(1) A taxonomy of 10 categories of AI impacts (e.g. social, economic) identified from computational analysis of negative impacts mentioned across 266 online news domains.

(2) Evaluation highlighting biases of LLMs in anticipating impacts. Instruction-based models missed certain impact categories covered in the taxonomy, while fine-tuned models reflected taxonomy categories more comprehensively.  

(3) Demonstration that smaller, open-source fine-tuned models can generate quality impacts comparable to much larger proprietary models, suggesting viability for democratizing anticipatory practices.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a methodology for developing an adaptive taxonomy of AI impacts from news media, using it to benchmark LLM performance on impact anticipation, showing promise but also gaps. Overall, it contributes to research on aligning LLMs with societal perspectives on impacts for supporting responsible AI innovation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops and evaluates the use of large language models for anticipating the negative impacts of AI technologies by aligning them with a taxonomy of impacts derived from diverse news media sources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a taxonomy of AI impacts identified from analyzing news media coverage. This taxonomy provides a broad, normative baseline for evaluating AI impacts reflected in society.

2. It evaluates and compares several language models - including GPT-4, Mistral-7B-Instruct, GPT-3, and Mistral-7B - in their capability to anticipate negative impacts of AI systems. The results highlight gaps in some instruction-based models in capturing certain categories of impacts compared to fine-tuned models.

3. It shows that smaller, open-source models like Mistral-7B, when fine-tuned on diverse impacts from news media, can generate impacts across categories comparable to much larger models like GPT-4. This demonstrates the potential to democratize anticipatory AI ethics tools.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) an AI impact taxonomy from news media, (2) an evaluation of LLMs for anticipating impacts, showing gaps for instruction-based models, and (3) evidence that smaller open-source LLMs, when aligned to news media impacts, can effectively support anticipation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper develops a taxonomy of AI impacts from news media coverage. What are some potential biases or limitations in using news media as the sole data source for developing such a taxonomy? How might the taxonomy differ if developed from other data sources?

2. The paper uses computational methods like clustering and topic modeling to analyze the impacts extracted from news articles. How might the clustering configurations or topic modeling parameters have influenced the categories of impacts identified? What analysis could be done to evaluate the robustness of the taxonomy?  

3. The taxonomy has 10 categories of AI impacts. At what level of granularity were impacts grouped into these categories? Could drilling down to sub-categories within each reveal different insights about media portrayals of AI risks and harms?

4. The paper finds social and ethical impacts are most prevalent in the news coverage, followed by economic, privacy and other categories. Does this align with or diverge from expert-generated taxonomies of AI impacts? What might account for any differences observed?

5. The paper uses the taxonomy as a baseline to compare impacts generated by different LLMs. What other baselines could complement or strengthen this evaluation approach? How might the findings differ with other baselines?  

6. The paper finds gaps in some impact categories produced by instruction models compared to fine-tuned models. What hypotheses could be tested about why certain categories were missed more frequently? How might prompt engineering improve coverage?

7. Qualitative analysis finds impacts from smaller, open-source LLMs can reach parity with much larger models. What quantitative metrics could also be used to evaluate and compare model performance on this task?

8. The method relies on extracting functional descriptions of AI systems from news articles to pair with impact descriptions. What are some limitations of this synthesized data for fine-tuning compared to real-world examples?  

9. The paper demonstrates potential uses for fine-tuned models in supporting anticipatory governance of AI. What challenges or ethical considerations should be accounted for when developing applied anticipatory tools? 

10. What steps could a researcher take to make the fine-tuning process for an open-source LLM easily reproducible? What documentation or artifacts would be needed to enable reproducibility?
