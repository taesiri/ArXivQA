# [Five-fingered Hand with Wide Range of Thumb Using Combination of   Machined Springs and Variable Stiffness Joints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing robot hands either lack dexterity to manipulate objects, or lack strength to support heavy loads. 
- Human hands can dexterously manipulate objects in-hand as well as exert large gripping forces to support body weight. 
- Developing robotic hands that have both dexterity and high strength has been a challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors developed a robotic hand that combines strength from machined metal springs with dexterity from a wide range-of-motion thumb joint and variable stiffness fingers.

Key Contributions:
- Thumb joint uses 3 springs allowing wide 120Â° opposition range to match human thumbs.
- Fingers use machined metal springs to provide strength and also variable stiffness for dexterity.  
- Developed hand can perform dexterous manipulation like switching car lever, turning a door knob.
- Hand can also exert large 400N gripping force to support heavy loads.
- Demonstrated wiping a table - leveraging compliance to successfully grasp towel without breaking hand.

Overall, the paper presents a novel robotic hand design that uniquely combines strength from machined springs and dexterity from biomimetic joints. Key contributions are the wide-range thumb joint, variable stiffness fingers, and demonstrating a good balance of in-hand manipulation dexterity alongside ability to exert large forces for load bearing.
