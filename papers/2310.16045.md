# [Woodpecker: Hallucination Correction for Multimodal Large Language
  Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16045)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the main research question this paper investigates is: How can we mitigate visual hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) without needing to retrain the models? 

The key hypothesis is that a training-free framework named Woodpecker can effectively correct hallucinations in MLLM-generated text by extracting key concepts, formulating visual questions, validating against visual knowledge, generating visual claims, and finally correcting the hallucinations. The paper proposes this is a new paradigm compared to prior work focused on model retraining or data optimization.

In summary, the central research question is how to correct hallucinations in MLLMs without model retraining, with the hypothesis that the proposed Woodpecker framework can achieve this via a pipeline of interpretable steps for hallucination diagnosis and correction.
