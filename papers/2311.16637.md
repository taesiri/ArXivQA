# [Parallax-Tolerant Image Stitching with Epipolar Displacement Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16637)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summarization paragraph for the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image stitching method that utilizes epipolar geometry constraints to achieve robust alignment while preserving shape. First, the concept of plane-induced homography is introduced in the context of epipolar geometry between two views. This allows the establishment of an image warping model based on infinite homography that satisfies epipolar constraints. Next, an epipolar displacement field (EDF) is constructed by extending the idea of local elastic deformation using thin plate splines. The EDF models pixel displacements along corresponding epipolar lines between the warped and original images. By optimizing and interpolating the EDF, accurate alignments can be achieved in overlapping regions without disrupting global geometry. Comparative experiments on images with large parallax demonstrate the proposed techniqueâ€™s effectiveness in eliminating artifacts while maintaining visually pleasing transitions. Both qualitative and quantitative results showcase marked improvements against existing methods. The technique provides an elegant stitching solution that leverages fundamental geometric principles to balance projective correctness and local elasticity. Limitations primarily arise in wide baselines causing severe foreground occlusions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel image stitching method that utilizes epipolar geometry constraints to guide image warping through an epipolar displacement field, achieving accurate alignment while preserving projection consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel parallax-tolerant image stitching approach based on the epipolar displacement field (EDF). Specifically:

1) It establishes a warping technique using infinite homography and epipolar geometry constraints. This aligns the target image to form a concentric projection model with the reference image while ensuring the warped pixels move along associated epipolar lines. 

2) It extends the concept of local elastic deformation to construct an epipolar displacement field formulated using thin-plate splines. This field guides the warping to accurately align overlapping regions while preserving shape in non-overlapping areas.

3) Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, it demonstrates the proposed method's competitiveness in stitching images with large parallax. The method achieves high alignment quality in overlapping regions and preserves global structure better than other methods.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a parallax-tolerant stitching approach that introduces epipolar constraints into the warping process to achieve better alignment quality and shape preservation.
