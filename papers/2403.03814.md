# [Evaluating the Elementary Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language   Models with MultiQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) today are primarily intended for use in English or a small set of high-resource languages, posing a barrier to equal access. 
- However, recent research shows people still prompt LLMs in many languages beyond their intended use. 
- This motivates the need to study the basic multilingual capabilities of current chat-optimized open LLMs.

Proposed Solution 
- The authors introduce MultiQ, a new silver standard benchmark for open-ended question answering across 137 typologically diverse languages, created by translating 200 English questions.
- Using MultiQ, they evaluate the language fidelity (ability to respond in prompted language) and question answering accuracy of 6 popular open LLMs. 
- They also explore the relationship between language fidelity and accuracy, and differences in tokenization strategies as a potential explanatory factor.

Main Contributions
- MultiQ benchmark with 27,400 question prompts in 137 languages for testing basic multilingual QA capabilities 
- Analysis of language fidelity and QA accuracy for 6 open LLMs, revealing:
   - Significant capabilities beyond intended language use
   - Positive link between fidelity and accuracy
   - Large variations across models and languages
- Identification of tokenization as a potential driver of differences in multilinguality

In summary, the paper introduces a new broad multilingual benchmark to test the basic capabilities of today's chat models beyond their intended language scope, revealing interesting yet complex multilingual behaviors that warrant future investigation. Key factors likely include model scale, tokenization strategies, as well as tailoring models to be explicitly multilingual.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MultiQ, a new benchmark for evaluating the basic multilingual capabilities of large language models across 137 languages, and uses it to assess the language fidelity, question answering accuracy, and their relationship for several state-of-the-art chat models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of MultiQ, a new silver standard benchmark for evaluating the basic multilingual capabilities of large language models across 137 languages. Specifically, MultiQ allows assessing two key dimensions - language fidelity (whether models respond in the prompted language) and question answering accuracy. Using MultiQ, the authors evaluate several state-of-the-art open chat models and find that while some models like Llama2 have very low language fidelity, responding predominantly in English, others like Mistral can respond faithfully in many languages. They also find that increased language fidelity positively impacts QA accuracy. In addition, the paper provides an analysis of tokenization strategies as a potential explanation for differences in multilingual capabilities across models. Overall, MultiQ enables a granular assessment of multilingual abilities of chat models beyond their intended language coverage.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Multilingual capabilities 
- Language fidelity - The ability of a model to respond in the prompted language
- Question answering (QA) accuracy 
- Open-ended questions
- Typologically diverse languages 
- Silver standard benchmark
- Automated translation
- Byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenization
- Language families
- Real-world LLM usage

The paper introduces a new benchmark called MultiQ for evaluating the basic multilingual capabilities of LLMs across 137 languages. It analyzes the language fidelity and QA accuracy of several popular open LLMs. The key findings include differences in fidelity across models, higher QA accuracy for English, and correlations between fidelity and accuracy. The paper also explores tokenization strategies as a potential explanation for differences in multilingual performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does MultiQ compare to existing multilingual benchmarks in terms of language coverage and typological diversity? What are some of the unique aspects of MultiQ?

2. The paper uses automated translation and evaluation to create a "silver standard" benchmark. What are some of the potential limitations of this approach compared to a manually curated gold standard dataset? How did the authors try to validate and account for these?

3. What are some of the key differences between language fidelity and QA accuracy as dimensions of multilingual capability? Why is it important to evaluate both independently and in relation to each other? 

4. The GPT-4 classifier is used to automatically evaluate QA accuracy. What metrics were used to validate the classifier against human judgments? What are some of the tradeoffs with this approach?

5. The paper finds that increased language fidelity has a positive correlation with higher QA accuracy. What are some potential explanations for why this effect occurs? How could this relationship be further tested?

6. Tokenization strategies seem to correlate with differences in QA accuracy between models. What specific tokenization differences were identified between Llama2 and Mistral? How was the tokenization analysis conducted?

7. How does the language coverage of MultiQ compare to the intended language use of models like Llama2, Mistral and Mixtral? Why is it still valuable to test models beyond their intended use?

8. What language families and question domains are covered in MultiQ? How was typological diversity quantified using URIEL vectors and Grambank features?

9. The paper identifies Hindi and Indonesian as 'fallback' response languages for certain model-prompt pairs. What could explain this effect? How prevalent is it across models?

10. What opportunities exist for future work to build on the MultiQ benchmark and analysis approach proposed in this paper? What enhancements or additional experiments seem worthwhile?
