# [DeepCDCL: An CDCL-based Neural Network Verification Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural networks used in safety-critical applications like self-driving cars and aircraft control systems can make catastrophic mistakes if not properly verified. However, formally verifying neural networks is very time-consuming, limiting its practical application. Existing verification methods and tools like Planet have limitations in fully utilizing infeasible paths to prune the search space and optimizing the verification process. Therefore, there is a need to develop more efficient neural network verification frameworks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DeepCDCL, a novel conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) based neural network verification framework. The key components are:

1) Solver Module with multiple parallel solver threads, each using a SAT solver and neural network verifier to solve subproblems. 

2) Clause Manager Module to generate, collect and manage conflict clauses using multiple conflict analyzer threads. It maintains a conflict clause pool and unsatisfiable path pool.

3) Implementation of 3 conflict clause generation methods - adding negation of disjunctions, encoding activation state changes, and elastic filtering. Optimizations like input space partitioning, streamlining data structures, and asynchronous conflict clause learning are also proposed.

Main Contributions:

1) Implementation of DeepCDCL integrating state-of-the-art tools with the CDCL framework tailored for neural network verification.

2) Introduction of an asynchronous clause learning structure to reduce redundant time consumption compared to direct CDCL application.

3) Demonstration of specific speedups on ACAS Xu and MNIST datasets, and illustration of DeepCDCL's acceleration in branch cutting using a case study.

The results show DeepCDCL achieves faster verification than Marabou in most test cases, especially for unsatisfiable problems, solving additional benchmark problems and achieving over 100x speedup in some cases.
