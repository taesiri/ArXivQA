# [Auxiliary Tasks Benefit 3D Skeleton-based Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08942)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a new method called AuxFormer for 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction. - The core research question is: can auxiliary tasks help improve the learning of spatial-temporal dependencies and lead to better motion prediction performance?- The hypothesis is that by introducing auxiliary tasks like denoising and masked prediction during training, the model can be forced to learn more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies. This will result in more informative motion features and improved prediction accuracy.- To enable the auxiliary tasks, the paper also proposes an auxiliary-adapted transformer network structure.- Experiments verify that AuxFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly on standard datasets. The results support the hypotheses that auxiliary tasks can promote spatial-temporal dependency learning.In summary, the key research question is whether auxiliary tasks can help boost spatial-temporal dependency modeling and motion prediction performance. The hypothesis is validated through the proposed AuxFormer method and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new auxiliary learning framework with an adaptive transformer network for 3D human motion prediction. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Proposing a new auxiliary learning framework that jointly trains the motion prediction task along with auxiliary denoising and masking prediction tasks. The auxiliary tasks provide additional requirements to force the model to learn more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies.2. Proposing an auxiliary-adapted transformer network that can handle incomplete/corrupted motion data and model coordinate-wise spatial-temporal dependencies to cooperate with the auxiliary learning framework.3. Conducting experiments on multiple motion prediction datasets to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method. It outperforms previous methods by large margins and shows higher robustness under missing data and noise cases. In summary, the main novelty lies in using an auxiliary learning strategy and designing an adaptive transformer network to enable more effective spatial-temporal dependency modeling for human motion prediction. This provides a new direction in addition to previous works that focus on network architecture designs. The experiments verify the advantages of the proposed method.

Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research in the field of 3D human motion prediction:- The paper focuses on enhancing spatial-temporal dependency modeling, which is a core challenge in human motion prediction. It proposes a new direction of using an auxiliary learning framework and auxiliary tasks, as opposed to just designing network structures like most prior work. This provides a new perspective.- The auxiliary tasks introduced, including denoising and masking prediction, are novel in the context of motion prediction. They impose additional requirements that force more comprehensive learning of spatial-temporal dependencies.- The proposed auxiliary-adapted transformer is tailored to handle incomplete/corrupted motion data and enable coordinate-level dependency modeling, unlike generic transformers. The mask-aware attention design is also novel.- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with significant margins compared to prior arts. The evaluations also demonstrate the method's stronger robustness to missing and noisy data.- Overall, this paper makes multiple new contributions regarding the model learning framework, network design, and experiments/analysis. The key novelty lies in enhancing dependency modeling from the model learning perspective via auxiliary tasks, rather than just network architectures.In summary, the paper presents a novel framework and makes contributions orthogonal to most existing work that focus on network architectures. It provides a new direction for human motion prediction research. The introduced concepts could potentially be integrated with other methods to make further advancements in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more advanced network architectures for modeling spatial-temporal dependencies in human motion. The authors propose using an auxiliary learning framework to enhance dependency learning, but note there is still room for improvement in network design.- Exploring different types of auxiliary tasks beyond masking prediction and denoising. The authors show these two tasks are effective, but other auxiliary tasks could provide further benefits. - Applying the auxiliary learning framework to other sequence prediction problems besides human motion, such as gesture recognition, action anticipation, etc. The authors suggest the framework could have broad applicability.- Developing methods to make motion prediction models more robust to noisy and incomplete data. The authors demonstrate their model has improved robustness, but note this is an important direction for real-world application.- Considering multi-modal inputs beyond just motion sequences, such as images, point clouds or interactions with objects/humans. This could make the prediction more accurate and applicable to complex real environments.- Evaluating the framework on a larger variety of long-term motions over longer time horizons. The experiments focus on short and medium term predictions up to 1 second.Overall, the authors propose auxiliary learning as a promising new direction for human motion prediction and suggest enhancements in network architecture, task design, application domains, robustness, multimodality and long-term modeling as interesting avenues for future work.
