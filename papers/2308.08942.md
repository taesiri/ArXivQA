# [Auxiliary Tasks Benefit 3D Skeleton-based Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08942)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a new method called AuxFormer for 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction. - The core research question is: can auxiliary tasks help improve the learning of spatial-temporal dependencies and lead to better motion prediction performance?- The hypothesis is that by introducing auxiliary tasks like denoising and masked prediction during training, the model can be forced to learn more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies. This will result in more informative motion features and improved prediction accuracy.- To enable the auxiliary tasks, the paper also proposes an auxiliary-adapted transformer network structure.- Experiments verify that AuxFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly on standard datasets. The results support the hypotheses that auxiliary tasks can promote spatial-temporal dependency learning.In summary, the key research question is whether auxiliary tasks can help boost spatial-temporal dependency modeling and motion prediction performance. The hypothesis is validated through the proposed AuxFormer method and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new auxiliary learning framework with an adaptive transformer network for 3D human motion prediction. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Proposing a new auxiliary learning framework that jointly trains the motion prediction task along with auxiliary denoising and masking prediction tasks. The auxiliary tasks provide additional requirements to force the model to learn more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies.2. Proposing an auxiliary-adapted transformer network that can handle incomplete/corrupted motion data and model coordinate-wise spatial-temporal dependencies to cooperate with the auxiliary learning framework.3. Conducting experiments on multiple motion prediction datasets to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method. It outperforms previous methods by large margins and shows higher robustness under missing data and noise cases. In summary, the main novelty lies in using an auxiliary learning strategy and designing an adaptive transformer network to enable more effective spatial-temporal dependency modeling for human motion prediction. This provides a new direction in addition to previous works that focus on network architecture designs. The experiments verify the advantages of the proposed method.
