## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced network architectures for modeling spatial-temporal dependencies in human motion. The authors propose using an auxiliary learning framework to enhance dependency learning, but note there is still room for improvement in network design.

- Exploring different types of auxiliary tasks beyond masking prediction and denoising. The authors show these two tasks are effective, but other auxiliary tasks could provide further benefits. 

- Applying the auxiliary learning framework to other sequence prediction problems besides human motion, such as gesture recognition, action anticipation, etc. The authors suggest the framework could have broad applicability.

- Developing methods to make motion prediction models more robust to noisy and incomplete data. The authors demonstrate their model has improved robustness, but note this is an important direction for real-world application.

- Considering multi-modal inputs beyond just motion sequences, such as images, point clouds or interactions with objects/humans. This could make the prediction more accurate and applicable to complex real environments.

- Evaluating the framework on a larger variety of long-term motions over longer time horizons. The experiments focus on short and medium term predictions up to 1 second.

Overall, the authors propose auxiliary learning as a promising new direction for human motion prediction and suggest enhancements in network architecture, task design, application domains, robustness, multimodality and long-term modeling as interesting avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called AuxFormer for 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction. The key idea is to introduce an auxiliary learning framework that jointly trains the motion prediction task along with two auxiliary tasks: a masking prediction task and a denoising task. These auxiliary tasks help the model better capture spatial-temporal dependencies in the motion data by requiring it to predict masked coordinates and denoise corrupted coordinates based on uncorrupted data. To enable handling of incomplete and noisy motion data, the authors propose an auxiliary-adapted transformer network that models coordinate-wise dependencies and is adaptive to missing data. Experiments show the proposed AuxFormer method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on three datasets. The auxiliary learning framework helps the model learn more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies. AuxFormer also demonstrates improved robustness on incomplete and noisy motion data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new auxiliary learning framework and network architecture called AuxFormer for 3D human motion prediction. The key idea is to learn the primary future motion prediction task jointly with two auxiliary tasks - masking prediction and denoising - that require the model to capture spatial-temporal dependencies more comprehensively. 

Specifically, the framework consists of three branches that share a common dependency modeling network called the auxiliary-adapted transformer. This network encodes each coordinate into an individual feature and models coordinate-wise spatial-temporal dependencies using a mask-aware attention mechanism. It is designed to be adaptive to incomplete motion data caused by masking in the auxiliary tasks. The auxiliary masking prediction task randomly masks some input coordinates and predicts the masked values. The auxiliary denoising task adds noise to some coordinates and aims to recover the original values. By forcing the model to rely on spatial-temporal correlations to perform these auxiliary tasks, it learns a more effective representation for motion prediction. Experiments show AuxFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and is more robust to missing and noisy data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a new auxiliary learning framework for 3D human motion prediction. The key idea is to jointly learn the primary future motion prediction task along with two auxiliary tasks: a masking prediction task and a denoising task. 

The masking prediction task randomly masks some joint coordinates in the input motion sequence and tries to predict the masked coordinates from the unmasked ones. The denoising task randomly adds noise to some coordinates and aims to recover the original noise-free coordinates. These two auxiliary tasks require the model to capture spatial-temporal dependencies between joints and timestamps in order to infer the masked or noisy coordinates. 

To implement this framework, the paper proposes an auxiliary-adapted transformer network. It encodes each coordinate into a feature and models pairwise dependencies between coordinates through spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. It also incorporates masking tokens and a mask-aware design to handle incomplete motion data caused by masking. By training the future prediction task together with the two auxiliary recovery tasks using this network, the model is forced to learn more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies, leading to better motion prediction performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in the paper are:

- The paper focuses on the problem of 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction, which aims to forecast future human motions given past observations. Accurately predicting human motion has important applications like human-machine interaction and autonomous driving.

- One of the main challenges in human motion prediction is effectively capturing the spatial-temporal dependencies in the observed motion data, as human motions involve complex interactions between different joints over time. 

- The paper notes that most prior work has focused on designing network architectures to model spatial-temporal dependencies. The key question this paper tries to address is - can we improve dependency modeling from other perspectives beyond network design?

- To address this, the paper proposes a new direction of using an auxiliary learning framework with additional auxiliary tasks to promote better learning of spatial-temporal dependencies, rather than solely focusing on network architecture design.

In summary, the core problem is 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction and the key question is how to better learn spatial-temporal dependencies to improve prediction accuracy, beyond just network architecture design. The paper proposes auxiliary learning tasks as a new direction to achieve this.
