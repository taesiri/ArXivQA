# [Integrated and Lightweight Design of Electro-hydraulic Ankle Prosthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07514)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the design of an integrated, lightweight active ankle-foot prosthesis based on electro-hydraulic actuation. Through analysis of human gait biomechanics and ankle joint kinetics, the requirements for prosthetic ankle angle, torque, and power output are established. An electro-hydraulic system with energy recovery and redistribution capabilities is proposed to address these requirements while minimizing size and maximizing efficiency. Optimized component selection, 3D integration, and topology optimization of the valve body and ankle skeleton are then conducted to enable lightweight design within minimal space. Specifically, B-spline channels, P-type triply periodic minimal surfaces, and topology reconstruction are employed to reduce prosthesis weight by over 50% while retaining mechanical performance. Simulation validates that the optimized integrated design meets the ankle angle, torque, and efficiency targets across the gait cycle, achieving significant power-to-weight ratio improvements for compact and energy-efficient active prostheses. Overall, the paper presents an integrated approach spanning from biomechanics foundations to multifaceted structural optimization to design high-performance yet practical wearable assistive devices.
