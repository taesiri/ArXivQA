# [Explaining Pre-Trained Language Models with Attribution Scores: An   Analysis in Low-Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainability of machine learning models is important, especially when deploying them in real-world applications. Two main challenges are the need to explain model predictions and the need to adapt models to low-resource scenarios.
- Prior work has mostly studied model explanations for fine-tuned models, not for prompt-based models which work well in low-resource settings. 
- It is unclear how plausible and faithful explanations from prompt-based models are, especially compared to fine-tuned models. It is also unclear which explanation method works best to explain prompt-based models.

Methods:
- Extract explanations (attention scores, integrated gradients, Shapley values) from prompt-based models and fine-tuned models trained on sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks.
- Evaluate explanations w.r.t. plausibility (human perspective) and faithfulness (model perspective), considering different training set sizes.
- Compare a large language model (decoder-only) to encoder-based prompt model.
- Use statistical significance testing to analyze differences.

Key Findings:
- Prompt-based models generate more plausible explanations than fine-tuned models in low-resource settings.  
- Shapley Value Sampling consistently outperforms attention and integrated gradients in terms of plausibility and faithfulness.
- Findings transfer from encoder-based prompt models to decoder-based language models.

Main Contributions:
- First analysis and comparison of explanations from prompt-based versus fine-tuned models
- Analysis along different training set sizes 
- Showing the superiority of Shapley Value Sampling for explaining prompt-based models
- Demonstrating that prompting works better than fine-tuning not only for model performance but also for model explainability


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the plausibility and faithfulness of attribution scores extracted from prompt-based models compared to fine-tuned models across different training set sizes, finding that prompt-based models yield more plausible explanations than fine-tuned models in low-resource settings and that Shapley Value Sampling consistently outperforms attention and Integrated Gradients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper shows for the first time that prompt-based models yield more plausible explanations than fine-tuned models in low-resource settings. It also shows that Shapley Value Sampling consistently outperforms attention and Integrated Gradients in terms of both plausibility and faithfulness scores across different models, tasks and training set sizes. Specifically, the main findings are:

(1) Prompt-based models generate more plausible explanations in low-resource settings compared to fine-tuned models. 

(2) Shapley Value Sampling attribution method outperforms other methods like attention and Integrated Gradients across tasks and settings and is similarly faithful as gold standard annotations.

(3) The trends seem to hold not just for encoder-based prompt models but also for decoder-based large language models, indicating the broader relevance of the findings.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis and comparison of explanation methods for prompt-based and fine-tuned models, introducing training size as an additional dimension, with new findings on the higher quality of explanations from prompt-based models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces training size as a new dimension in analyzing attribution scores. Why is this an important contribution compared to prior work? What new insights does this dimension enable?

2. The paper finds that prompt-based models yield more plausible explanations than fine-tuned models in low-resource settings. What are some potential reasons for this? How do the learning dynamics differ between prompting and fine-tuning that could lead to this result?  

3. The paper shows that Shapley value sampling consistently outperforms attention and integrated gradients. Why might the calculation of Shapley values be particularly suitable for contextual models like BERT? What are the limitations of attention and integrated gradients in this context?

4. The paper studies both plausibility and faithfulness of explanations. Why is it important to evaluate both perspectives? What are some of the key tradeoffs between optimizing for one vs. the other?

5. The paper introduces several prompting methods like manual prompting, BitFit, and BFF. How do these methods differ and what are some of their relative strengths and weaknesses when extracting explanations?

6. The paper performs an analysis with large language models. What additional challenges arise when extracting explanations from autoregressive models compared to encoder-based models? How could the findings transfer or not transfer?

7. The paper focuses on discrete prompts due to their interpretability. What are some of the key differences between discrete and continuous prompts when extracting explanations? What are interesting open questions for future work?

8. What types of linguistic phenomena might be particularly challenging for different attribution methods to explain appropriately? How could the analysis be extended to better understand model behavior on specific linguistic constructs?

9. The paper uses average precision for plausibility and a AUC-based metric for faithfulness. What are some limitations of these metrics and how could they be improved or supplemented in future work?

10. What are some particularly interesting open questions that this work motivates for better understanding the connection between prompting, explanation methods, and model architectures? What theories could be developed and tested?
