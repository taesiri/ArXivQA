# [Beyond Predictive Algorithms in Child Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predictive risk models (PRMs) are increasingly used in child welfare to guide decisions, but may rely on biased inputs that focus on deficits without capturing case complexities. 
- Prior qualitative research found issues with PRMs, but little quantitative evaluation of how risk assessments conceptualize and predict outcomes.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors quantitatively evaluate risk assessments and casenotes from a US child welfare agency using machine learning models. 
- They train classifiers on risk assessment scores and narratives to compare predictive validity on discharge outcomes (reunification or not).
- They also apply topic modeling to casenotes to understand signals in narratives.

Key Findings:
- Risk assessment scores show high accuracy overall but very poor ability to predict non-reunification, failing to capture risks.  
- Casenotes provide some weak signals towards outcomes but contain biased perspectives and variable details.
- Aggregated casenote topics reveal nuanced contexts like caseworker actions and family interactions.

Main Contributions:
- Quantitative evidence that risk assessments used in predictive models have poor validity in conceptualizing meaningful risks tied to outcomes.
- Demonstrating limitations of using either existing metrics or narratives to predict outcomes.
- Argument to move away from predictive tasks and rather use contextual data like narratives to study child welfare systems.
- Proposal to apply computational text analysis on aggregated narratives in public sector domains to understand stakeholder experiences.

In summary, the paper critiques predictive algorithms in child welfare through analyzing risk and narrative data, and advocates shifting focus to contextual understanding over prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper quantitatively deconstructs risk assessment scores and child welfare case narratives to critique the validity of using risk assessments to build predictive models in child welfare, finding that while risk assessments cannot predict outcomes, aggregated case narratives can provide contextual insights into the complexities of child welfare cases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors quantitatively deconstruct child welfare risk assessment (RA) scores and find that RA metrics are largely irrelevant in predicting child welfare discharge outcomes. Specifically, machine learning models built using only RA scores showed high false positive rates, suggesting RA scores cannot distinguish between cases that result in reunification and those that do not.

2) Through topic modeling of child welfare caseworker narratives, the authors show that casenotes provide different signals and contextual details compared to RA scores. However, casenotes present biased caseworker perspectives and are not suitable for prediction tasks.

3) The authors critique the use of RA data and casenotes for predictive analytics in child welfare. They argue for moving beyond using such data sources for prediction and instead utilizing contextual data like casenotes to study and understand complex sociotechnical systems in child welfare and the broader public sector.

In summary, the main contribution is providing quantitative and computational evidence to shift away from predictive risk models in child welfare and highlighting opportunities for using contextual data to study public sector systems. The authors adopt multiple analytical lenses to critically examine child welfare algorithms.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Child welfare system
- Predictive risk models (PRMs)
- Risk assessments (RAs) 
- Caseworker casenotes/narratives
- Topic modeling
- Classification models
- Predictive validity 
- Construct validity
- Sociotechnical systems
- Public sector algorithms

The paper examines the predictive validity of risk assessments and caseworker narratives in the child welfare system. It applies topic modeling to casenotes and trains classification models using risk assessment scores and narratives to predict child welfare discharge outcomes. The key findings are that risk assessments have poor predictive validity while caseworker narratives provide useful contextual signals but contain biases. The paper argues for moving beyond predictive analytics in child welfare and using contextual data like narratives to study sociotechnical systems in the public sector.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that risk assessments (RAs) used in child welfare agencies have poor predictive validity for determining reunification outcomes. What further analysis could be done to better understand why RAs have such poor predictive performance? For example, interviewing case workers on how they interpret and apply RA scores in decisions.

2. The topic modeling analysis uncovered 5 high-level themes in the case notes. Do you think these themes fully capture the key information in the notes relevant to reunification decisions? If not, what other themes might emerge from a deeper qualitative analysis? 

3. One limitation raised is that case notes present potentially biased case worker perspectives. How could the method be adapted to include perspectives from other stakeholders (e.g. parents, children) to overcome this limitation?

4. The paper argues against using case notes or RAs for prediction and instead supports using case notes for contextual understanding. Do you agree with this position? Could better prediction models be developed with different data representations?

5. The random forest classifier using topic model probabilities could correctly predict 35.7% of non-reunification cases. Is this performance level useful at all for real-world decisions? Under what conditions might it be helpful?

6. How robust is the topic modeling analysis to variations in preprocessing steps for the case notes (e.g. different stopwords lists, stemming approaches etc.)? Were any sensitivity analyses done?

7. What other classifiers beyond SVM and random forests could have been used? Would neural network approaches capture signals in the case note data more effectively?

8. How was the number of topics selected for the topic model? Was any model selection process used to determine the optimal number of topics?

9. The study uses data from a single child welfare agency. How might the findings generalize or differ across agencies with different processes and populations?

10. The paper argues for using case notes instead of risk assessments to study child welfare systems. Are there any risks or downsides to focusing analysis only on case note data? Could both data sources play complementary roles?
