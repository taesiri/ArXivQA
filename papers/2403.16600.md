# [Research Challenges for Adaptive Architecture: Empowering Occupants of   Multi-Occupancy Buildings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adaptive architecture holds promise to enhance occupant satisfaction and wellbeing by integrating robotic technology to physically adapt spaces to occupants' changing needs. However, challenges remain regarding how to effectively support individuals while mediating between groups and integrating meaningfully into building communities.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a vision for adaptive architecture that aligns the spatial, situational and subjective qualities of an adapted layout to convey an appropriate "sense of place" for acceptance. 
- Capture individual experiences accurately yet ethically via computer vision, digital twins simulations and voluntary user prompting. 
- Mediate collocated impact by identifying when to act autonomously versus allowing user control over layout adaptations.
- Engage building communities by transitioning architect roles to orchestrating dynamic spaces based on continuous post-occupancy feedback.

Main Contributions:
- Outlined research challenges of adaptive architecture across individual, group and community levels in buildings.
- Proposed mitigation approaches grounded in sense of place theory, advanced tracking techniques, autonomy frameworks from human-robot interaction, and organizational culture change.
- Called for new building design, use and management processes that bring together occupants, managers, architects and HCI experts.

In summary, this paper argues that while adaptive architecture shows promise to empower occupants through robotic spatial adaptations, progress requires addressing multi-level social challenges regarding the accuracy, pervasiveness and continuity of capturing experiences, collocated impact mediation, and engagement processes across building communities. The authors contribute a roadmap to guide this emerging research area.
