## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pedestrian intention prediction, especially determining if a pedestrian will cross in front of an autonomous vehicle, is critical for safe driving but remains a challenging task.  
- Lack of diverse and large datasets with crossing/non-crossing examples limits development of accurate models.

Proposed Solutions:
1) A framework called ARCANE to procedurally generate synthetic crossing/non-crossing video datasets in CARLA simulator. Allows advanced programmatic control of scenarios.

2) A synthetic dataset called PedSynth with 947 video clips covering 400 locations, 5 hours of 30FPS video, with ~398K labeled frames. More data than existing real-world datasets.

3) A lightweight deep learning model called PedGNN to predict crossing intentions from sequence of pedestrian skeletons. Based on Graph Neural Network + GRU architecture. 

Main Contributions:
- ARCANE framework to generate customizable synthetic data for crossing/non-crossing task
- Large and diverse PedSynth dataset complementing existing real datasets  
- PedGNN model with state-of-the-art performance but 10x smaller and faster than prior work
- Experiments showing PedSynth can play role of training set, complement real data, and be testing set
- Overall - framework, dataset and model to advance pedestrian intention prediction research

The paper introduces useful synthetic data capabilities and an efficient model to help address the critical challenge of predicting pedestrian crossing intentions for autonomous driving systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new framework called ARCANE for generating synthetic datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. What are the key components and functionalities of this framework? How does it build on top of the CARLA simulator?

2. The paper generates a new dataset called PedSynth using the ARCANE framework. What are some of the key features of this dataset compared to existing real-world datasets like JAAD and PIE? How is the dataset split into train/val/test sets?

3. The paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model called PedGNN for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Explain in detail the architecture and different components of PedGNN. What are its key advantages compared to prior state-of-the-art models? 

4. PedGNN takes sequences of pedestrian skeletons as input. How are these skeletons represented and what information do they encode at each node/joint? What is the rationale behind using a graph-based model for processing such skeletal inputs?

5. What are the different training hyperparameters and protocols used for optimizing PedGNN? How is the final best model selected after training using multiple parameter combinations?

6. What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of PedGNN and other baseline models for the crossing intention prediction task? Why is F1 chosen as one of the key metrics?

7. How does PedGNN perform when trained and tested on the synthetic PedSynth dataset vs. real-world JAAD and PIE datasets? Does it show potential for good synth-to-real transfer?

8. What experiments are conducted to analyze the complementarity of PedSynth with JAAD and PIE datasets? How much improvement is obtained by combining them vs. using them alone? 

9. PedGNN relies on AlphaPose for extracting pedestrian skeletons from images. How does using ground truth skeletons from PedSynth compare against using AlphaPose outputs? Is there a domain gap introduced?

10. Qualitative examples are shown illustrating PedGNN predictions on JAAD clips. Analyze these cases and explain scenarios where the model succeeds or struggles to make accurate crossing intention predictions.
