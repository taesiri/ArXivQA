# [Learning Exactly Linearizable Deep Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18261)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning model structure called the exactly linearizable (EL) model, which has greater expressive power than prior structured models while still being amenable to control system design. The key idea is to extend the structured Hammerstein-Wiener model by adding output feedback to the input transformation mapping. This feedback enables the model to represent a broader class of nonlinear dynamical systems that are exactly linearizable, meaning they can be transformed into linear systems using nonlinear state feedback and coordinate changes. The learning process is similar to prior structured models. For control design, the EL structure allows applying linear methods like LQR as well as nonlinear techniques like control barrier functions. The extra degrees of freedom improve modeling accuracy, as demonstrated for an automotive engine system. The designed control system successfully tracks output references under operational constraints, validating the EL model's utility for developing performant and safe nonlinear control systems. Overall, the EL model strikes an effective balance between model fidelity, control theoretic properties, and practical engineering applicability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a learning method for exactly linearizable dynamical models that facilitates control design by enabling the application of various linear and nonlinear control theories while achieving high model accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a learning method for exactly linearizable (EL) dynamical models. The key points are:

- The proposed EL model structure has higher expressive ability and accuracy compared to previous structured models like the structured Hammerstein-Wiener (S-HW) model, while still facilitating control design.

- The EL model structure guarantees that the learned model has EL properties and can explicitly obtain a dynamic feedback law to linearize the dynamics.

- Control design using the EL model is easy - it allows applying simple linear control methods like LQR, as well as nonlinear control methods like control barrier functions.

- Experimental validation on an automotive engine system demonstrates the EL model has better prediction accuracy over the S-HW model. The control simulation also shows successful tracking control performance under constraints using the proposed methods.

In summary, the main contribution is an EL modeling and control framework that achieves high accuracy, expressive ability and facilitates effective control design, as demonstrated on an engine test case.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes learning exactly linearizable (EL) models. How does the expressiveness and flexibility of EL models compare to other structured dynamical system models like LSTM networks or neural ODEs? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper shows EL models can represent multiple equilibria for the same input, unlike previous structured models. What are the implications of this in terms of model stability and control design? How can the issue of multiple equilibria be addressed? 

3. The control design method combines simple linear control with control barrier functions. What are the limitations of this approach compared to using more advanced optimal control methods? When would a more complex controller be necessary?

4. Integral control barrier functions are introduced to handle input-dependent output constraints. What other approaches could handle such constraints and how do they compare? What are the pros and cons of the I-CBF formulation?

5. How does the computational expense of the proposed method scale with the size of the EL model and controller parameters? Could the quadratic programs become prohibitively expensive for very fast or large systems?

6. Theoretical conditions are given in the appendix for when a system can be exactly linearized. How restrictive are these conditions for real-world nonlinear systems? How could they be relaxed?

7. What other classes of nonlinear systems beyond EL systems could the modeling-control framework be applied to? Could the method work for partially linearizable systems?  

8. The model is demonstrated on an automotive engine system. What other application domains could benefit from learning EL models, especially safety-critical domains?

9. How does the accuracy and stability of the proposed method degrade with inaccurate training data or unmodeled disturbances during testing? How could robustness be improved?

10. The paper assumes a continuous-time system formulation. How could the modeling and control framework be extended to discrete-time systems? What changes would need to be made?
