## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with goal-oriented partial differential equations (PDEs)-based systems for airfoil shape optimization. Specifically:

1) The paper addresses several key challenges in applying reinforcement learning for shape optimization with unstructured meshes, including mesh tangling, managing high-dimensional state spaces, and non-smooth geometries. Techniques are developed to improve mesh quality and handle geometric deformations.

2) The reinforcement learning algorithm is customized to align well with the optimization objectives, through careful neural network design, reward shaping, etc. This includes using Bézier curves for dimensionality reduction, attention mechanisms in the critic network, and tailored reward/penalty mechanisms.

3) The framework leverages state-of-the-art PDE solvers such as the dual-weighted residual (DWR)-based adaptation method to precisely calculate target functionals and guide the optimization. This allows handling complex physics-based environments.

4) The Twin Delayed DDPG reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted and tuned to enhance stability and performance for the shape optimization task.

5) Experimental validations are conducted for airfoil shape optimization objectives like drag minimization and lift-to-drag ratio maximization. The results demonstrate the capability to effectively optimize shapes in precision-demanding PDEs-based environments.

In summary, the key contribution is in innovatively combining reinforcement learning with PDE solvers in a goal-oriented manner for continuous shape optimization, while addressing critical challenges that arise in this context.
