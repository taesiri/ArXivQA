# [C-BEV: Contrastive Bird's Eye View Training for Cross-View Image   Retrieval and 3-DoF Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08060)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces C-BEV, a novel method for cross-view image retrieval that uses bird's eye view (BEV) maps as the embedding representation instead of vectors. The key insight is that BEV maps mitigate the challenge of mapping varying street-view camera poses with different appearances to the same aerial image. During training, the BEV map embeddings are compared by testing different hypothetical camera poses, allowing C-BEV to handle real-world cases where orientation is unknown. Despite only using a contrastive loss on image pairings for supervision, C-BEV learns to infer the 3-DoF camera pose on the matching aerial image without needing explicit pose labels. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, with substantial gains in challenging scenarios (e.g. 65.0% top-1 recall on VIGOR cross-area split with unknown orientation). C-BEV also achieves better mean pose error than recent supervised methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BEV representation and matching operation for handling ambiguity. Overall, this work pushes progress on cross-view retrieval, especially for practical applications without constraints on orientation or predefined search regions.
