# [DDMI: Domain-Agnostic Latent Diffusion Models for Synthesizing   High-Quality Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12517)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent works have introduced implicit neural representations (INRs) as a way to represent continuous signals like images, shapes, and videos using neural networks. Some methods have been proposed to generate INRs, but they typically operate by generating the weights of the neural network with fixed positional embeddings (PEs). This limits their expressivity and ability to generate high quality results across domains. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a domain-agnostic latent diffusion model called DDMI to generate high quality INRs. The key ideas are:

1) Propose a Discrete-to-Continuous Variational Autoencoder (D2C-VAE) that generates adaptive PEs instead of just network weights. This enhances expressivity.

2) Decompose the basis fields into multiple scales using Hierarchically Decomposed Basis Fields (HDBFs) to better capture multi-scale structure of signals.

3) Introduce Coarse-to-Fine Conditioning (CFC) to progressively condition the MLP on multi-scale PEs from coarse to fine, further enhancing expressivity.

Together, D2C-VAE, HDBFs and CFC allow high quality INR generation by focusing expressivity on PEs instead of just network weights.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of domain-agnostic DDMI to generate high quality INRs across image, shape, video and other domains

- Introduction of D2C-VAE to generate adaptive PEs instead of just network weights 

- HDBFs and CFC mechanisms to enhance multi-scale expressivity

- Extensive experiments across 7 datasets demonstrating versatility and state-of-the-art performance of DDMI over existing INR generative models

The proposed DDMI with its novel components sets a new state-of-the-art in versatile and high quality implicit neural representation generation across diverse data domains.

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing DDMI, a domain-agnostic latent diffusion model for generating high-quality implicit neural representations (INRs) across various signal domains like images, shapes, videos, and neural radiance fields.

2. Defining a Discrete to Continuous space Variational AutoEncoder (D2C-VAE) that generates adaptive positional embeddings and learns a shared latent space to connect discrete data and continuous functions.
