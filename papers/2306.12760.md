# [Blended-NeRF: Zero-Shot Object Generation and Blending in Existing   Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12760)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question and goal seems to be developing a method for editing specific regions in 3D scenes represented by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) using natural language text prompts. The key challenges stem from the implicit nature of NeRF scene representations, which makes local editing difficult compared to editing explicit 3D representations or 2D images. Specifically, the paper aims to develop an approach that:1) Can operate on any region of a real-world 3D scene represented by a NeRF2) Only modifies the specified region of interest, while preserving the rest of the scene3) Generates natural, multi-view consistent results that blend seamlessly with the existing scene4) Works for diverse scene types and text prompts, not restricted to a specific domain5) Enables complex edits like object insertion/replacement, blending, and texture modificationTo achieve this, the core hypothesis seems to be that a pretrained language-image model like CLIP can guide a NeRF model initialized from the original scene to synthesize new content for the region of interest, and this can be blended into the original scene using a novel volumetric blending technique. The paper explores this central hypothesis through experiments on real 3D scenes.In summary, the main research question is how to perform controllable, localized edits to NeRF scenes through natural language guidance, while preserving consistency. The key hypothesis is that language-image guidance and volumetric blending can achieve this effectively.
