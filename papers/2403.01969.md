# [AS-ES Learning: Towards Efficient CoT Learning in Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is an important emerging capability of large language models (LLMs), but smaller models struggle to acquire this ability. 
- Existing methods to transfer CoT reasoning to small models use seq2seq training on CoT data from LLMs. However, they simply generate more data rather than efficiently utilizing existing data.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new training paradigm called AS-ES (Abstractive Segments - Extractive Segments) learning that decomposes CoT data into abstractive reasoning steps (AS) and extractive context (ES).
- Curate specialized AS and ES datasets to train models iteratively, maximizing the value of existing data.  
- Explore using one (Uni-path) or two separate models (Dual-path) for generating AS and ES.

Tasks:
- Evaluate on two representative CoT-intensive tasks:
  - Math word problem (MWP) solving 
  - Impression generation from PET scan reports

Main Contributions:
- Propose AS-ES learning, a data-efficient way to transfer CoT abilities without needing additional data.
- Show AS-ES learning improves performance over direct seq2seq training for both MWP and PET tasks, using either uni-path or dual-path models. 
- Demonstrate a single small model can handle extraction and reasoning for CoT transfer, contrary to prior assumptions. 
- Provide analysis into why AS-ES learning is effective, offering insights into CoT dynamics.

Overall, the paper introduces an iterative training strategy called AS-ES learning that can more efficiently impart CoT abilities to small models by better utilizing existing data. Experiments on math and medical datasets validate the effectiveness. Analysis is also provided into the underlying mechanics of how AS-ES learning enables small models to acquire stronger CoT reasoning skills.
