# [AS-ES Learning: Towards Efficient CoT Learning in Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is an important emerging capability of large language models (LLMs), but smaller models struggle to acquire this ability. 
- Existing methods to transfer CoT reasoning to small models use seq2seq training on CoT data from LLMs. However, they simply generate more data rather than efficiently utilizing existing data.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new training paradigm called AS-ES (Abstractive Segments - Extractive Segments) learning that decomposes CoT data into abstractive reasoning steps (AS) and extractive context (ES).
- Curate specialized AS and ES datasets to train models iteratively, maximizing the value of existing data.  
- Explore using one (Uni-path) or two separate models (Dual-path) for generating AS and ES.

Tasks:
- Evaluate on two representative CoT-intensive tasks:
  - Math word problem (MWP) solving 
  - Impression generation from PET scan reports

Main Contributions:
- Propose AS-ES learning, a data-efficient way to transfer CoT abilities without needing additional data.
- Show AS-ES learning improves performance over direct seq2seq training for both MWP and PET tasks, using either uni-path or dual-path models. 
- Demonstrate a single small model can handle extraction and reasoning for CoT transfer, contrary to prior assumptions. 
- Provide analysis into why AS-ES learning is effective, offering insights into CoT dynamics.

Overall, the paper introduces an iterative training strategy called AS-ES learning that can more efficiently impart CoT abilities to small models by better utilizing existing data. Experiments on math and medical datasets validate the effectiveness. Analysis is also provided into the underlying mechanics of how AS-ES learning enables small models to acquire stronger CoT reasoning skills.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel training paradigm called AS-ES learning that improves chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models by segmenting existing chain-of-thought data into abstractive and extractive parts and training the models iteratively on those segmented datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of AS-ES learning, a novel data-efficient training paradigm that maximizes the intrinsic value of existing chain-of-thought (CoT) data to train small models without needing additional data augmentation. This approach segments CoT data into abstractive segments (AS) and extractive segments (ES), then uses an iterative learning process tailored for AS and ES.

2) An exploration of using one unified small model versus two separate small models for extractive and abstractive tasks in AS-ES learning. The results show that a single small model, when trained properly with the AS-ES approach, can successfully handle both tasks - suggesting limitations previously attributed to small models' inherent capabilities can be substantially reduced through improved data utilization strategies.  

3) Providing a theoretical analysis of why AS-ES learning is effective, offering insights into the underlying dynamics of chain-of-thought reasoning. The key discovery is that AS-ES learning works by enabling small models to achieve a lower loss boundary compared to direct training approaches.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating a novel, data-efficient AS-ES training approach to unlock more of small models' potential for complex chain-of-thinking tasks requiring reasoning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Abstractive Segments - Extractive Segments (AS-ES) learning paradigm. Can you explain in detail how this paradigm works and what are the key differences from prior methods for distilling chain-of-thought abilities to small models? 

2. The paper discusses various strategies for segmenting complete chain-of-thought (CoT) statements into abstractive vs. extractive parts, including entropy-oriented, location-oriented, loss-oriented, and similarity-oriented methods. Can you analyze the relative merits and limitations of each segmentation strategy? Which tends to work better and why?

3. The paper constructs specialized AS and ES datasets from the segmented CoT data and structures the data differently for training extractive vs. abstractive abilities. Can you explain the rationale behind the proposed data organization strategies and why they are tailored for enabling iterative AS-ES learning? 

4. Both dual-path and uni-path learning frameworks are explored for AS-ES training. What are the key implementation differences between these two frameworks? What inferences can be made about the necessity of separate models for extraction vs. reasoning based on the experimental results?

5. Multiple combinations of segmentation methods and learning frameworks are evaluated on two distinct CoT-intensive tasks. Can you analyze the results to identify broader task-independent conclusions as well as insights that seem specific to certain tasks? What explains the divergence?  

6. Can you discuss the impact of key hyperparameters in AS-ES learning, including the AS/ES segmentation ratio β and the normality inclusion ratio γ for PET summarization? How does the optimal configuration depend on factors like the task, model size, etc.?

7. The paper hypothesizes that limitations in small models' CoT abilities stem more from training paradigm choice rather than intrinsic model capacity. Does the analysis of loss boundaries and performance improvements from AS-ES learning provide convincing evidence to support this claim? Why or why not?

8. How does the choice of checkpoint selection criteria for AS-ES-trained models differ from typical seq2seq models? What metrics would you prioritize for iterative generation tasks and why? How might the selection impact experimental conclusions?

9. The paper claims AS-ES learning works by lowering the loss boundary compared to direct seq2seq training. Do you think the evidence presented provides sufficient theoretical grounding for why and how it lowers this boundary? What additional experiments could help strengthen or refine this hypothesis?  

10. What do you see as the most significant limitations of the AS-ES learning strategy proposed in this work? Can you suggest extensions or open problems for further research to build on these ideas?
