# [Composable Function-preserving Expansions for Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06103)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we incrementally scale up transformer-based neural networks in a function-preserving way during training to achieve better performance with lower computational cost? 

The key hypothesis seems to be:

By applying proposed composable function-preserving transformations that expand different dimensions of the network architecture (e.g. number of layers, size of representations, etc.), it should be possible to progressively increase the model capacity without altering its functionality. This will enable efficiently scaling up models during training to match the performance of larger networks trained from scratch, but with less compute required.

In summary, the paper introduces composable architectural expansion transformations that can dynamically grow transformer models while preserving their function, in order to train larger networks more efficiently. The central research question is whether this incremental scaling approach can match the performance of static large models with lower training costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing six composable function preserving transformations that can be applied to incrementally increase the size of transformer-based neural networks. Specifically:

- The paper proposes transformations to expand the MLP internal dimension, number of attention heads, size of attention head outputs, size of attention inputs, size of layer representations, and number of layers. 

- For each transformation, the authors provide a proof that initializing certain added parameters to zero results in exact function preservation after applying the transformation. This allows expanding the model capacity while preserving the functionality.

- The transformations are designed to be composable, so they can be combined to jointly scale multiple dimensions of the architecture. They can also be applied incrementally throughout training to dynamically increase the model size.

- Compared to prior work on function preserving expansion of transformers, the proposed set of transformations covers more architectural dimensions and is more composable. The techniques could enable more efficient training of large transformer models by reusing pretrained smaller models.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive and composable set of techniques to incrementally scale transformer architectures in a function preserving manner, which could enable more efficient training pipelines. The theoretical analysis and proofs provide justification for the techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes six composable function preserving transformations to incrementally scale transformer architectures in width (MLP size, # heads, head size, attention size), depth (# layers), and height (hidden dimension) while exactly preserving model functionality, allowing progressive training of larger models from smaller pretrained ones.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of scaling up transformer models:

- The idea of expanding models in a function-preserving way is not entirely new, but this paper proposes the most comprehensive set of composable expansion methods to date. Previous works like Bert2Bert, Staged Training, and Deep Fusion introduced related concepts, but were more limited in scope. 

- The mathematical formalism and proofs of exact function preservation for each method are a key contribution. This level of rigor is important for justifying that model expansions can safely maintain performance and enable incremental training.

- Applying expansion techniques to progressively scale up models over the course of training has been proposed conceptually before, but not extensively validated. This paper lays the theoretical groundwork to make progressive scaling more practical.

- Most prior expansion methods focus only on width (size of layers) or depth (number of layers). A strength of this work is considering expansions along multiple dimensions like representation size, number of heads, etc. This provides more fine-grained control over scaling.

- The techniques aim to be general and composable for application to diverse transformer architectures. This flexibility is important given the rapid evolution of models in this field.

- The work is still quite theoretical. More empirical validation of training large models via these expansion techniques at scale would be needed to fully demonstrate their capabilities and limitations.

In summary, this paper makes excellent theoretical contributions regarding composable transformer expansions. Follow-on work is still needed to thoroughly demonstrate the practical benefits, but this provides a strong foundation and pushes forward the state of the art in principled model scaling methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Further exploring composability and applying the proposed transformations incrementally throughout training to progressively increase model capacity. The authors suggest this could enable more efficient training of large models.

- Applying neural architecture search (NAS) techniques to find optimal schedules and architectures when expanding models using the proposed transformations. This could help determine the best way to expand models for a given task and compute budget.

- Testing the proposed transformations empirically at scale during training to validate if they enable matching or exceeding the performance of training large models from scratch at lower cost. The authors were not able to run large-scale experiments in this initial study.

- Exploring alternative definitions of the transformations that achieve function preservation without requiring zero initialization. The authors mention the proposed forms are simple but minimally constraining.

- Extending the transformations to other model architectures beyond transformers, like convolutional networks. The principles may generalize.

- Applying the techniques to transfer learning by expanding a pretrained model before fine-tuning on a downstream task, instead of training a larger model from scratch.

In summary, the main directions are exploring composability and incremental expansion, neural architecture search, large-scale empirical validation, alternate definitions, generalization, and transfer learning applications. The core idea of efficient capacity expansion throughout training seems very promising.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes six composable transformations that can be applied to incrementally increase the size and capacity of transformer-based neural networks in a function-preserving way. The six transformations target scaling different dimensions of the architecture: MLP internal dimension, number of attention heads, attention head output dimension, attention input dimension, transformer layer input/output dimension, and number of layers. For each proposed transformation, the paper provides a proof that initializing the added parameters in a certain way (usually to zero) ensures exact function preservation, allowing continued training of the expanded model. These composable transformations could enable more efficient training of large transformer models by progressively growing the architecture during training rather than training large models from scratch.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes six composable transformations that can be applied to incrementally increase the size of transformer-based neural networks while preserving functionality. This allows the capacity of models to be expanded as needed without changing the model's behavior. The six proposed transformations target different dimensions of the architecture: 1) size of MLP internal representation, 2) number of attention heads, 3) size of attention head outputs, 4) size of attention inputs, 5) size of layer inputs/outputs, and 6) number of layers. For each transformation, the paper provides a proof of exact function preservation given minimal initialization constraints on the added parameters. 

The proposed methods aim to enable more efficient training of large transformer models by allowing architectural expansion throughout training, rather than training large models from scratch. The transformations are designed to be composable, so multiple dimensions can be expanded jointly or different subsets applied incrementally. Experiments demonstrate matching the quality of larger transformer models by starting from a smaller pretrained model and incrementally expanding it using the proposed methods. This reduces overall training cost while still achieving the same final architecture and quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:

The paper proposes six composable function preserving transformations that can be applied to incrementally increase the size of transformer-based neural networks while preserving functionality. The six transformations target expanding different dimensions of the architecture: 1) MLP internal dimension, 2) number of attention heads, 3) size of attention head outputs, 4) size of attention inputs, 5) transformer layer input/output dimension, and 6) number of layers. For each transformation, the paper defines how existing parameters are expanded and proves that function preservation is achieved by initializing the added parameters to zero, under minimal constraints. These transformations allow progressively scaling up transformer models during training while retaining prior functionality, which can reduce overall training costs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Training large neural networks like Transformers requires a lot of computational resources and time. The ability to reuse parameters from smaller pretrained models or dynamically scale up model size during training could reduce this cost.

- The paper proposes 6 composable transformations that can expand different aspects of a Transformer model (MLP size, number of attention heads, attention dimensions, hidden dimension, number of layers) in a function preserving way. 

- Function preserving means the transformed larger model represents exactly the same function as the original smaller model. This allows expanding model capacity without losing prior training progress.

- The paper provides proofs that each proposed transformation preserves function given some minimal constraints on initializing the new parameters (mostly zero initialization).

- These composable transformations could allow flexible ways to scale up a model progressively during training or create model families branched from a common small pretrained model.

- The techniques aim to enable more efficient training pipelines to reach larger end model sizes by reusing knowledge from smaller models and avoiding some repeated training effort.

In summary, the key problem is the high training cost of large Transformer models, and the paper proposes function preserving expansion techniques to try to improve training efficiency.
