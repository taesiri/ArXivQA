# [IGANN Sparse: Bridging Sparsity and Interpretability with Non-linear   Insight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Feature selection is critical for predictive model accuracy and interpretability, but intrinsic methods like lasso fail to capture non-linear relationships. This limits performance on complex data.
- Generalized additive models (GAMs) can uncover non-linear effects but lack built-in sparsity for interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes IGANN Sparse, a GAM using extreme learning machines, with a sparsity-inducing layer to enable non-linear feature selection.

Contributions:
1) A novel approach to fast training of sparse neural networks via extreme learning machines
2) Incorporation of this into the IGANN GAM framework as IGANN Sparse
3) Validation showing IGANN Sparse maintains predictive accuracy of non-sparse IGANN while significantly reducing features
4) Demonstration of IGANN Sparse's utility in non-linear feature selection and exploratory data analysis

Overall, the paper introduces IGANN Sparse to address limitations of existing methods for non-linear feature selection. By combining sparsity with the modeling flexibility of neural GAMs, IGANN Sparse keeps predictions accurate while enhancing interpretability through feature reduction. Experiments confirm strong performance versus other models, establishing IGANN Sparse as a promising tool for both prediction and exploration of complex datasets in information systems research.
