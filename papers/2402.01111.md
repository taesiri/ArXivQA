# [Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play under Adaptivity   Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01111)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with adaptivity constraints. In practical MARL applications like autonomous vehicles, frequently updating policies incurs high cost. Therefore, the algorithms need to minimize policy changes while still achieving good performance. However, existing MARL algorithms with low adaptivity only apply to single agent settings. This paper aims to design a self-play MARL algorithm that works for two-player zero-sum Markov Games, with near optimal adaptivity and sample complexity simultaneously.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a policy elimination algorithm with a novel schedule of "stages", where policies get updated only at the beginning of each stage. In the initial stages, the algorithm constructs an "absorbing" MDP to handle infrequently visited state-action pairs. Then in each stage, the algorithm evaluates all policies byoptimism, eliminates suboptimal ones, and mixes the remaining policies for execution. The number of episodes in each stage increases double exponentially. 

Main Results:
- The algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^2S^2ABT})$ regret with only $O(H+\log\log T)$ policy changes, where $S,A,B$ are number of states and actions, $H$ is horizon, $T$ is number of steps. Both bounds match the optimal values.
- The algorithm framework also applies to multi-player bandit games and reward-free MARL, achieving near optimal regret and batch complexity simultaneously. 
- To the best of knowledge, this is the first MARL algorithm with optimal adaptivity constraints. The results strictly improve over existing works that either have no adaptivity guarantees or only apply to single agent settings.

In summary, this paper proposes the first MARL algorithm that achieves near optimal batch complexity and sample complexity at the same time. The policy elimination framework with a novel schedule provides an effective solution for adapting MARL algorithms to practical scenarios.
