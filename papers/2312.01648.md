# [Characterizing Large Language Model Geometry Solves Toxicity Detection   and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01648)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel geometric perspective to characterize the internal representations and capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors first provide an exact characterization of the multi-head attention mechanism as constructing a Minkowski sum of convex hulls, whose dimensionality grows with stronger contextual dependencies in the input text. Leveraging this insight, they demonstrate how increasing the input text's intrinsic dimension through relevant prompting allows bypassing LLM safeguards against generating toxic text. Next, the paper shows how LLM feedforward networks intrinsically implement continuous piecewise affine spline operators, exponentially partitioning their input space. Motivated by this geometric spline formulation, the authors derive 7 simple but highly informative features per LLM layer, capturing properties like average sign patterns and distance to decision boundaries. Experiments demonstrate how just 224 such unsupervised features (over 7B parameters) from Llama-2 and Mistral suffice to accurately detect input text toxicity, determine prompt domains, and even tackle tasks like the Jigsaw challenge - significantly outperforming prior feature-based and fine-tuned approaches. Beyond providing theoretical insights into LLM representations, this work introduces practical methods leveraging exact geometric characterizations, enabling safer and more reliable language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper characterizes the geometry of large language models by deriving interpretable features that solve toxicity detection and generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides a geometric characterization and understanding of the internal representations learned by large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the multi-head attention (MHA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) components. 

2) It shows that the output embedding space of the MHA can be seen as a Minkowski sum of convex hulls, and derives results on how the intrinsic dimension of this space depends on the sparsity of the attention matrices. This understanding is then used to craft prompts that can bypass toxicity filters.

3) It formulates the MLP as a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) operator or spline, and shows that its expressivity grows exponentially with the MHA's intrinsic dimension. 

4) It derives 7 interpretable geometric features per LLM layer based on the CPA/spline formulation, totalling 224 features for a 32 layer LLM. These features are shown to be useful for various downstream tasks like domain classification, toxicity detection, and disentangling data modalities, without any training or fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contribution is providing an exact geometric perspective and accompanying features to understand and characterize representations learned by LLMs, with applications to practical tasks like toxicity detection.

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral have shown breakthrough capabilities, but little is understood about their internal representations and how to extract informative features for various downstream tasks. 

- Current approaches have limitations: 1) Prompt engineering is unreliable and unable to explicitly extract knowledge, 2) Learning sparse classifiers requires labeled data which is noisy and expensive.

- The paper aims to bring light to the geometric properties governing LLMs in order to precisely characterize their representations and enable solving tasks like toxicity detection.

Key Contributions
1) Provided geometric understanding of LLM building blocks - multi-head attention (MHA) and MLP:
- Showed MHA output lives in a manifold that is the Minkowski sum of convex hulls of embedded tokens. This shows embeddings live in a constrained space based on preceding tokens.

2) Derived 7 interpretable spline features per layer that capture key properties of the MLP partitioning. 

3) Demonstrated the features can disentangle modalities and solve tasks without training:
- Performed domain classification of prompts with 99% AUC.
- Solved Jigsaw toxicity challenge with 96% AUC outperforming prior models.
- Detected toxicity with 99% AUC, 17% higher than best existing model.

4) Showed features enable low-latency detection suitable for production.

5) Provided insights into limitations of current RLHF schemes against toxic generation.

Overall, the paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions for understanding, characterizing and leveraging LLM representations through an elegant geometric perspective focused on their intrinsic properties.
