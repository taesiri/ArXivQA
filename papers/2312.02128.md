# [Can we truly transfer an actor's genuine happiness to avatars? An   investigation into virtual, real, posed and spontaneous faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02128)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the differences and similarities between facial expressions of real humans and corresponding computer graphics (CG) animated faces, focusing specifically on expressions of happiness. The research uses several datasets of real human faces from previous works, separated into "posed" and "spontaneous" categories, and transforms them into CG faces using deep learning facial reconstruction techniques. Facial action units related to happiness from the Facial Action Coding System are analyzed, including intensity levels of cheek raiser (AU6) and lip corner puller (AU12). The transformed CG faces are compared to the real faces using statistical analysis and metrics including ANOVA, Tukey HSD tests, cosine similarity, and structural similarity index. Case studies are also conducted on CG media characters to examine artist-enhanced facial expressions. 

Key findings indicate significantly higher AU intensity levels in posed vs spontaneous datasets, with real faces also having higher intensities than CG faces. A "smoothing" effect is observed from real to CG, decreasing intensities around 70-80%, allowing more freedom for artists to exaggerate expressions later. While gender differences are mostly insignificant, upper face AUs have higher correlations between real and CG for posed sets, while lower face AUs correlate better for spontaneous sets. Media character case studies confirm similar patterns and smoothing from real to CG. Overall, the research suggests genuine human facial emotion is not effectively transferred to CG faces directly, and artist intervention is still needed to enhance emotional authenticity.
