# [Adapting Newton's Method to Neural Networks through a Summary of   Higher-Order Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optimizing high-dimensional loss functions (like when training neural networks) using gradient-based methods is challenging. Methods like Newton's method require computing the Hessian matrix which is infeasible for large parameter spaces. 

- On the other hand, methods like Cauchy's steepest descent use minimal second-order information but converge slowly. There is a need for an optimization method that balances using second-order information and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method to efficiently summarize higher-order derivatives of the loss function by projecting them onto a lower-dimensional space based on a partition of the parameters. 

- This is used to develop a Newton-like second-order optimization method that does not require computing the full Hessian matrix. Instead, it computes a smaller "pseudo-Hessian" matrix according to the parameter partition.

- The method interpolates between Cauchy's steepest descent (coarsest partitioning) and Newton's method (finest partitioning). It takes into account interactions between parameter groups unlike approximations that use block diagonal Hessian matrices.

Main Contributions:
- An efficient way to extract higher-order information about the loss function by projecting higher-order derivatives onto a lower-dimensional space based on a parameter partition.

- A scalable second-order optimization algorithm using the projected second-order information (pseudo-Hessian). Maintains interactions between parameters while avoiding large Hessian computations.

- Demonstration on neural networks that unlike common approximations, layers far away from each other still interact from an optimization perspective.

- A framework that unifies and generalizes methods like Cauchy's descent and Newton's method through the choice of parameter partitioning. Allows exploring the spectrum between them.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient way to extract useful second-order optimization information without needing to compute large Hessians, leading to a scalable yet interactively rich Newton-style method.
