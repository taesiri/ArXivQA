# [A Convenient Category for Higher-Order Probability Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02547)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing the notion of "quasi-Borel spaces" as a new foundation for higher-order probability theory and probabilistic programming languages. Specifically, the paper shows:- Quasi-Borel spaces form a cartesian closed category that supports higher-order functions, unlike the traditional category of measurable spaces which is not cartesian closed. This allows defining probability distributions on higher-order functions.- There is a natural notion of probability measure on quasi-Borel spaces. The space of all probability measures forms a monad, providing semantics for probabilistic programming languages. - Quasi-Borel spaces allow proving results like de Finetti's theorem that only hold for certain "well-behaved" measurable spaces classically. This allows better managing the sources of randomness compared to arbitrary measurable spaces.- Key ideas involving randomization can be expressed more cleanly using the function space structure of quasi-Borel spaces. For example, the randomization lemma which shows probability kernels arise from random functions becomes a statement about a quotient space.- Quasi-Borel spaces are given a canonical categorical status using the notion of extensional presheaves. They conservatively extend standard Borel spaces and can serve as their higher-order counterpart.So in summary, the main contribution is providing a new foundation for probability theory and semantics of probabilistic programs that supports higher-order functions and handles randomness better than arbitrary measurable spaces. The notion of quasi-Borel space is the key conceptual innovation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces quasi-Borel spaces, a new foundation for probability theory that supports higher-order functions and continuous probability distributions while still allowing key results like de Finetti's theorem.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces the notion of quasi-Borel spaces as a new foundation for higher-order probability theory and probabilistic programming languages. Here are some key ways it relates to other work:- It builds on the authors' prior work on using the category of functors $[\mathbf{SMeas}^{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ as a model of higher-order probability theory. Quasi-Borel spaces are more concrete and well-pointed.- It is inspired by notions like quasi-topological spaces and diffeological spaces from topology/geometry, but applies the idea of structured spaces to probability theory. - It relates to work on probabilistic powerdomains, as an alternative foundation that avoids some of their difficulties. The measures resemble continuous random variables.- It connects conceptually to domains of random variables from domain theory. An open question is making this connection formally.- It is complementary to recent operational semantics for probabilistic languages, providing a denotational semantics based on quasi-Borel spaces.- The results on exchangeability generalize de Finetti's theorem by better managing the randomness source. This relates to work on computable probability.Overall, the paper carves out a novel approach to higher-order probability theory using quasi-Borel spaces. It demonstrates the usefulness of this notion and relates it to several threads of research. The concrete and well-pointed setting appears to offer advantages over previous category-theoretic models.
