# [Answering from Sure to Uncertain: Uncertainty-Aware Curriculum Learning   for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01510)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Answering from Sure to Uncertain: Uncertainty-Aware Curriculum Learning for Video Question Answering":

Problem:
- Video question answering (VideoQA) requires models to reason over video content and answer questions. Despite progress, existing works do not consider the impact of the order of training samples or the uncertainty in the data. 

- A key challenge is quantifying the difficulty of video-question pairs for curriculum learning. Using only training loss as a measure of difficulty is problematic, as it does not precisely reflect inherent sample difficulty.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes uncertainty-aware curriculum learning (UCL) for VideoQA, where uncertainty is used to measure sample difficulty. This better captures intrinsic complexity. 

- To quantify and mitigate uncertainty, the authors formulate VideoQA as a stochastic computation graph, treating hidden representations as stochastic variables. This enables defining two uncertainties: feature uncertainty (inherent noise) and predictive uncertainty (model confidence).

- These uncertainties guide the curriculum - initially easier, low uncertainty samples get higher weights, with more difficult ones progressively included. This is integrated into existing VideoQA frameworks.

Main Contributions:
- Novel UCL method for VideoQA that leverages uncertainty for superior difficulty measurement and scheduling.

- Probabilistic modeling of VideoQA via stochastic computation graphs to capture uncertainty. Defines feature and predictive uncertainties.

- Integrates approach into VideoQA models and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Uncertainty provides meaningful quantification.

- Establishes versatility of framework - seamlessly incorporates into diverse VideoQA models, consistently improving performance.

In summary, the paper makes video question answering more reliable by using uncertainties to focus the learning, as well as quantifying the model's reliable region of prediction. The probabilistic modeling and curriculum learning approach is model-agnostic and delivers superior performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware curriculum learning framework for video question answering that progressively trains models from simpler to more complex video-question pairs by utilizing uncertainty captured through probabilistic modeling to measure and schedule difficulty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a self-paced curriculum learning (SPL) framework for video question answering (VideoQA), where the difficulty of data is measured by the uncertainty that reflects the inherent characteristic of data. This allows the model to learn from easier examples to more complex ones in a meaningful order.

2. It proposes probabilistic modeling for VideoQA by treating it as a stochastic computation graph to capture the data uncertainty and mitigate its negative impact. Specifically, it models the hidden representations of videos and questions as stochastic variables and uses variational inference for answer prediction. 

3. It defines two types of uncertainty within the probabilistic modeling framework - feature uncertainty that gauges the intrinsic uncertainty in the data, and predictive uncertainty that quantifies the model's confidence in its predictions. These are used to guide the curriculum learning process.

4. It integrates VideoQA models into the proposed uncertainty-aware curriculum learning framework and conducts comprehensive experiments that demonstrate superior performance and meaningful uncertainty quantification.

In summary, the main contribution is an uncertainty-aware curriculum learning framework for VideoQA that leverages uncertainty modeling to progressively train models from simpler to more complex video-question pairs in a principled manner.

The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware curriculum learning framework for video question answering, where the difficulty of samples is measured by uncertainty rather than the conventional use of training loss. To capture and mitigate the impact of uncertainty, the authors formulate videoQA as a stochastic computation graph via probabilistic modeling and variational inference. Two types of uncertainty are defined - feature uncertainty and predictive uncertainty - which guide the curriculum learning process. The method is evaluated on several VideoQA datasets and shows improved performance compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches.
