# [Image Coding for Machines with Edge Information Learning Using Segment   Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image compression is important for efficient transmission and storage, but conventional compression methods optimize for human vision rather than machine vision. 
- Existing image compression for machines (ICM) methods have limitations:
    - ROI-based methods place computational load on the encoder to create ROI maps
    - Task-loss methods are tailored to specific recognition models and not robust
    - Region learning methods cannot preserve background well

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new ICM method called SA-ICM that uses edge information learning. 
- It trains an learned image compression (LIC) model using only the edges detected from segmentation maps created by Segment Anything. This removes textures while retaining shape.
- The method does not require additional inputs like ROI maps or task losses. It works for multiple recognition tasks.
- The training procedure is also applied to Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) to create an SA-NeRV model tailored for video compression for machines.

Main Contributions:
- SA-ICM removes textures more aggressively than prior region learning methods, giving better compression rates.
- It also incidentally removes facial details, providing some privacy protection.  
- Works well for detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. Robust to different models and datasets.
- SA-NeRV gives better recognition accuracy on decoded videos compared to baseline NeRV model.
- Overall, SA-ICM sets new state-of-the-art for ICM across multiple computer vision tasks. The edge information learning procedure is broadly applicable.

In summary, the key innovation is an edge-based learning approach for ICM and video compression that works very well across different vision models and tasks without requiring extra information as input. It advances the state-of-the-art in multiple ways.
