# [Single-Stage Optimization of Open-loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth,   Symbolic Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Finding stable limit cycles is important for designing stable gaits in legged robots. However, explicitly enforcing stability constraints during limit cycle optimization is challenging. General eigenvalue problem formulations result in difficult optimization problems.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate open-loop limit cycle stability as a constrained trajectory optimization problem using two methods: (1) Monodromy matrix method (2) Poincaré map method. 
- Develop specialized CSP formulations to efficiently constrain the spectral radius for stability:
   - Frobenius norm 
   - Power iteration
   - Eigendecomposition
   - Schur decomposition
- Show monodromy matrix method is more reliable than Poincaré map through swing leg stabilization experiments.

Key Contributions:
- Novel constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formulations for bounding spectral radius that explicitly encode stability in trajectory optimization.
- First known approach to pose limit cycle stability as a single-stage constrained optimization problem with stability constraints and objectives.
- Demonstration that monodromy matrix method is more reliable for stability-constrained optimization than Poincaré map.
- Showcase efficiency of proposed approach by generating stable hopping gaits for SLIP model in under 2 seconds.

In summary, this paper presents a new framework for rapidly generating stable limit cycles in dynamical systems by formulating stability explicitly during trajectory optimization. Several CSP formulations are introduced to efficiently constrain spectral radius. The methods are demonstrated on swinging leg and SLIP models, showing the approach can quickly produce stable limit cycles.
