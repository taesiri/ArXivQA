# [Mitigating the Problem of Strong Priors in LMs with Context   Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17692)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) suffer from the problem of "strong priors", where the model learns certain patterns so strongly that when prompted with related context, it continues those patterns while ignoring other explicit instructions. This causes issues like repeating common misconceptions, succumbing to prompt injection attacks, and struggling with questions where the correct answer closely resembles an incorrect but more common pattern.

- The problem can get worse with scale, a phenomenon called "inverse scaling", making it crucial to understand and mitigate as models continue to grow.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper conceptualizes LMs as "mixture models", combining multiple learned distributions - one that captures the true continuation, and another reflecting strong priors. 

- They introduce "context extrapolation" to shift sample generation towards the true continuation distribution. This works by deliberately weakening the prompt to make it more susceptible to strong priors, then extrapolating between the likelihoods of the original and weakened prompts.

- Specifically, they remove the task description from the start of prompts to get a "weakened prompt". They take a linear combination of logits from the original and weakened prompts to favor the desired behavior.

- The approach requires no model retraining, operating at inference time using two forward passes instead of one.

Contributions:
- The paper offers a formal account of mechanisms behind strong priors based on mixture models.

- It develops a practical technique to mitigate strong priors that works across models and tasks, using prompt manipulation and likelihood extrapolation.

- Experiments over 11 models on 4 datasets show median gains of 27-40% task completion proportion over baselines, providing evidence for the mixture model view and the potential of steering model behavior via modified prompts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a technique called Context Extrapolation to mitigate the problem of language models overly relying on strong priors rather than full context when generating text, improving performance on tasks related to prompt injection attacks, pattern matching suppression, and redefining concepts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a formal mechanism based on mixture models to explain how "strong priors" cause poor model performance on certain tasks. The paper frames language models as combining multiple underlying distributions, one of which can sometimes overly dominate the others.

2) Developing a novel technique called "Context Extrapolation" to mitigate the influence of strong priors. The technique involves creating a weakened prompt more susceptible to the unwanted prior, extrapolating from the weakened prompt back towards the original prompt, in order to reduce the impact of the strong prior.

The paper shows through experiments that this technique leads to significant improvements in model performance on several datasets and models, providing evidence for the utility of the proposed mixture model view. The technique offers a way to elicit capabilities that may be dormant in models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Strong priors - The phenomenon where language models learn certain patterns so strongly from the training data that when presented with related prompts, they tend to continue the patterns regardless of other instructions. Can cause problems like repeating misconceptions or prompt injection attacks.

- Inverse scaling - The observation that for some tasks related to strong priors, larger language models actually perform worse, becoming more susceptible to issues like prompt injection attacks.

- Mixture models - The authors model language models as combining multiple underlying data generation processes, like a process that generates the correct continuation versus a separate process that repeats common patterns (strong priors).  

- Context extrapolation - The proposed technique to mitigate strong priors, where the model makes predictions based on an altered prompt designed to elicit stronger priors, and then extrapolates between the original prompt and altered prompt.

- Logits - The pre-softmax activation values that represent each token's likelihood under the model. The context extrapolation technique works by taking a linear combination of logits.

- Prompt injection attacks - When models ignore explicit instructions and instead pursue an alternative task introduced partway through the prompt. An example of strong priors overriding instructions.

The key goals are understanding and mitigating issues like prompt injection attacks, repetition of misconceptions, and more generally getting language models to robustly follow instructions and avoid strong priors overriding them. The context extrapolation technique is introduced to address this.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes viewing language models as mixture models combining multiple underlying generative processes. What are some ways this conceptual framework could be further developed? For example, could the mixture components be explicitly modeled and estimated? 

2. The context extrapolation method relies on a parameter α that controls the degree of extrapolation. What approaches could be used to automatically select an optimal value of α per prompt? Could α be learned as part of model training?

3. How does the performance of context extrapolation vary when using different methods to construct the weakened prompt? Are there programmatic ways to systematically construct effective weakened prompts? 

4. The paper tests context extrapolation on models up to 13B parameters. How does the method perform on larger models exhibiting more extreme inverse scaling dynamics? Does the optimal α parameter change?

5. Can context extrapolation be combined with other methods for steering language models, like activation addition and classifier-free guidance? Would these yield further improvements on problematic tasks?

6. The paper focuses on mitigating strong local priors. Could similar extrapolation approaches address tasks with non-local or more complex interdependence between the task description and input data parts of the prompt? 

7. What relationships exist between model scale (size and compute) and the gains achieved from context extrapolation? Understanding this could further illuminate the inverse scaling phenomenon.  

8. How does context extrapolation affect language model capabilities on common benchmarks, not just problematic cases? Are there ways to apply it selectively to support, but not disrupt, performance?

9. Can the context extrapolation approach be adapted to other modalities and generative model architectures, like diffusion models for image generation? What would be required?

10. The method relies on access to model internals like logits. How could context extrapolation be adapted to work in black-box scenarios without internal access?
