# [TPD: Enhancing Student Language Model Reasoning via Principle Discovery   and Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Larger language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 tend to outperform smaller models like GPT-3.5 in reasoning tasks, but using larger models can be over 10x more expensive. 
- Existing methods to transfer reasoning abilities from larger to smaller models have limitations around requiring lots of fine-tuning data/time or continuous involvement of the larger teacher model.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a teacher-student framework called "Teaching via Principle Discovery" (TPD) to address these limitations.
- TPD has two stages - principle generation and principle exploitation. 
- In the principle generation stage, the teacher model summarizes a list of corrective principles based on common errors made by the student model on practice questions. 
- In the principle exploitation stage, the teacher uses the principles to refine instructions and select the most informative examples to include in the prompt to guide the student's learning.

Key Contributions:
- TPD reduces the need for teacher model involvement during testing, so the smaller student model can operate independently.
- Principle discovery and exploitation enables the student model to learn from both teacher guidance and its own past mistakes.
- Experiments across 8 reasoning tasks show TPD improves student model performance by 6.2% on average over standard prompting methods.
- Analysis explores effective ways to inject generated principles into the student model - selecting new examples outperforms directly providing the principle list.

In summary, TPD introduces an innovative teacher-student framework that leverages principle discovery to effectively transfer reasoning abilities from larger to smaller language models in a way that minimizes teacher involvement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces Teaching via Principle Discovery (TPD), a principle-based teacher-student framework where the teacher LLM generates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the student LLM's errors to guide refinement of instructions and selection of instructive examples from a validation set, enabling the student model to learn from both the teacher's guidance and its own mistakes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Teaching via Principle Discovery (TPD), a principle-based teacher-student framework that enhances the effectiveness of teacher models in educating student models. TPD mimics the interaction between a teacher and a student using a principle-based approach - the teacher LLM generates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the student LLM's errors, guiding refinement of instructions and selection of instructive examples. This enables the student model to learn from both the teacher's guidance and its own mistakes, while reducing teacher model involvement during testing. The effectiveness of TPD is demonstrated through experiments on eight reasoning tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Teaching via Principle Discovery (TPD) - The name of the proposed teacher-student framework.

- Principle generation - One of the two main stages of TPD, where the teacher model generates problem-solving instructions and summarizes principles based on student errors.  

- Principle exploitation - The second main stage of TPD, where principles are injected to improve the student model's reasoning capability.

- Problem-solving instruction - Instructions from the teacher model that provide a high-level problem-solving method along with examples.

- Error summarization - The process where the teacher model analyzes errors made by the student model on practice questions to identify common issues and summarize corrective principles.

- Symbolic reasoning - One category of reasoning tasks experimented on, requiring the use of symbols and logical relationships. 

- Arithmetic reasoning - The other category of reasoning tasks, involving mathematical computations and word problems.

- Chain-of-thought prompting - A baseline prompting method that provides reasoning steps as examples.

- Program-of-thought prompting - Another prompting approach using programs and an interpreter for arithmetic tasks.

So in summary - TPD, principle generation/exploitation, problem-solving instructions, error summarization, symbolic/arithmetic reasoning, and prompting methods are important keywords related to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a principle-based teaching framework called "Teaching via Principle Discovery" (TPD). How does TPD improve upon existing teacher-student frameworks for transferring reasoning abilities between language models? What are its key innovations?

2. The TPD framework comprises principle generation and principle exploitation stages. In the principle generation stage, how does the teacher model summarize principles based on the errors made by the student model? What is the rationale behind letting the student model learn from its own mistakes?

3. When generating the problem-solving instruction, why does the teacher model include both a high-level reasoning method description and concrete examples? What are the relative merits of each component? 

4. During principle exploitation, why does selecting new examples guided by the principle list outperform directly injecting the list into the prompt? What theories of human learning motivate this design choice?

5. How does the critique-and-revise strategy perform in utilizing the generated principles? Why does it lead to degraded performance? What might this reveal about the behavior and constraints of language models?

6. Why does the TPD framework perform poorly on resolving factual knowledge errors, as observed in the GSM8K and SVAMP datasets? What modifications could address this limitation?

7. The paper validates TPD on symbolic and arithmetic reasoning tasks. How might the approach perform on more complex reasoning scenarios? Would new challenges emerge regarding principle generalization?

8. Could the TPD framework scale to settings involving longer chains of principles and reasoning? If not, what innovations would enable such scaling? 

9. How suitable is the TPD framework for offline settings where the teacher model is unavailable during inference? Could any components be modified to reduce reliance on the teacher?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on improving reasoning and avoiding simple memorization. Could the TPD approach induce unwanted biases or limit imagination and creativity? How might such risks be assessed?
