# [TOD-Flow: Modeling the Structure of Task-Oriented Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems using pre-trained language models have limitations in transparency, controllability and adaptability. 
- Workflow-based dialogue models require manual design of workflows and fine-tuning of models.
- Real-world dialogues are often unstructured, making modeling as workflows challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a novel approach called "TOD-Flow" to infer a graph called the "TOD-Flow graph" from dialogue data annotated with dialog acts. 
- The TOD-Flow graph captures causal dependencies between dialog acts in terms of "can", "should" and "should not" relationships.
- These relationships provide fine-grained control over what a model can, should and should not predict.
- The graph elucidates reasoning behind predictions and allows manipulation without retraining models.
- The graph is integrated with any dialogue model to enhance prediction performance, transparency and controllability.

Main Contributions:
- Generalize the subtask graph framework to task-oriented dialogue by proposing the TOD-Flow graph.
- Present learning algorithms to model "can", "should" and "should not" relationships between dialog acts.
- Demonstrate the TOD-Flow graph can be combined with dialogue policies and end-to-end models without retraining them.
- Show significant improvements in dialog act classification and end-to-end response generation tasks on MultiWOZ and SGD benchmarks.
- Provide qualitative analysis showing the TOD-Flow graph better matches human-annotated graphs compared to prior approaches.
