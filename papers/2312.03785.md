# [Sports Recommender Systems: Overview and Research Issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03785)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Sports Recommender Systems: Overview and Research Issues":

Problem:
- There is an increased need for recommender systems that can support people in sports-related contexts to foster healthy living, improve personal well-being, and increase performance. 
- However, sports recommender systems are an emerging field and there are still many open challenges and research issues to be addressed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of existing applications of recommender systems in sports across different areas:
   - Recommending trainings, focused practices, equipment, videos, destinations/routes
   - Recommending tactics & strategies in competitions  
   - Recommending individuals, talents and team configurations
   - Handling injury prevention and recovery
   - Fostering healthy living through nutrition and training recommendations
   - Event handling and recommendation of events, designs and related items

- For each area, the paper discusses techniques that have been applied such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, knowledge-based recommendation, group recommenders. 

- Simple working examples are provided to demonstrate how the techniques can be applied in sports contexts.

Main Contributions:
- First in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art in sports recommender systems covering different sports segments.
- Identification of limitations of existing works - most approaches focus on basic recommendations, lack explanatory capabilities, don't fully leverage psychological models of persuasion and human decision making.
- Analysis of key open research issues including the need for bundle recommendations, new evaluation metrics, integrating explanations and psychological aspects, real-time recommendations, and leveraging large language models.

- The paper stimulates future research by providing a foundation of sports recommender systems landscapes along with discussing promising research directions in this emerging field.
