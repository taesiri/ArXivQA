# [LoRA-Enhanced Distillation on Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06899)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach that combines Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with model distillation to efficiently compress diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. The key innovation is sharing the weight matrix between the teacher and student models during distillation. This eliminates the memory overhead of maintaining separate teacher parameters while enabling efficient adaptation using LoRA's low-rank matrices. Experiments demonstrate a 40% reduction in inference time thanks to distillation and a remarkable 50% decrease in memory consumption by applying LoRA-enhanced distillation. Notably, this memory optimization is achieved without compromising on image quality or alignment with prompts. The results showcase the potential of this technique to advance large diffusion models by simultaneously enhancing efficiency, reducing resource utilization, and maintaining performance. In summary, LoRA-enhanced distillation delivers unequivocal optimizations for inference speed and memory footprint without trading off on quality.
