 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MuVieCAST, a modular multi-view consistent style transfer framework for generating stylistically consistent images across multiple views of a scene. The method comprises three main components: a style transfer network (TransferNet) that transforms images to the desired style, a content-style feature extraction module that preserves content while matching artistic features, and a geometry learning module that enforces consistency using multi-view stereo techniques. Experiments demonstrate MuVieCAST's effectiveness for downstream tasks like point cloud fusion, mesh reconstruction and novel view synthesis. A user study shows 68% preference over recent methods, attributed to richer textures and preservation of semantics. The modular design supports various backbone architectures, making MuVieCAST a versatile solution for multi-view style transfer across domains. Key advantages are fast training, robustness to sparse views, flexibility in style options, and integration with different 3D vision techniques.
