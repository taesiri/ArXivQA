# [Generative models for visualising abstract social processes: Guiding   streetview image synthesis of StyleGAN2 with indices of deprivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00570)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a novel application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to study visual aspects of social processes and inequality in cities. A StyleGAN2 model was trained on a custom dataset of 14,564 Google Street View images from London. The images were inverted to find latent representations that were compared across three inversion techniques. Each image was associated with socioeconomic metadata from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, allowing the mapping of visual features related to income, health, and environmental quality within the latent space. New synthetic images could then be generated by conditioning along directions encoding deprived versus privileged areas. The resulting visualizations uncover distinct architectural styles, public space usages, and streetscape elements tied to abstract concepts like education and income levels. Despite limitations in dataset bias and validation, the generative framework shows promise for gaining visual insights into urban inequality and repurposing GANs as part of social scientific methodology.
