# [Efficiently Trained Low-Resource Mongolian Text-to-Speech System Based   On FullConv-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource languages like Mongolian is challenging due to lack of data. 
- Existing TTS models that use RNNs are slow to train and computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel TTS model called "FullConv-TTS" based entirely on CNNs without any RNN components. This is a two-stage end-to-end model.
- In stage 1, a Text2Mel network synthesizes a low-resolution mel spectrogram from text using an encoder-decoder with attention architecture made of 1D causal convolutions. 
- In stage 2, a spectrogram super-resolution network (SSRN) upsamples the mel spectrogram to a full STFT spectrogram.
- They also employ data augmentation techniques like SpecAugment, time warping and spectrogram resize to improve robustness.
- A guided attention loss is used to speed up attention training.

Main Contributions:
- FullConv-TTS significantly reduces training time compared to RNN-based TTS models, while achieving competitive quality. It cuts training time by over 6x compared to Tacotron2.
- The model quality is shown to approach FastSpeech2, while having 40% faster inference. 
- Data augmentation and guided attention allows the model to generalize better with limited Mongolian data.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the individual impact of the proposed data augmentation techniques.
- The solution achieved 12th place in the NCMMSC2022 Mongolian TTS challenge.

In summary, this paper proposes an efficient CNN-only TTS approach designed specifically for low-resource settings, verified through Mongolian language experiments. The techniques to improve data efficiency and training speed are the main highlights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient end-to-end Mongolian text-to-speech system called FullConv-TTS based entirely on convolutional neural networks, which significantly reduces training time while ensuring acceptable audio quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system called "FullConv-TTS" that is based entirely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and does not use any recurrent neural network (RNN) components. The key points are:

- FullConv-TTS is a two-stage TTS model that first synthesizes a low-resolution coarse mel spectrogram from text, and then synthesizes a high-resolution full STFT spectrogram. This allows faster training compared to end-to-end models.

- By not using any RNNs, FullConv-TTS significantly reduces training time compared to models like Tacotron while ensuring acceptable speech quality and naturalness. Experiments show it trains around 3x faster than Tacotron 2.

- To address the low resource problem for Mongolian language data, data augmentation techniques like SpecAugment and spectrogram resizing are used to improve model robustness and generalization.

- A guided attention loss is proposed to make attention training faster by penalizing attention distributions that are far from the diagonal.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a fast-to-train TTS model based fully on CNNs, along with data augmentation and guided attention techniques tailored for low-resource Mongolian TTS.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel text-to-speech system called FullConv-TTS that is based entirely on convolutional neural networks without any recurrent neural network components. What is the motivation behind using an architecture composed of only CNNs rather than RNNs? What advantages does this provide?

2. The FullConv-TTS model uses a two-stage training strategy, first generating a low-resolution mel spectrogram from text and then generating a high-resolution STFT spectrogram. What is the rationale behind this two-step approach rather than directly predicting the STFT spectrogram from text in one step? 

3. The paper employs data augmentation techniques like SpecAugment, time warping, frequency masking and time masking. Why are these specific techniques useful for improving model robustness and generalization ability in a low-resource setting? How do they help mitigate overfitting?

4. Explain the Guided Attention Loss function used in the FullConv-TTS model. How does adding this auxiliary loss help optimize and speed up the training of the attention module? 

5. The paper compares FullConv-TTS against baseline models like Tacotron, Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech 2. How does FullConv-TTS perform in terms of audio quality, naturalness scores and computational efficiency metrics? What are its strengths and weaknesses?

6. Analyze the ablation experiments conducted with different data augmentation techniques. What improvements do techniques like SpecAugment and spectrogram resizing provide individually and in combination?

7. The synthesis phase attention matrix sometimes fails in models like Tacotron. The paper proposes heuristic rules to modify the attention matrix. Explain this approach and how it improves model robustness.

8. What additional techniques could be explored to further improve the audio quality and naturalness of FullConv-TTS while retaining its computational efficiency advantages?

9. The paper identifies migrating learnings with universal pre-trained models as a direction for future work. Explain how pre-trained models could help in the context of low-resource TTS for Mongolian.

10. The paper aims to develop a computationally lightweight Mongolian TTS suitable for commercial usage. What practical deployment challenges might need to be addressed to build viable commercial applications?
