# [StableDrag: Stable Dragging for Point-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "StableDrag: Stable Dragging for Point-based Image Editing":

Problem:
- Point-based image editing methods like DragGAN and DragDiffusion allow manipulating images by dragging handle points to target locations. However, they suffer from two key issues: inaccurate point tracking and incomplete motion supervision.  
- Inaccurate point tracking fails to precisely locate the updated handle points due to misleading similar surrounding points. This causes unsatisfactory editing.
- Incomplete motion supervision at some steps leads to poor optimization quality and point tracking drift. This results in unstable dragging with deterioration in visual quality.

Proposed Solution - StableDrag:  
- Discriminative Point Tracking: Learns a tracking model using a tailored similarity function to accurately distinguish handle points from visually similar distractors. Achieved by suppressing distractors and enhancing handle points.
- Confident Motion Supervision: Uses tracking confidence score to assess manipulation quality. If quality falls below a threshold, it employs template features to supervise handle points until quality improves.  

Key Contributions:
- A discriminative point tracking method that allows precisely locating updated handle points, enabling stable long-range manipulation.
- A confidence-based latent enhancement strategy that improves optimization quality at each step for high-quality editing. 
- Two models - StableDrag-GAN and StableDrag-Diff using the above techniques to achieve stable dragging upon GAN and diffusion models respectively.
- Extensive qualitative experiments and quantitative assessment showing precise editing with higher quality than prior arts.

In summary, the paper proposes unique designs for a stable drag-based image editing framework called StableDrag, which attains more precise point-level control and generates higher-fidelity editing results.
