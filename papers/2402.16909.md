# [Impact of Physical Activity on Quality of Life During Pregnancy: A   Causal ML Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quality of life (QoL) tends to decline during pregnancy, especially for overweight/obese women and those experiencing stress or anxiety. Physical activity (PA) has potential to improve QoL.
- Prior studies on impact of PA on pregnant women's QoL rely on correlation analysis rather than causal relationships. Such methods have limitations in revealing causes, biases, etc. 
- Self-report measures of PA have subjective biases. Wearables provide more accurate continuous PA data.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a Causal Machine Learning (CML) approach to examine causal effect of PA on QoL, using wearable data plus maternal/context data.
- CML has two components:
   1) Causal discovery - Construct causal graphs showing relationships between variables using algorithms like PC, GES, GIES.
   2) Causal inference - Estimate causal impacts of PA on QoL scores using meta-learner model, calculating Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
- Validate estimates using refutation analysis techniques.

Data Collection and Analysis:
- 48 overweight/obese pregnant women monitored using Oura ring and questionnaires. Divided into active vs less active groups based on 150min/week PA guideline.  
- Causal graph constructed showing relationships between PA, QoL, and mediators like medical history, depression, etc.
- ATE estimates showed being active causes increased physical and psychological QoL scores compared to less active group, across pregnancy and postpartum.  
- Refutation testing validated robustness of estimates.

Key Contributions:
- Developed a wearables-based CML approach to assess causal impact of PA on QoL rather than just correlations. 
- Incorporated multiple data sources - wearables, questionnaires, context data.
- Demonstrated being physically active during pregnancy/postpartum improves QoL scores by average of 7.3 and 3.4 units for physical and psychological health.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed CML solution and data analysis performed, as well as the major contributions demonstrating a causal effect of physical activity on improved quality of life for overweight/obese pregnant women.
