# [Tumor segmentation on whole slide images: training or prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tumor segmentation in whole slide images (WSIs) is important for cancer diagnosis but challenging due to the large size and variability of tumors. 
- Existing approaches like patch/superpixel classification and semantic segmentation have limitations in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency or ability to directly output a segmentation mask.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores visual prompting as an alternative approach that allows leveraging a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) model for tumor segmentation without extensive fine-tuning. 
- A prompt example (image with tumor segmentation) is provided as context to guide the model to perform segmentation on new images.

Methods:
- Compare patch, superpixel, semantic segmentation and visual prompting methods on 6 training WSIs and 3 test WSIs spanning 3 organs. 
- Visual prompting uses SegGPT model with a lung tumor image prompt. Other methods use customized CNNs trained on the 6 images.

Main Results:
- Visual prompting achieves the best overall dice score (0.856) without any training, outperforming other approaches.
- It also has near real-time performance (4 seconds per WSI).
- These results highlight the potential of visual prompting for medical image analysis despite limited training data.
- Choice of appropriate prompt images is important for good performance.

Main Conclusion:
- Visual prompting with pretrained ViTs provides an promising alternative to training-based methods for tumor segmentation with small datasets, offering accuracy and efficiency gains.

In summary, the key novelty is in demonstrating the capabilities of visual prompting for medical image segmentation in low data settings. The results show it can match or outperform common training-based methods without any parameter updating.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper compares tumor segmentation approaches on whole slide images, demonstrating that visual prompting can achieve comparable or better performance than classical training-based methods without extensive fine-tuning, given appropriate prompt examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating the efficacy of visual prompting for tumor segmentation on whole slide images with limited training data. Specifically:

- The paper compares visual prompting against three training-based approaches (patch classification, superpixel classification, semantic segmentation) for tumor segmentation on 6 training WSIs from 3 organs.

- The results show that with just a single prompt example, visual prompting achieves comparable or better Dice scores than the other approaches without any fine-tuning. For example, visual prompting obtains the best average Dice score of 0.856 across the test set.

- The paper argues that this demonstrates the potential of leveraging large pre-trained vision transformer models via visual prompting for medical image analysis tasks where annotated training data is limited.

- The visual prompting approach also has computational advantages, requiring only 4 seconds on average to segment a whole slide image compared to over 19 minutes for patch classification.

In summary, the main contribution is using a small sample of training data to demonstrate the power of visual prompting to effectively segment tumors on gigapixel whole slide images without extensive fine-tuning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a lung tumor image as the prompt example for SegGPT. How would using different prompt examples, such as a breast or kidney tumor image, impact the segmentation performance? Would organ-specific prompts further improve the results?

2. The paper evaluates performance using only dice score. What other evaluation metrics could be used to compare the segmentation methods more thoroughly, such as false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, etc? 

3. For the patch-based classification method, what impact would using different patch sizes have on the segmentation accuracy and computation time? Was any analysis done on optimal patch size?

4. The simple CNN architecture used for superpixel classification contains only 3 convolutional layers. How would using a more complex CNN architecture impact performance? Would the additional computation time be worth any accuracy gains?

5. For the semantic segmentation method, the encoder network ResNet34 was pre-trained on natural images. Would further fine-tuning this encoder on histopathology images improve segmentation performance? 

6. The paper mentions the limited receptive field in U-Net. How does the receptive field of U-Net compare to that of visual transformer models like ViT? Does the self-attention mechanism effectively increase receptive field size?

7. For visual prompting with SegGPT, what is the effect of the normalization step applied to match color distributions with the prompt example? How does performance change without this normalization?

8. The inference time for SegGPT is higher than semantic segmentation. Could model distillation or quantization be applied to SegGPT to reduce model size and improve efficiency?

9. For all methods, extensive data augmentation is used during training. Is there an optimal augmentation strategy? Or does more aggressive augmentation always improve robustness?

10. How well would these approaches generalize to segmenting other structures beyond tumors, such as glands, nuclei, vessels, etc? Would the same methods apply or be sufficient?
