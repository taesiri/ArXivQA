# [Tumor segmentation on whole slide images: training or prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tumor segmentation in whole slide images (WSIs) is important for cancer diagnosis but challenging due to the large size and variability of tumors. 
- Existing approaches like patch/superpixel classification and semantic segmentation have limitations in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency or ability to directly output a segmentation mask.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores visual prompting as an alternative approach that allows leveraging a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) model for tumor segmentation without extensive fine-tuning. 
- A prompt example (image with tumor segmentation) is provided as context to guide the model to perform segmentation on new images.

Methods:
- Compare patch, superpixel, semantic segmentation and visual prompting methods on 6 training WSIs and 3 test WSIs spanning 3 organs. 
- Visual prompting uses SegGPT model with a lung tumor image prompt. Other methods use customized CNNs trained on the 6 images.

Main Results:
- Visual prompting achieves the best overall dice score (0.856) without any training, outperforming other approaches.
- It also has near real-time performance (4 seconds per WSI).
- These results highlight the potential of visual prompting for medical image analysis despite limited training data.
- Choice of appropriate prompt images is important for good performance.

Main Conclusion:
- Visual prompting with pretrained ViTs provides an promising alternative to training-based methods for tumor segmentation with small datasets, offering accuracy and efficiency gains.

In summary, the key novelty is in demonstrating the capabilities of visual prompting for medical image segmentation in low data settings. The results show it can match or outperform common training-based methods without any parameter updating.
