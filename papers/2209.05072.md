# [Hard Negatives or False Negatives: Correcting Pooling Bias in Training   Neural Ranking Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05072)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to correct the pooling bias in labeled datasets for training neural ranking models (NRMs). 

The key points are:

- Existing NRMs training relies on negative sampling over unlabeled data. Hard negative sampling from strong retrievers is shown beneficial for model generalization. However, it may introduce more false negatives (unlabeled positives) and hurt NRMs training.

- The root cause of the false negative issue is the pooling bias during dataset construction, where only documents retrieved by some basic systems are labeled. This leads to potential existence of unlabeled positives.

- The paper formulates the false negative problem as learning from biased labeled datasets. It proposes a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) to jointly learn a relevance model and a selection model to estimate relevance scores and selection propensities for correcting the pooling bias.

- Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate NRMs learned with CET achieve significant gains against state-of-the-art methods in addressing false negatives during training.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by explicitly modeling and correcting the pooling bias in labeled datasets, NRMs can better distinguish false negatives from hard negatives and achieve more effective training. The proposed CET approach is shown empirically to support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) to address the false negative issue in training neural ranking models (NRMs) on labeled datasets with pooling bias. Specifically:

- The paper formulates the false negative problem in training NRMs as learning from labeled datasets with pooling bias, where unlabeled positives are mistakenly sampled as negatives.

- To solve this problem, the authors propose CET which jointly trains a relevance model to estimate documents' relevance and a selection model to estimate documents' selection propensity. The two models promote each other in a coupled learning manner.

- Based on the estimated propensities, CET derives sample weights to relax the effect of false negatives and achieve bias correction learning for the relevance model.

- Experiments on three retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that NRMs learned with CET significantly outperform baseline methods in ranking effectiveness.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying the root cause of false negatives as pooling bias, and proposing the coupled estimation technique to address it by joint learning of relevance and selection models. This allows NRMs to benefit from hard negatives during training.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions at the end of the paper:

1. Extend the proposed method to the listwise setting, where multiple negative samples are considered simultaneously to estimate the bias weights. This could further improve the estimation of bias weights.

2. Apply the proposed method in the first-stage retrieval to address the pooling bias problem. The authors focused on solving the pooling bias issue for training the neural ranker in this work. But the bias also exists in the training data for neural retriever models. Applying the method to debias the retriever training could be an interesting direction.

3. Investigate other potential applications of the proposed Coupled Estimation Technique (CET). The authors mention that CET could be potentially used in other scenarios with biased training data besides information retrieval. Exploring other applications of CET could be an important future work. 

4. Study the effect of different model architectures in the CET framework. As discussed in the paper, the performance gain of CET varies for different neural ranking models. Analyzing the impact of model architecture design choices could provide useful insights.

5. Extend CET to address other types of bias in IR training data beyond pooling bias, such as position bias and trust bias. The authors focused on pooling bias in this work, but other biases also widely exist in IR datasets. Expanding the technique to handle other biases could make it more generally applicable.

In summary, the main future directions are: applying CET in more scenarios like first-stage retrieval and other tasks; investigating the effect of techniques like listwise learning and model architecture design; and generalizing it to address other types of bias in IR training data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper focuses on addressing the false negative issue when training neural ranking models (NRMs) on labeled datasets with pooling bias. The pooling bias occurs because annotators only label documents selected by basic retrievers, causing unlabeled positives (false negatives) in the data. Hard negative sampling from stronger retrievers increases false negatives, hurting NRM training. To solve this, the authors propose a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) to jointly learn a relevance model and selection model on the biased data. The selection model estimates the propensity of a document being selected, which helps train the relevance model by downweighting false negatives. Experiments on three datasets show CET significantly improves ranking performance over methods like denoising and propensity weighting. Overall, CET provides an effective approach to correct pooling bias and train high quality NRMs from labeled IR datasets.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper addresses the issue of false negatives hurting the performance of neural ranking models (NRMs) when trained on datasets with pooling bias. Many large-scale IR datasets are constructed by having human annotators label the relevance of documents retrieved by some initial system. This leads to a pooling bias, where there may be many unjudged yet relevant documents (false negatives).  When training NRMs on such datasets and using top ranked results of a stronger retriever for hard negative sampling, performance degrades due to more false negatives. 

The authors propose a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) to jointly learn a relevance model and selection model to correct for the pooling bias. The relevance model estimates document relevance while the selection model estimates the likelihood of a document being selected for annotation. These two models are trained together, with the selection model providing weights to reduce the impact of likely false negatives. Experiments on MS MARCO, TREC DL, and DuReader datasets show CET can significantly improve ranking performance over methods that heuristically identify false negatives. CET also works well across different rankers and retrievers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) to address the false negative issue in training neural ranking models (NRMs) on labeled datasets with pooling bias. 

The key idea is to jointly learn a relevance model (implemented with NRMs) and a selection model on the biased dataset in a coupled manner. Specifically, the selection model estimates the propensity of each document being selected into the judgement pool during the labeling process. Based on the estimated selection propensities, the relevance model can distinguish false negatives from hard negatives and achieve bias correction learning with an inverse propensity weighting loss. In each training iteration, the selection model helps estimate bias weights in the loss function for the relevance model update, while the relevance model provides relevance scores to derive bias weights for the selection model update. By training both models simultaneously, CET is able to correct pooling bias and learn high-quality NRMs from the biased dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of false negatives when training neural ranking models (NRMs) on labeled datasets with pooling bias. Specifically:

- Many existing benchmarks for information retrieval rely on a pooling process to construct labeled datasets, where only a small subset of documents are judged by annotators for each query. This introduces pooling bias, where there could exist unlabeled positives (i.e. false negatives) in the dataset.

- NRMs are typically trained on these datasets by sampling negatives from the unlabeled data. When sampling top-ranked results from a stronger retriever as hard negatives, more false negatives are included, which hurts model training. 

- The root cause is the pooling bias in the dataset construction process. So the authors formulate this as a learning problem from datasets with pooling bias.

- They propose a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) to jointly learn a relevance model and a selection model on the biased dataset. The selection model helps identify false negatives to correct the bias during training.

- Experiments show NRMs learned with CET achieve significant gains compared to other techniques for addressing false negatives, and CET is robust across different datasets, retrievers, and ranking models.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying and formally modeling the pooling bias problem when training NRMs, and proposing a novel approach CET to correct this bias by joint learning of a relevance and selection model.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key terms and concepts are:

- Neural ranking models (NRMs): The paper focuses on training neural network-based ranking models for information retrieval tasks. NRMs are a major type of model used for ranking in modern IR systems.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper focuses on addressing the false negative issue when training neural ranking models (NRMs) on datasets with pooling bias. The root cause is that the labeling process relies on basic retrievers to select documents, thus missing out on unlabeled positives (false negatives). Hard negative sampling, which improves model performance in general machine learning, hurts here as it increases false negatives. The authors formulate this as a learning problem from biased data. They propose a Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) that simultaneously trains a relevance model (the NRM) and a selection model to estimate selection propensities. This allows adaptive weighting of false negatives to correct bias during training. Experiments on three benchmarks show NRMs learned with CET significantly outperform baseline techniques like thresholding and propensity estimation from a separate complete dataset. The method works for different rankers and retrievers. It is also robust to hyperparameters compared to alternatives. In summary, CET effectively addresses false negatives by tackling the fundamental pooling bias, leading to improved neural rankers.

This paper addresses the issue of false negatives when training neural ranking models (NRMs) for information retrieval tasks. It argues that the root cause of false negatives is the pooling bias introduced during the dataset construction process, where only documents retrieved by basic systems are labeled by annotators.
