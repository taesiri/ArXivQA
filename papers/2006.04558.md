# [FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop a fast, high-quality, and fully end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) system. Specifically, the authors aim to address limitations of previous non-autoregressive TTS models like FastSpeech, which rely on a complicated teacher-student training pipeline, inaccurate duration prediction, and information loss during knowledge distillation. 

The main hypothesis is that by:

1) Simplifying the training pipeline and using ground-truth targets instead of distilled outputs. 

2) Providing more accurate duration information and additional variance information like pitch and energy as inputs.

3) Modeling pitch variations using continuous wavelet transform.

4) Extending the model to directly generate waveforms instead of mel-spectrograms.

They can develop a faster TTS model (FastSpeech 2) that achieves higher voice quality than FastSpeech and other autoregressive models, while still enjoying the benefits of non-autoregressive models like fast and robust synthesis. They further hypothesize that extending this model (FastSpeech 2s) to directly generate waveforms can simplify the pipeline towards fully end-to-end TTS with minimal performance drop.

In summary, the main research question is how to develop a fast, high-quality, and end-to-end TTS system, with the central hypothesis that modeling additional variance information and simplifying the training process can achieve this goal.
