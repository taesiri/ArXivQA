## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a lifelong learning framework for multi-domain monocular metric depth estimation called Lifelong-MonoDepth. The method uses a lightweight multi-head network composed of a shared feature encoder and domain-specific depth prediction heads. This allows the model to estimate depth maps with correct absolute scales for different domains. To enable effective lifelong learning across domains with significant gaps, the method employs several techniques. It applies an uncertainty-aware knowledge distillation loss using predictions from the old model on new data to preserve knowledge of original domains. It also uses a small replay set from each domain for regularization. To handle variance in depth map quality across domains, the loss incorporates uncertainty prediction and consistency. For online inference, the method selects the domain-specific predictor based on minimum feature distance between the input and domain replay sets. Experiments on indoor NYU, outdoor KITTI and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that the approach achieves better stability and plasticity than baseline methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of lifelong learning for multi-domain monocular depth estimation. Specifically, it aims to develop a model that can continuously learn to estimate metric depth maps from different domains in a lifelong manner, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. The key challenges identified are:

1) Significant domain gaps between different datasets, leading to catastrophic forgetting when learning a new domain.

2) Imbalance in depth scales across different domains, making it difficult to learn a single model that can estimate absolute depth values across domains. 

To address these challenges, the main contributions of the paper are:

1) A lightweight multi-head framework with a shared encoder and domain-specific decoders to enable scale-aware depth estimation across domains.

2) An uncertainty-aware knowledge preservation method using uncertainty estimation and consistency losses to mitigate forgetting. 

3) A small amount of replay data from previous domains to handle significant domain gaps.

4) An online domain identification method during inference by selecting the predictor with minimum feature distance to the input image.

Through experiments on NYU, KITTI and ScanNet datasets, the paper demonstrates that the proposed method achieves much better stability and plasticity compared to baseline approaches for lifelong metric depth learning across different domains with large gaps.

In summary, the key novelty is in formulating and providing solutions for lifelong learning of monocular depth estimation across diverse domains with large gaps, which has not been sufficiently addressed before. The multi-head model design and uncertainty-aware knowledge preservation strategy seem to be the main technical contributions.
