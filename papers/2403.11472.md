# [Accelerating String-Key Learned Index Structures via Memoization-based   Incremental Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing updatable learned index structures face severe performance bottlenecks, specifically during the repetitive retraining of their machine learning models to incorporate changes from update queries like inserts and deletes. Retraining incurs huge compute overhead as it requires processing all key-position pairs, and the costs compound as the number of keys grows. This retraining competes for CPU resources with inference queries for serving index lookups, degrading overall system throughput. The problem is even more pronounced for variable-length string keys where the key matrix size blows up.

Proposed Solution - SIA:
The paper proposes SIA, an accelerated string-key learned index system, with two key ideas:

1. Algorithm Optimization: SIA utilizes a parallel matrix decomposition technique called QR decomposition (QRD) which allows computation reuse across retraining runs via "memoization". Specifically, only the QRD computation for newly inserted keys is performed while reusing prior QRD results for existing keys. This incremental retraining approach significantly reduces computational complexity. 

2. Hardware Acceleration: Further speedup is obtained by offloading the incremental retraining computation onto an FPGA accelerator. This not only accelerates training itself but also relieves CPU resources for inference queries. The FPGA implements optimized units for key training operations like QRD and matrix computations.  

Together, the algorithmic optimization and hardware acceleration provide a 2.6x speedup on average over state-of-the-art learned index systems like ALEX, LIPP and SIndex.

Key Contributions:

- Identifies scalability issues in current updatable learned indexes during retraining, especially for string keys

- Proposes SIA's incremental index learning algorithm that achieves compute reuse across retraining runs via memoized QR decomposition

- Accelerates SIA's algorithm on an FPGA to both speed up training and free up CPU cores for inference

- Delivers 2.6x higher throughput over CPU-only systems on YCSB and Twitter cache traces

In summary, the paper makes a case for bringing together algorithm-hardware co-design to tackle the key bottleneck of retraining in updatable learned indexes for strings. SIA is shown to significantly boost system throughput via its dual software-hardware approach.
