## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey of Route Recommendations: Methods, Applications, and Opportunities":

Problem: 
Route recommendation is a key functionality for intelligent transportation and smart city applications such as navigation systems, traffic management, logistics, and emergency response. With the rapid development of information technologies and ubiquitous urban sensing, large volumes of data regarding citizens' trajectories and transportation networks are collected. This enables more intelligent, efficient and personalized route recommendations. However, developing such smart routing systems based on big trajectory data poses significant research challenges. 

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on route recommendation research from the perspective of urban computing. It reviews a large variety of methods, from traditional machine learning approaches to modern deep learning techniques, as well as their applications.

The traditional machine learning methods are categorized into five groups - search-based, probability-based, biomimetic, clustering-based and constraint-based. Representative algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) are introduced. The deep learning methods are divided into five types: hybrid models extending traditional methods, sequence-based models capturing temporal relations, graph-based models encoding spatial structures, multi-modal models fusing heterogeneous data, and reinforcement learning models formulating route recommendation as sequential decision making problems.

The paper also demonstrates numerous applications of route recommendations, including tourism planning, economic route optimization, personalized travel recommendations, security-related routing and indoor navigation.  

Main Contributions:
- Provides a comprehensive survey on route recommendation literature from the viewpoint of urban computing
- Categorizes and compares a wide variety of traditional machine learning and modern deep learning methods
- Reviews many novel applications related to route recommendation 
- Summarizes open challenges and promising future directions such as improving model interpretability, exploring multi-modal learning, and incorporating large pre-trained models.

The paper helps researchers quickly understand the state-of-the-art and foresee future trends in the route recommendation field. The rich content also allows readers from other domains to learn key methodologies and applications.
