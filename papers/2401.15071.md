# [From GPT-4 to Gemini and Beyond: Assessing the Landscape of MLLMs on   Generalizability, Trustworthiness and Causality through Four Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15071)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper analyzes the capabilities and limitations of recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini across four modalities - text, code, image, and video. It notes that despite impressive advances, a gap persists between MLLM performance and public expectations for reliable and transparent downstream applications.  

Methodology:
The paper conducts a qualitative evaluation of proprietary models like GPT-4 and Gemini as well as 6 open-source MLLMs across 230 manually designed test cases. The test cases assess model capabilities across 3 criteria - generalizability, trustworthiness and causality reasoning within each modality. 

Main Findings:  
1. Overall text and coding capability: Gemini lags behind GPT-4 but outperforms open-source models. Among open-source models, Mixtral outperforms Llama.  

2. Multilingual capabilities: Gemini excels due to precise translation of nuances and complex linguistic structures.

3. Reasoning abilities: Gemini struggles with multi-solution math, theorem proofs and commonsense reasoning compared to GPT-4.  

4. Domain knowledge: Gemini has superficial domain knowledge, unable to apply concepts to solve problems unlike GPT-4.

5. Text and code safety: Gemini lacks safety capabilities of GPT-4 and even open-source Llama-2.

6. Image capabilities: MLLMs exhibit some weaknesses in precise localization tasks and multi-image understanding. GPT-4 demonstrates overall best performance.


Main Contributions:
The paper contributes qualitative insights into strengths and weaknesses of current proprietary and open-source MLLMs to highlight research gaps for designing more reliable and transparent downstream applications. The structured evaluation methodology and findings provide guidance for improvement-oriented development of multi-modal AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively analyzes proprietary and open-source Multi-modal Large Language Models across text, code, image, and video modalities to assess their capabilities and limitations in terms of generalization, trustworthiness, and causality reasoning through qualitative evaluation of over 230 manually designed test cases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a qualitative evaluation of proprietary and open-source multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) across text, code, image, and video modalities. The key contributions are:

1. It evaluates the capabilities of closed-source models GPT-4 and Gemini as well as 6 open-source LLMs and MLLMs across 230 manually designed test cases covering aspects like generalization, trustworthiness, and causality reasoning. 

2. It summarizes the evaluation into 12 scores across 4 modalities and 3 properties to quantitatively compare model capabilities. 

3. It discovers 14 empirical findings highlighting strengths and limitations of current MLLMs, aiming to provide guidance for future improvement towards more reliable downstream applications.

4. It proposes to build an evolving leaderboard to keep adding more MLLMs and test cases over time to track progress in capabilities of latest models across different modalities.

In summary, through comprehensive qualitative evaluation, this paper strives to enhance understanding of current MLLM capabilities to help improve transparency and reliability for practical usage. The key contribution is the extensive analysis distilled into quantitative results, findings and proposals for an evolving leaderboard to track MLLM progress over time.

The paper conducts an extensive qualitative evaluation of proprietary (GPT-4, Gemini) and open-source MLLMs across four modalities - text, code, image, and video. It analyzes their capabilities, trustworthiness, and causality understanding through manually designed test cases. Some key findings relate to the strengths and limitations of current MLLMs in areas like multilingual abilities, reasoning, safety, and causality inferences. The goal is to provide insights into improving the reliability and transparency of MLLMs for downstream applications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the key differences in how the authors assessed generalization capability versus trustworthiness and causality reasoning across modalities? How do those differences reflect what is most important for real-world applications?

2. Why did the authors focus on qualitative assessment instead of solely quantitative metrics? What are the relative tradeoffs, and what factors influenced their choice of methodology?  

3. The authors evaluated 7 open-source models in addition to the proprietary GPT-4 and Gemini. What was their rationale for choosing those specific models to represent the capabilities of open-source alternatives, and what are the limitations of that selection? 

4. The paper analyzed common themes and gaps across modalities. What do you think are 1-2 of the most significant themes or gaps highlighted in the results? Why are those particularly notable?

5. Regarding the 14 key empirical findings, which one or two would you say are most surprising or unexpected? Why do those stand out?

6. The authors designed 230 manual test cases across modalities and categories. What principles, considerations, or methodology guided how those cases were designed and selected?  

7. How confident are you in the generalizability of these results to overall LLM/MLLM capabilities? What are limitations of manual qualitative testing at this relatively small scale compared to computational evaluations over much larger datasets?

8. How might the analysis change if 10x or 100x more test cases of similar depth were evaluated? Would we expect to see the same gaps, or might major new issues emerge in additional corners cases?

9. Regarding the score calculation method, what other ways could you quantify model capabilities based on the qualitative rankings? Would any alternatives better capture key strengths, weaknesses, and differences?  

10. If you could add an 11th key finding based on analyzing the results, what would that be? Are there any crucial issues or capabilities you feel were missed or not emphasized enough?
