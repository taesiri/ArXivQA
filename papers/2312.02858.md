# [Towards Causal Representations of Climate Model Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02858)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the potential of using causal representation learning, specifically the Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD) method, to uncover interpretable low-dimensional latent drivers underlying climate model data. The authors apply CDSD to emissions, temperature, and precipitation time-series from the CMIP6 and Input4MIPS climate datasets. For temperature and precipitation data, CDSD is able to infer representations that match known physical climate processes like ENSO and storm tracks, demonstrating its utility for evaluating climate models. However, CDSD struggles to find stable representations for emissions data, likely because anthropogenic emissions lack predictable temporal causal relationships that CDSD relies on. While challenges remain in applying CDSD for climate model emulation, the authors' findings highlight promising directions like modifying CDSD to incorporate climate-specific inductive biases. Overall, this work sheds light on using causal methods like CDSD to render machine learning-based climate emulators more interpretable and robust.
