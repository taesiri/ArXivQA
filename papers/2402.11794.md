# [Unveiling the Magic: Investigating Attention Distillation in   Retrieval-augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented generation frameworks use a retriever to select relevant information and a reader to incorporate it into the generation process. Attention distillation is an efficient training strategy where the reader's attention scores are used to supervise the retriever. 
- Despite its effectiveness, the detailed mechanisms behind the success of attention distillation remain unexplored. It's unclear which text segments gather more attention and how to assess attention quality.

Method:
- The authors conduct experiments with decoder-only reader models on QA tasks using the NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA datasets. 
- They train models using off-the-shelf and fine-tuned distillation, and analyze attention scores at the token level to identify key factors influencing learning quality.

Key Findings:
- Attention distillation works well with high-quality reader models but fails with low-quality ones, indicating attention score quality is critical.
- In high-quality readers, tokens most related to the answer and nouns in the question receive the most attention. 
- Two key indicators are proposed to measure distillation quality:
    1) Average attention score and correlation for tokens near the answer.
    2) Average attention score and correlation for tokens near question nouns.

Main Contributions:
- Provides the first comprehensive analysis quantifying the role of attention scores for training in retrieval-augmented models.   
- Identifies two commonalities in high-quality attention signals: higher attention to answer-related and question-related tokens.
- Introduces novel metrics to evaluate reader models' attention distillation ability, helping optimize training performance.

Limitations:
- Analysis is conducted on lightweight 1B parameter reader models. Testing on larger models is needed to confirm wider applicability of findings.
