## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces CoLLiE, a new library for efficient collaborative training of large language models. CoLLiE integrates techniques like 3D parallelism, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and optimizers like Lion and AdaLomo to enable more efficient scaling. It provides modular and customizable classes for configuration, models, datasets, training controllers, and more. Evaluations demonstrate CoLLiE's superior training efficiency over current solutions - significantly higher throughput in pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. The paper also analyzes memory consumption, finding actual usage exceeds simple parameter estimates, provides empirical assessment of different training methods' effectiveness for instruction tuning, and shares comprehensive details to allow both novice and advanced users to leverage CoLLiE's capabilities for efficient large language model training. Overall, CoLLiE offers an easy-to-use yet customizable library to facilitate efficient scaling and adaptation of large language models.
