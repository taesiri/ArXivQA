# [Multi-graph Graph Matching for Coronary Artery Semantic Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is the gold standard for assessing coronary artery anatomy and detecting blockages. 
- Deep learning methods for automatically generating semantic labels for coronary artery segments in ICAs face challenges due to the morphological similarity between branches.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multi-graph graph matching (MGM) algorithm for coronary artery semantic labeling in ICAs. 
- It models the coronary vascular tree from an ICA as a graph. Nodes are arterial segments, edges are connections between segments. Features are extracted from each node.
- MGM matches arteries from multiple ICA vascular tree graphs simultaneously. It assesses similarity between artery segments across graphs, considering cycle consistency between graph pairs.
- This allows matching of unannotated segments to annotated ones, enabling semantic labeling.

Key Components:
- Intra-graph feature embedding using graph convolutional networks and MLPs
- Learning intra-graph node affinity
- Cross-graph feature embedding to improve match reliability 
- Joint graph matching matrix and eigenvector decomposition for multi-graph matching
- Cycle consistency constraint 

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea of using multi-graph graph matching for labeling coronary arteries in ICAs
- Modeling vascular tree from ICA as a graph, with arterial segments as nodes
- Matching multiple graphs simultaneously while preserving cycle consistency 
- Significantly outperforms other methods for coronary artery semantic labeling (94.71% accuracy vs 72-90% for other methods)
- Opens possibilities for better analysis of coronary artery anatomy and pathology using ICA videos
