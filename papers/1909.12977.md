The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposes an activation decomposition framework to generate visual explanations for deep metric learning models. This allows generating an overall activation map highlighting important regions in each image, as well as point-to-point activation maps showing fine-grained correlations between parts of the two images.- Shows the proposed method is widely applicable to various deep metric learning models and tasks like image retrieval, face recognition, person re-identification without changing the model architecture.- Provides both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrating the proposed overall activation map is superior to prior methods like Grad-CAM.- Introduces two novel applications enabled by the point-to-point activation maps - cross-view pattern discovery and interactive retrieval. Experiments validate the importance of point-specific activation maps.- Overall, the paper presents a simple yet effective way to interpret what deep metric learning models focus on when making similarity judgements. The visual explanations offer insights into model behaviors and enable new applications.In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed activation decomposition framework can provide intuitive yet informative visual explanations for a wide range of deep metric learning models and uncover novel fine-grained information through point-specific activation maps. The experiments generally validate the effectiveness of this approach.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visual explanation for deep metric learning:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing an activation decomposition framework to generate both overall and point-specific activation maps for interpreting deep metric learning models. This provides a new way to visualize and understand which parts of the input images contribute most to the similarity score.- Most prior work on interpreting neural networks focuses on classification models. There is limited work exploring visual explanations specifically for deep metric learning. This paper helps fill that gap and shows the importance of interpreting metric learning models for tasks like image retrieval and verification.- A few prior papers have tried applying gradient-based methods like Grad-CAM to generate activation maps for metric learning models. However, this paper shows both theoretically and empirically that directly applying Grad-CAM has issues due to the gradient normalization. The proposed decomposition framework avoids this issue and generates better overall activation maps.- The idea of point-specific activation maps to show fine-grained correspondences between image parts is novel and not explored in prior interpretation methods. The applications on cross-view pattern discovery and interactive retrieval demonstrate the unique benefits of the point-specific maps.- Compared to prior heuristic or gradient-based methods, the proposed framework provides a simpler and more principled approach to interpret metric learning models by directly decomposing the similarity score. The formulation can handle complex network architectures commonly used for metric learning.- The paper comprehensively compares with Grad-CAM and ablative variants, providing both quantitative evaluation on localization and human studies to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. This level of thorough evaluation is lacking in some prior interpretation papers.Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on the relatively less studied problem of interpreting deep metric learning models. The decomposition framework, analysis of gradients, and applications of point-specific maps appear to be novel contributions compared to related literature. The comprehensive experiments and evaluations also strengthen the paper.
