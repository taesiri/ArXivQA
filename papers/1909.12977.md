# Visual Explanation for Deep Metric Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to provide visual explanations for deep metric learning models. Specifically, the paper aims to uncover which parts of two input images contribute the most to their similarity score predicted by a deep metric learning model. The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposes an activation decomposition framework to generate visual explanations for deep metric learning models. This allows generating an overall activation map highlighting important regions in each image, as well as point-to-point activation maps showing fine-grained correlations between parts of the two images.- Shows the proposed method is widely applicable to various deep metric learning models and tasks like image retrieval, face recognition, person re-identification without changing the model architecture.- Provides both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrating the proposed overall activation map is superior to prior methods like Grad-CAM.- Introduces two novel applications enabled by the point-to-point activation maps - cross-view pattern discovery and interactive retrieval. Experiments validate the importance of point-specific activation maps.- Overall, the paper presents a simple yet effective way to interpret what deep metric learning models focus on when making similarity judgements. The visual explanations offer insights into model behaviors and enable new applications.In summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed activation decomposition framework can provide intuitive yet informative visual explanations for a wide range of deep metric learning models and uncover novel fine-grained information through point-specific activation maps. The experiments generally validate the effectiveness of this approach.
