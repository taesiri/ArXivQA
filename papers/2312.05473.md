# [Self Model for Embodied Intelligence: Modeling Full-Body Human   Musculoskeletal System and Locomotion Control with Hierarchical   Low-Dimensional Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05473)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modeling and controlling the full human musculoskeletal system is very challenging due to its high complexity, high dimensionality, redundancies, and nonlinear dynamics. 
- Existing models are often limited to certain body parts and lack enough muscles.
- There is a lack of algorithms that can control over 600 muscles to generate realistic full-body human movements.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors build a comprehensive musculoskeletal model of the full human body with 90 segments, 206 joints, and 700 muscle-tendon units.
- They embed this model into a physics simulation engine (MuJoCo) for efficient dynamic simulations and interactions.
- They propose a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm called Two-Stage Hierarchical Training (TSHT) to control the high-dimensional model.
- TSHT uses hierarchical action space representation with muscle synergy in the first stage and autoencoder-based low-dimensional encoding of muscle activations in the second stage.

Main Contributions:
- A full-body musculoskeletal model with detailed segments, joints and muscles that enables simulation of complex neuromuscular body dynamics.
- An integrated simulation framework that supports efficient physics calculation and contact interactions.
- A two-stage hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm for high-dimensional control of full-body musculoskeletal models.
- Demonstration of model control for biomimetic movements, human-machine interaction, and simulation of pathological conditions.
- The model and algorithms are open-sourced to benefit musculoskeletal system research and human-interactive robot design.

In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive computational platform with modeling and control capabilities to promote understanding, simulation and design related to the intricate human musculoskeletal system.
