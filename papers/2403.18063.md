# [Spectral Convolutional Transformer: Harmonizing Real vs. Complex   Multi-View Spectral Operators for Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18063)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing vision transformers like ViT, Swin, and MLP-Mixer have limitations in effectively capturing both local and global representations from images. Spectral transformers like GFNet and WaveViT excel at global representations but struggle with local relationships. This work aims to develop a transformer that adeptly captures multi-scale visual information.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Spectral Convolutional Transformer (SCT) with a unique architecture synergizing spectral transforms and convolutions to capture global and local representations respectively. Two variants are introduced - SCT-C uses Cosine transform while SCT-H uses Hartley transform to capture global information along with a convolutional operator for local relationships. Deeper self-attention layers capture long-range dependencies.

Main Contributions:

- Novel architecture with staged integration of spectral (global) and convolutional (local) operators along with self-attention (long-range) 

- SCT-C achieves SOTA results on ImageNet with 85.9% top-1 accuracy for a large model, significantly outperforming prior vision transformers

- SCT-H uses Hartley transform for lower complexity and latency compared to complex spectral transforms like in GFNet and WaveViT

- Extensive ablation studies analyze optimal hyperparameter configurations and demonstrate superiority over alternate design choices

- Transfer learning evaluations on multiple datasets showcase SCT's efficacy across diverse domains

- Fine-tuning for downstream task of instance segmentation also exhibits state-of-the-art performance  

- Provides intuitive analysis of real vs complex spectral trade-offs in vision transformers to inform architectural designs

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through the carefully designed SCT architecture that creates new state-of-the-art benchmarks across multiple computer vision tasks while advancing the understanding of balancing performance and complexity in spectral transformer design.
