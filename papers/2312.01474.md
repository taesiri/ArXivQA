# [Distilling Functional Rearrangement Priors from Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Object rearrangement is a fundamental challenge in robotics that requires specifying precise goals to meet functional requirements. However, manually designing goals is difficult and does not scale, while learning from human annotations or heuristics limits generalization. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a novel approach to learn functional rearrangement priors by distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) into a conditional generative model. Specifically:

1) An autonomous data collection pipeline is created to obtain diverse arrangement examples using both a VLM (to generate arrangements) and an LLM (to refine them to better meet functional requirements). 

2) The collected examples are distilled into a conditional diffusion model that captures rearrangement priors. 

3) At test time, this model takes the initial configuration and generates compatible goals to fulfill functional needs for rearrangement.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to distill functional rearrangement priors from LLMs and VLMs into a conditional generative model.

- An LLM refinement approach to alleviate misalignment between VLM-generated examples and desired functional requirements.

- Extensive experiments including real-world robot deployment that demonstrate the method's effectiveness for goal specification and compatibility, significantly outperforming baselines.

- Analysis showing crucial roles for both the VLM and LLM in distilling high-quality rearrangement priors.

In summary, the key insight is to combine the generalization of large models with the compatibility benefits of conditional generative models for learning versatile rearrangement goals. Evaluations validate the method's capabilities on diverse configurations in real-world scenarios.
