# [One-Step Image Translation with Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing conditional diffusion models for image generation face two key limitations: (1) Slow inference speed due to the iterative sampling process. (2) Reliance on large paired datasets for model training. These issues limit their applicability for real-time applications and settings where paired data is unavailable.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a general framework to adapt an off-the-shelf single-step text-conditional diffusion model to new tasks and domains using adversarial learning objectives. The key ideas are:

(1) Consolidate the separate encoder, UNet and decoder modules of the base model into an end-to-end network with a small number of trainable parameters. This enhances structure preservation while reducing overfitting.

(2) Feed the conditioning input directly to the noise encoder branch of the UNet instead of using separate encoder branches. This avoids conflicting guidance from the noise map and input image.

(3) Add skip connections between encoder and decoder using zero-conv layers to retain high-frequency details from the input image.

The same architecture works for both unpaired (e.g. day-to-night translation) and paired (e.g. sketch-to-image) settings. For unpaired learning, they use a CycleGAN formulation with cycle consistency and adversarial losses.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to achieve one-step image translation using a text-to-image diffusion model backbone.

- Outperforms prior GAN and diffusion baselines on unpaired translation across tasks like day-night, clear-foggy conversion. Qualitative and human studies demonstrate improved realism and structure preservation.

- Comparable performance to recent conditional diffusion models on paired sketch/edge to image tasks, while requiring only a single sampling step during inference rather than 100 steps.

- Extensive ablation studies validate the design choices and demonstrates applicability even with small paired/unpaired datasets.

In summary, the work suggests single-step conditional diffusion models can serve as effective backbones for various downstream image translation objectives while enabling real-time inference.
