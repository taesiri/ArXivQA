# [A Computer Vision Based Approach for Stalking Detection Using a   CNN-LSTM-MLP Hybrid Fusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the important but under-explored problem of physical stalking detection. Stalking is the harassment or monitoring of a victim by observing, following, or spying on them. It is a common precursor to more serious crimes like assault or rape. Despite advances in technology, physical stalking detection has received little attention compared to other issues. Women are disproportionately affected by stalking in public places. There is a need for computer vision and AI methods to automatically detect stalking behaviors to prevent further crimes.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel deep learning-based hybrid fusion model to detect stalking from videos. The key idea is to extract multiple spatial and temporal features from videos and fuse them to accurately classify stalking behaviors. These features include:

- Facial landmarks (eye corners, nose tip etc.) 
- Head pose angles (yaw, pitch)
- Relative distance between stalker and victim
- Spatio-temporal features from CNN + LSTM models

The facial landmarks and angles are fed into a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to output a feature vector. The video frames are input to a Convolutional LSTM model to extract spatio-temporal features. Finally, the outputs of the MLP and ConvLSTM streams are fused and classified to detect stalking or not.

Main Contributions:

- A computer vision solution using CNN, LSTM and MLP fusion to identify stalking from short video clips with minimal frames 

- Inclusion of facial landmarks, angles and distance as crucial features along with CNN-LSTM for improved accuracy

- Introduction of a new stalking video dataset from movies for evaluation

- Achieves 89.58% test accuracy in stalking detection outperforming state-of-the-art methods

- Ability to detect stalking from single short appearances rather than relying on multiple sightings of individuals

The proposed hybrid fusion model provides an efficient way to detect the important problem of physical stalking. By fusing spatial facial features and temporal video features, it can accurately classify stalking behaviors for prevention of further crimes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning-based hybrid fusion model combining CNN, LSTM, and MLP that utilizes facial landmarks, head pose angles, relative distance, and numerical image frames to detect potential stalking scenarios from videos with minimal frames.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a computer vision-based solution using deep learning techniques like CNN, LSTM, and MLP to detect stalking scenarios and classify stalking and non-stalking videos with minimal frames. 

2. They demonstrate how incorporating facial landmarks, head pose angles, and relative distance as features can improve activity recognition performance when facial movements are important.

3. They present a new video dataset of stalking and non-stalking videos gathered from movies and TV shows, which is used to train and evaluate the model.

4. Experimental results on this new dataset show that their proposed method can distinguish stalking and non-stalking behaviors from single-appearance videos with few frames, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. The model achieves 89.58% testing accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is a deep learning-based computer vision solution to detect stalking activities from minimal video frames, along with a new dataset to facilitate research in this area. The inclusion of facial features also improves model performance significantly.
