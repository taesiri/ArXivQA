# [Novel Class Discovery for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11610)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses of this paper are:

- How to tackle the new problem of novel class discovery (NCD) for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation? The paper hypothesizes that adapting existing 2D NCD methods to 3D data is non-trivial and proposes a new method tailored for point clouds.

- Can an online clustering approach be used for NCD on point clouds to handle multiple novel classes per scene? The paper hypothesizes that batch-level online clustering can be more effective than offline clustering of the full dataset. 

- Can pseudo-label uncertainty be exploited to improve prototype learning and overall segmentation quality? The paper hypothesizes that using uncertainty to filter pseudo-labels can improve results.

- What is an appropriate evaluation protocol to benchmark NCD methods on point cloud segmentation? The paper proposes a new protocol with multiple data splits to systematically evaluate performance.

In summary, the main research questions focus on formulating the new task of NCD for 3D point clouds, developing a customized method for this problem, and introducing a suitable benchmark for evaluation. The core hypothesis is that the proposed approach, NOPS, will outperform a baseline adaptation of prior 2D NCD techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It addresses the new problem of novel class discovery (NCD) for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. Prior work on NCD has focused on 2D image data. 

- It shows that directly adapting the only existing NCD method for 2D semantic segmentation (EUMS) to 3D data is suboptimal. The assumptions made in EUMS for 2D images do not hold for 3D point clouds.

- It presents a new method called NOPS for NCD in 3D point clouds based on online clustering and uncertainty estimation. Key aspects include:

  - Online pseudo-labeling via optimal transport
  - Class-balanced queuing to handle missing classes
  - Uncertainty-aware training and queuing
  - Consistency between two augmented views

- It introduces a new evaluation protocol to assess NCD performance for 3D semantic segmentation.

- It demonstrates through experiments on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS that NOPS significantly outperforms the EUMS adaptation baseline for 3D point clouds.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel framework tailored for the new task of NCD in 3D point cloud segmentation, overcoming limitations of adapting prior 2D image methods. The paper advances the state of the art in point cloud analysis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new method called NOPS for discovering and segmenting novel object classes in 3D point clouds by clustering unlabelled points with similar features and exploiting knowledge from labelled base classes, without needing any labels for the novel classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper explores the novel problem of novel class discovery for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. It makes several key contributions:

- It tackles a new problem not previously studied for 3D point clouds. Prior work on novel class discovery has focused on 2D image data. Extending these methods to 3D is non-trivial due to differences like lack of foreground/background distinction and potential for multiple novel classes per scene.

- The paper adapts the only existing method for novel class discovery in 2D semantic segmentation (EUMS) to 3D point clouds as a baseline. Experiments show this baseline has limitations, motivating the need for a new approach designed for 3D data.

- The proposed NOPS method is tailored to point clouds, using online clustering with uncertainty modeling to handle multiple novel classes per scene. A class-balanced queuing strategy also helps deal with variable novel class frequencies across scenes. 

- The paper introduces a new evaluation protocol for assessing novel class discovery in point cloud segmentation, enabling standardized comparison. Results on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS show NOPS substantially outperforms the EUMS baseline.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into the contribution of different components of the NOPS method. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations demonstrate the improved segmentation of novel classes compared to the baseline.

Overall, this paper breaks new ground in studying the novel class discovery problem for 3D point cloud segmentation. The limitations of directly adapting prior 2D methods motivates the development of NOPS, a tailored approach demonstrating sizable improvements over the adapted baseline. The new evaluation protocol is also an important contribution for benchmarking future methods. This helps advance the state of the art in 3D point cloud analysis and novel class discovery.
