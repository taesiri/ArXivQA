# [Novel Class Discovery for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11610)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses of this paper are:

- How to tackle the new problem of novel class discovery (NCD) for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation? The paper hypothesizes that adapting existing 2D NCD methods to 3D data is non-trivial and proposes a new method tailored for point clouds.

- Can an online clustering approach be used for NCD on point clouds to handle multiple novel classes per scene? The paper hypothesizes that batch-level online clustering can be more effective than offline clustering of the full dataset. 

- Can pseudo-label uncertainty be exploited to improve prototype learning and overall segmentation quality? The paper hypothesizes that using uncertainty to filter pseudo-labels can improve results.

- What is an appropriate evaluation protocol to benchmark NCD methods on point cloud segmentation? The paper proposes a new protocol with multiple data splits to systematically evaluate performance.

In summary, the main research questions focus on formulating the new task of NCD for 3D point clouds, developing a customized method for this problem, and introducing a suitable benchmark for evaluation. The core hypothesis is that the proposed approach, NOPS, will outperform a baseline adaptation of prior 2D NCD techniques.
