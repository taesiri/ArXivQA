# [Counterfactual Fairness through Transforming Data Orthogonal to Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models can sometimes exhibit biased decision-making, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups. Most prior work on algorithmic fairness focuses on binary sensitive attributes and does not sufficiently address the effects of multivariate, continuous sensitive variables, which are common in real-world applications. For example, in a hiring scenario, socioeconomic status is a complex, multidimensional sensitive variable that can be challenging to isolate or adjust using traditional methods. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a novel data pre-processing algorithm called "Orthogonal to Bias" (OB) that removes the influence of continuous sensitive variables to achieve counterfactual fairness. The key idea is that under the assumption of joint normality, counterfactual fairness can be attained by decorrelating the non-sensitive variables from the sensitive variables.

The OB algorithm transforms the non-sensitive data matrix to be orthogonal to the sensitive data matrix while minimizing changes to the original data. This results in the counterfactual fairness property that decisions would remain unchanged irrespective of changes to sensitive variables. A sparse variant called SOB is also proposed to improve numerical stability.

The algorithm is model-agnostic and can work with different ML models and tasks. It aims to balance fairness and accuracy by removing just enough information related to sensitive variables.

Main Contributions:

1) Proves that counterfactual fairness can be achieved by ensuring data orthogonality to sensitive variables under joint normality assumption

2) Introduces the OB algorithm to minimally preprocess data for counterfactual fairness across ML models 

3) Validates improved fairness over state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real-world datasets (Adult, COMPAS) without compromising much accuracy

In summary, this paper makes important strides in addressing multivariate, continuous sensitive variables for counterfactual fairness by using a data preprocessing approach. The proposed OB algorithm is flexible, achieves better balance between fairness and accuracy than prior arts, and can enable fairer outcomes in practical ML applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel data pre-processing algorithm, Orthogonal to Bias (OB), that removes the influence of continuous sensitive variables to achieve counterfactual fairness across machine learning models by ensuring the data is uncorrelated with the sensitive variables.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel data pre-processing algorithm called "Orthogonal to Bias" (OB) that facilitates counterfactual fairness in machine learning models. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that counterfactual fairness can be achieved by ensuring the non-sensitive features are uncorrelated with the sensitive features, under the assumption they follow a joint normal distribution. 

2) Based on this insight, the OB algorithm is introduced, which transforms the non-sensitive data to be orthogonal (uncorrelated) to the sensitive data with minimal changes. This allows removing the influence of sensitive variables while retaining as much information as possible.

3) The OB algorithm is model-agnostic, meaning it can work with many different ML models and tasks downstream. It also has a sparse variant called SOB to improve numerical stability.

4) Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that models trained on OB-transformed data can achieve fairer outcomes without substantially compromising accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art fair learning methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a practical data pre-processing technique to enable counterfactual fairness across a variety of machine learning applications, with strong empirical performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper assumes a jointly normal distribution within an SCM framework. How might the performance of the OB algorithm be impacted if this assumption does not hold? Can you think of ways to test or adapt the algorithm for non-normal distributions?

2. The OB algorithm aims to find a closest rank-k matrix approximation to the original data matrix that satisfies an orthogonal constraint. How is the choice of k value likely to impact the performance of the algorithm? What strategies could be used to select an appropriate k value? 

3. The paper introduces a sparse variant of OB called SOB. What is the motivation behind using an L1 penalty in the SOB formulation? In what types of scenarios might SOB offer advantages over the basic OB algorithm?

4. How does the OB algorithm balance counterfactual fairness and accuracy? What causes it to outperform other methods like FL and FLAP on this tradeoff in certain experiments? Can you think of ways to further optimize this balance?

5. The experiments involve both categorical and continuous sensitive variables. Do you expect OB to perform differently across these types? Why or why not? How might performance depend on the number of categories or distribution of the sensitive variables?

6. Could the OB procedure potentially remove non-sensitive information that is useful for prediction? If so, how might this impact the accuracy and fairness tradeoff? Are there ways to safeguard against this possibility?

7. The paper evaluates counterfactual fairness using metrics like CF-metrics and CF Bound. What are the strengths and limitations of these metrics? Can you propose additional or alternative metrics for evaluating counterfactual fairness?

8. How does the performance of OB change across the different datasets tested? What factors might contribute to it performing better or worse on certain data? How could the algorithm's robustness be improved?

9. The OB algorithm is model-agnostic. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this model-agnostic approach compared to other in-processing algorithms that are model-specific?

10. The paper assumes access to the true sensitive attributes. How would performance be impacted if the sensitive attributes were not directly observed and needed to be inferred? What adaptations might allow the use of OB in such settings?
