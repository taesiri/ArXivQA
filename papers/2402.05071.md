# [Extending the Reach of First-Order Algorithms for Nonconvex Min-Max   Problems with Cohypomonotonicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05071)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on solving nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems of the form:

\begin{align*} 
\min_{u\in \mathcal{U}} \max_{v \in \mathcal{V}} f(u,v)
\end{align*}

where $f$ is a smooth function and $\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}$ are closed convex sets. Solving these problems is challenging and prior algorithms are limited to a certain level of nonconvexity/nonconcavity as measured by a parameter $\rho$. Specifically, most existing methods can only handle $\rho < \frac{1}{2L}$ where $L$ is the smoothness parameter of $f$. 

Main Contributions:

1) The paper develops an improved analysis showing that Halpern iteration and Krasnoselskiiâ€“Mann (KM) iteration can handle problems with higher nonconvexity, up to $\rho < \frac{1}{L}$, while still maintaining the optimal or best-known complexity bounds. 

2) The key insight enabling this improvement is utilizing the notion of "conic nonexpansiveness" and "star conic nonexpansiveness" when analyzing convergence. This helps exploit special properties of the resolvent operator even when the problem is nonmonotone.

3) As a byproduct, the analysis leads to several other results including:
- Tighter analysis of inexact Halpern iteration
- Faster rates for stochastic nonconvex-nonconcave problems under certain conditions
- Incorporation of multilevel Monte Carlo into KM iteration

Overall, the paper expands the range of nonconvexity that can be handled by first-order methods, while retaining optimal complexity bounds. The analysis techniques are innovative in exploiting conic nonexpansiveness properties in the nonmonotone setting.
