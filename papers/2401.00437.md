# [BatchEval: Towards Human-like Text Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current LLM-based text evaluators suffer from issues of sensitivity to prompt design, poor robustness to noise, and inferior ensemble performance. These stem from their sole reliance on the criterion prompt as reference for scoring, unlike human evaluators who leverage both criterion and sample comparison.

Method - BatchEval:
The paper proposes BatchEval, an iterative batch-wise text evaluation paradigm. Key ideas:

1) Evaluates samples batched together to introduce in-batch comparison as additional reference alongside criterion. Allows more discriminative scoring.  

2) Iteratively changes batch composition to provide diverse references across rounds. Enhances ensemble diversity.

3) Explores variants - two stage procedure to first analyze then score works best. Heterogeneous batches outperform homogeneous/random. Decimal scoring captures nuances.

Contributions:  

1) Identifies limitations of existing LLM evaluators relative to human evaluators, theoretically and empirically.

2) Proposes BatchEval paradigm to alleviate said limitations. Shows 10.5% correlation gain over prior art on 4 text tasks while using only 64% of the API cost.

3) Validates improved robustness to prompt design/noise and analyzes workings of BatchEval via attention visualization. 

4) Explores variants to discover optimal settings - two stage procedure with heterogeneous batches and decimal scoring works best.

In summary, the paper introduces BatchEval, an iterative batch-wise evaluation paradigm that simulates human evaluation more closely and achieves significantly improved consistency, robustness and cost-efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes BatchEval, a new automatic text evaluation paradigm that iteratively evaluates samples in batches rather than individually to enhance accuracy, robustness, and consistency with human judgments by leveraging in-batch sample comparison as an extra reference alongside the evaluation criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper analyzes limitations of current LLM-based text evaluators, including sensitivity to prompt design, poor robustness to noise, and inferior ensemble performance. 

2. The paper proposes BatchEval, a new paradigm that evaluates texts in batches rather than individually. BatchEval treats in-batch samples and criteria as complementary references and optimizes batch composition through iteration to enhance evaluation accuracy and robustness.

3. The paper validates through experiments on 4 text evaluation tasks that BatchEval outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of correlation with humans while using less API costs. BatchEval is also shown to be more robust and generalizable.

4. The paper analyzes the working mechanism of BatchEval through attention visualization and provides insights into how in-batch comparison benefits the evaluation process.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating BatchEval, a new batch-wise text evaluation paradigm that can enhance performance, robustness and efficiency for LLM-based evaluators. The analyses on working mechanism and optimal configurations also provide useful insights.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- BatchEval - The proposed text evaluation paradigm that evaluates samples in batches rather than individually.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Models like GPT-3 that are used as text evaluators.

- Sample-wise evaluation - The current paradigm used by LLM evaluators that scores texts individually.

- In-batch comparison - Comparing samples within a batch to provide additional scoring references beyond just the evaluation criteria. 

- Iterative batch composition - Strategies like quality-heterogeneous batches that change the batch makeup over iterations.

- Robustness - Testing the stability of the approach, such as to prompt variation and noise.

- Consistency with humans - Measuring correlation of automatic scores with human judgments. 

- Diversity - In the context of ensemble scoring, having varied scores from different evaluations of the same sample.

- Cost - API usage expenses. Key goal is improving performance while reducing costs.

So in summary, key terms cover the proposed BatchEval approach, weaknesses of current methods, evaluation metrics, and analysis around robustness, consistency, diversity and cost.
