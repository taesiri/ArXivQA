# [Media Bias Matters: Understanding the Impact of Politically Biased News   on Vaccine Attitudes in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Politically biased news (PBN) about COVID-19 vaccines has undermined public trust and exacerbated polarized opinions. 
- Little research has focused on (1) connecting news media data with associated social media data, and (2) understanding the causal relationship between exposure to PBN and changes in people's vaccine stance.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a dataset called CovNS that bridges COVID-related PBN and corresponding social media discussions. 
- Categorize Twitter users into pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant groups based on stance stability. 
- Compare PBN consumption and social media discussion patterns across the three groups.
- Formulate causal graphs and apply state-of-the-art causal learning models to estimate the causal effect of PBN exposure on users' vaccine stance changes.

Main Contributions:
- Curate the CovNS dataset that connects COVID-related politically biased news with associated social media data.
- Characterize differences in PBN consumption preference and social media discussion topics across pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant Twitter user groups. 
- Employ advanced causal inference techniques to estimate the causal effect of PBN exposure on users' COVID-19 vaccine stance changes, revealing vaccine-hesitant users are more vulnerable to PBN influence.

In summary, the paper collects an integrated biased news media and social media dataset, analyzes user behavior differences across vaccine stance groups, and leverages causal learning models to assess the impact of biased news exposure on users' vaccine attitudes. Key findings are that left-leaning and right-leaning news cause stance shifts towards pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine respectively, with vaccine-hesitant users being disproportionately influenced.
