# [Policy Learning for Off-Dynamics RL with Deficient Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10765)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively learn complex policies but often requires extensive interactions with the environment, which may be infeasible in real-world scenarios due to costs or safety concerns. A common approach is to train a policy in a simulated source environment (e.g. simulator) and transfer it to the real-world target environment. However, simulators cannot perfectly replicate real-world dynamics, leading to discrepancies between source and target environments. Past works assume the source domain fully covers all possible target transitions (full support), but this assumption rarely holds, leading to deficient support. Addressing policy learning under deficient support is an open problem.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a method called DADS to address off-dynamics RL with deficient support without needing detailed domain knowledge or full support. It creates a modified source domain with minimum deficiency wrt the target via two key operations:

1) Skewing: Learns to skew source transitions towards target transitions by solving an optimization problem. This enables sampling source transitions more aligned with the target.

2) Extension: Uses MixUp to create synthetic transitions between skewed source and target transitions. This expands source support towards target support, filling uncovered areas.

The skewed and mixup transitions are combined to form the modified source domain. Rewards are adjusted to account for remaining dynamics discrepancy between modified source and target. The modified transitions are used to learn the target policy with standard RL.

Main Contributions:
- First work addressing off-dynamics RL under deficient support between source and target environments.
- Theoretical analysis providing insights into tackling deficient support for effective policy learning.  
- DADS algorithm which modifies source domain to minimize deficiency via skewing and extension operations.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over previous methods by effectively handling dynamics discrepancies and expanding source support towards target.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights and an effective practical solution for tackling policy learning under limited environment interactions and significant dynamics mismatch between domains, which is highly relevant for real-world applications of RL.
