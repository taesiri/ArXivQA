# [Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves   Equivariant Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting quantum mechanical properties like forces and energy of atomistic systems is important but requires expensive computations. 
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have made progress on this but suffer from limited data compared to domains like computer vision and NLP.
- Self-supervised learning methods like denoising have helped in CV/NLP but don't directly apply here as denoising non-equilibrium structures is ill-posed due to multiple possible target structures.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) by encoding forces of original structures to make the target structure unique.
- Add noise to 3D coordinates of atoms and predict the noise vectors while conditioning on original forces.
- Use DeNS as auxiliary task along with main tasks like energy and force prediction.
- DeNS favors equivariant networks which can easily incorporate forces in node embeddings.

Key Ideas:
- Encoding forces constraints positions of non-equilibrium structures and makes denoising well-defined. 
- DeNS enables better use of non-equilibrium data which is much more available than equilibrium data.
- Marginal increase in training time but significant gains in performance.
- Applicable to multiple equivariant architectures.

Contributions:
- Formulation of DeNS for denoising non-equilibrium atomic structures. 
- State-of-the-art results on OC20, OC22 datasets and improved performance on MD17 dataset.
- Demonstration that DeNS improves sample efficiency of training equivariant networks.
- Detailed analysis and ablation studies on design choices and hyperparameters.
