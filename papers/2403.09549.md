# [Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves   Equivariant Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting quantum mechanical properties like forces and energy of atomistic systems is important but requires expensive computations. 
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have made progress on this but suffer from limited data compared to domains like computer vision and NLP.
- Self-supervised learning methods like denoising have helped in CV/NLP but don't directly apply here as denoising non-equilibrium structures is ill-posed due to multiple possible target structures.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) by encoding forces of original structures to make the target structure unique.
- Add noise to 3D coordinates of atoms and predict the noise vectors while conditioning on original forces.
- Use DeNS as auxiliary task along with main tasks like energy and force prediction.
- DeNS favors equivariant networks which can easily incorporate forces in node embeddings.

Key Ideas:
- Encoding forces constraints positions of non-equilibrium structures and makes denoising well-defined. 
- DeNS enables better use of non-equilibrium data which is much more available than equilibrium data.
- Marginal increase in training time but significant gains in performance.
- Applicable to multiple equivariant architectures.

Contributions:
- Formulation of DeNS for denoising non-equilibrium atomic structures. 
- State-of-the-art results on OC20, OC22 datasets and improved performance on MD17 dataset.
- Demonstration that DeNS improves sample efficiency of training equivariant networks.
- Detailed analysis and ablation studies on design choices and hyperparameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called DeNS that leverages denoising non-equilibrium structures as an auxiliary task for training equivariant graph neural networks to better predict energies and forces in atomistic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on OC20, OC22, and MD17 datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "Denoising Non-Equilibrium Structures (DeNS)" to improve the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on predicting properties like energy and forces for 3D atomistic systems. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Generalizing the idea of denoising structures to non-equilibrium structures, which are much more abundant than equilibrium ones. This is done by encoding the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure when corrupting and reconstructing it to make the denoising process well-posed.

2) Using DeNS as an auxiliary task during training along with the main tasks of predicting energy and forces. This improves sample efficiency and performance with minimal overhead.

3) Demonstrating that DeNS is particularly suited for equivariant GNNs since they can easily incorporate forces in their embeddings. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on OC20, OC22 and improved performance on MD17 by using DeNS with Equiformer networks.

4) Analysis showing that DeNS helps by providing implicit data augmentation and enabling the model to learn correlated objectives related to structure-property relationships.

In summary, the key contribution is successfully adapting the idea of denoising to atomistic modeling by using forces to enable generalization to abundant non-equilibrium data and showing its effectiveness to improve state-of-the-art equivariant GNNs.

The paper proposes using denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to improve GNN performance on tasks like predicting energies and forces of atomistic systems. A key aspect is encoding forces when denoising to make reconstructing non-equilibrium structures well-posed. The method is shown to boost the performance of equivariant networks like EquiformerV2, which can easily incorporate forces in node embeddings. Experiments demonstrate improved performance on OC20, OC22, and MD17 datasets with minimal overhead. So the core ideas relate to denoising, GNNs, equivariance, force encoding, and using denoising as an auxiliary self-supervised task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does encoding forces help make the denoising of non-equilibrium structures well-posed? Why is denoising non-equilibrium structures without force encoding ill-posed?

2. The paper mentions that denoising non-equilibrium structures enables learning the interaction of transforming forces into structures. Can you expand more on what this means and why it is useful? 

3. Why does the proposed method favor equivariant networks over invariant networks? What specifically makes equivariant networks a more natural fit for incorporating forces and higher-order tensors into node embeddings?

4. How does training with denoising non-equilibrium structures achieve better data augmentation compared to only denoising equilibrium structures? What new 3D geometries can be generated?

5. What are the key differences in mathematical formulation between denoising equilibrium structures versus non-equilibrium structures? How does the proposed method generalize previous formulations?

6. What are the practical benefits of using denoising non-equilibrium structures as an auxiliary task rather than a pre-training task? What implications does this have for releasing and leveraging atomistic datasets?

7. The method uses multi-scale noise - what is the intuition behind this? How does sampling from a distribution of noise scales differ from using a fixed noise level?

8. Why is denoising partially corrupted structures better than fully corrupted structures on some datasets? When would you expect one to outperform the other?  

9. How much overhead does the proposed training procedure introduce over baseline training? Is the performance improvement worth the extra complexity?

10. Can you compare and contrast the proposed self-supervised learning method with analogous methods from computer vision and NLP? What adaptations were necessary to make denoising effective for atomistic modeling?
