## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Skeleton-in-Context (SiC), a novel framework for handling multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously via in-context learning. SiC employs two types of prompts - task-guided prompts and task-unified prompts, to facilitate context perception from the desired task. The task-guided prompt provides an example input-target pair to demonstrate the task, while the task-unified prompt encodes common patterns across tasks as a prior. At training time, SiC is trained end-to-end on multiple datasets covering tasks like motion prediction, pose estimation, joint completion, and future pose estimation. At test time, SiC can accomplish different tasks based on the prompt provided, without any task-specific modules or fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in multi-tasking capability. SiC even outperforms specialized single-task models on certain tasks. Moreover, SiC generalizes well to unseen datasets and can perform new tasks like motion in-between based on customized prompts. The unified modeling via in-context learning provides flexibility and strong generalization ability for skeleton-based understanding.
