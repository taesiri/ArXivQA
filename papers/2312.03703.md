# [Skeleton-in-Context: Unified Skeleton Sequence Modeling with In-Context   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03703)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Skeleton-in-Context (SiC), a novel framework for handling multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously via in-context learning. SiC employs two types of prompts - task-guided prompts and task-unified prompts, to facilitate context perception from the desired task. The task-guided prompt provides an example input-target pair to demonstrate the task, while the task-unified prompt encodes common patterns across tasks as a prior. At training time, SiC is trained end-to-end on multiple datasets covering tasks like motion prediction, pose estimation, joint completion, and future pose estimation. At test time, SiC can accomplish different tasks based on the prompt provided, without any task-specific modules or fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in multi-tasking capability. SiC even outperforms specialized single-task models on certain tasks. Moreover, SiC generalizes well to unseen datasets and can perform new tasks like motion in-between based on customized prompts. The unified modeling via in-context learning provides flexibility and strong generalization ability for skeleton-based understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Skeleton-in-Context (SiC), a novel framework for end-to-end multi-task modeling of skeleton sequences using in-context learning, which leverages task-guided and task-unified prompts to guide the model to accomplish diverse tasks from a single training process without any task-specific designs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes Skeleton-in-Context (SiC), a novel framework for skeleton sequence modeling, which can handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a single training process without any task-specific designs. The model perceives tasks from context (prompts) and accomplishes the task accordingly.

2) It establishes a new 3D human in-context learning benchmark comprised of multiple skeleton-based tasks such as motion prediction, pose estimation, joint completion, and future motion estimation. It also benchmarks several representative in-context learning baselines.

3) It conducts extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed SiC framework. SiC achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-tasking and even outperforms some task-specific models. It also shows good generalization capability to unseen tasks like motion in-between.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective in-context learning framework SiC for multi-task skeleton sequence modeling, along with a new benchmark and comprehensive evaluations demonstrating its capabilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Skeleton-in-Context (SiC): The proposed framework for skeleton sequence modeling that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously via in-context learning after a single training process.

- In-context learning: The paradigm where models perceive tasks from input-output examples (prompts) and accomplish tasks accordingly, without task-specific heads or fine-tuning. Enables multi-task capability and generalization.

- Skeleton sequence: Sequential 3D pose data representing human motions over time. SiC operates on such data. 

- Task-guided prompt (TGP): An input-output skeleton sequence example that instructs the model on what task to perform. Provides task context.

- Task-unified prompt (TUP): An adaptive module that facilitates learning across diverse tasks and datasets. Two versions proposed - static and dynamic.

- Negative transfer: The phenomenon in multi-task learning where different datasets/tasks confuse the model leading to decreased performance. SiC's prompts address this.

- Multi-task synergistic training: SiC's ability to enable collaborative training of multiple tasks in a unified framework via prompts. Achieves superior overall performance.

- Generalization capability: SiC's ability to generalize to unseen datasets and accomplish unseen tasks according to customized prompts.

In summary, the key ideas focus around using prompts for in-context multi-task learning on skeleton sequences, overcoming negative transfer, and achieving generalization.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for skeleton-based human motion modeling rely on task-specific architectures and non-end-to-end frameworks. This limits their capability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a flexible way.
- Directly applying existing in-context learning models from other areas to skeleton sequences fails due to the spatio-temporal complexity and high inter-pose similarity, making it difficult to perceive the correct task from context.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Skeleton-in-Context (SiC), a novel framework for end-to-end multi-task skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning. 
- SiC employs two types of prompts:
   - Task-Guided Prompt (TGP): Provides an example input-target pair to guide the model on what task to perform.
   - Task-Unified Prompt (TUP): Encodes common patterns across tasks as a prior to help distinguish tasks. Implemented in two versions - static and dynamic.
- The model architecture comprises spatial and temporal transformers in an alternating fashion to capture motion characteristics.

Key Contributions:
- First work to introduce in-context learning for skeleton sequence modeling and multi-tasking.
- Proposes tailored prompts - TGP and TUP to facilitate context perception for skeleton sequences.
- Establishes a new multi-task benchmark with diverse skeleton-based tasks like motion prediction, pose estimation, joint completion and future pose estimation.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-task settings, outperforming prior specialized models in certain tasks. Demonstrates generalization ability to unseen tasks and datasets.

In summary, the paper pioneers a flexible end-to-end approach via in-context learning to unify multiple skeleton-based tasks within a single framework, overcoming limitations of prior specialized models. The introduced prompts and benchmarks set strong baselines for further research in this direction.
