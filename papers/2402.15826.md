# [Reward Design for Justifiable Sequential Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of designing reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents that incentivize the agents to not only carry out a given task, but also justify the decisions they make with supporting evidence. This is important for accountable and transparent decision-making, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare. However, specifying rewards that achieve this is difficult.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using a debate-based reward model to quantify the justifiability of an RL agent's decisions. In this model, the reward comes from a two-player zero-sum debate game between argumentative agents. One agent argues for the RL agent's decision using supporting evidence, while the other argues for an alternative decision. A proxy of a human judge then evaluates which decision was better justified based on the evidence presented. The outcome of this debate game is used to shape the rewards for the RL agent, called the "justifiable" agent.

Specifically, the justifiable agent's actions are compared to a baseline agent's actions. If the judge prefers the justifiable agent's action based on the debate, a positive reward is given. This incentivizes the justifiable agent to take not only good decisions for the task, but also ones that are more easily justified.

The key components enabling this framework are: (1) a proxy judge model trained on human preferences to evaluate decisions; (2) contextualized argumentative agents that can argue different instances of the debate game; (3) mixing the debate reward with the environment reward to optimize policy performance and justifiability.

Contributions:
The main contributions are:

(i) Formalizing the problem of justifiable sequential decision-making and using debate games to model the justifiability reward.

(ii) Providing a method to learn a proxy judge from human preferences that can evaluate decisions using limited evidence.

(iii) An approach to learn contextualized argumentative agents that can solve debate game instances.

(iv) Demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in learning policies for treating sepsis patients that are preferred by the judge over a baseline, with limited performance loss. Also testing properties like robustness of argumentative agents.

In summary, the paper makes a novel connection between debate games and interpretable reward design for RL, enabled through key algorithmic components. It shows promising results on a healthcare task, substantiating the framework's practical promise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using a debate-based reward model in reinforcement learning to train policies that make decisions that are more easily justifiable with supporting evidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of a debate-based reward model for reinforcement learning agents to incentivize justifiable sequential decision-making. Specifically:

(i) They formalize the problem of justifiable decision-making by modeling debate as an extensive-form game where two argumentative agents take turns providing evidence to support competing decisions. The outcome of this debate game quantifies the justifiability of a decision. 

(ii) They provide a method for learning a proxy judge model from human preferences that can evaluate a decision's justifiability using only the proposed evidence. 

(iii) They propose an approach for learning contextualized argumentative strategies that solve the debate game. 

(iv) They demonstrate the potential of their approach on a real-world problem of treating sepsis patients. The debate-based rewards yield policies highly favored by the judge while hardly sacrificing performance. The debate-based feedback is comparable to state-based feedback from an ideal judge in terms of policy performance and alignment.

(v) They analyze properties of the trained argumentative agents, showing they learn to provide evidence that aligns with human preferences and is resilient to refutations.

The paper focuses on designing debate-based reward models to train reinforcement learning agents that can make justifiable sequential decisions. Key ideas include using a zero-sum debate game between argumentative agents to quantify the justifiability of a decision, having a judge evaluate the proposed evidence to determine the debate reward, and using this signal to optimize policies that are both high-performing and produce decisions that can be easily justified with supporting evidence. The method is demonstrated on a sepsis treatment task, where argumentative agents take turns proposing evidence to justify competing treatment decisions to a proxy of a human judge. Overall, the key terms revolve around using debate games and argumentation to make reinforcement learning policies more transparent, interpretable, and accountable.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a debate-based reward model to train a justifiable policy. Can you explain in more detail how the debate game is set up between the two argumentative agents? What is the exact mechanism by which the debate outcome translates into a reward signal?

2. The judge model plays a critical role in evaluating the justifiability of decisions based on proposed evidence. Can you elaborate on how the judge model is trained? What loss function is optimized and what are some key architectural choices made? 

3. The paper argues that good supporting evidence should be convincing, concise and robust to counterarguments. How does the proposed debate-based framework achieve these three desired properties? What specific mechanisms encourage the emergence of such evidence?

4. When learning the argumentative agents, two optimization strategies are mentioned: self-play and maxmin. Can you explain the difference between these two approaches? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages? 

5. The experimental section compares the proposed method against a state-based judge that has full visibility into the state when evaluating decisions. What are the key findings from this comparison and what do they suggest about the utility of debate for quantifying justifiability?

6. How exactly is the preference dataset constructed in the sepsis treatment experiments? What strategies are used to define the ground truth preference and what are their trade-offs?

7. One could argue that debate requires a well-defined evidence/argument space. What are some ways the evidence could be defined in different domains like healthcare, text generation or human-AI collaboration? What are the challenges?

8. The results show a trade-off between task performance and debate-based justifiability. What are some ways this trade-off could be handled when deploying such an agent in practice?

9. The paper focuses on a specific definition of the debate game utility function. How robust are the results to alternative definitions? Are there any utility functions you think could work better?

10. The proposed framework relies heavily on human judgment for training the judge model and evaluating debate outcomes. What are some limitations or biases that could emerge from such reliance on human feedback?
