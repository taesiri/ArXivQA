# [Expert-guided Bayesian Optimisation for Human-in-the-loop Experimental   Design of Known Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Bayesian optimization is an effective method for optimizing expensive black-box functions. However, it does not incorporate any domain knowledge from experts who often have valuable insights about the system being optimized. Existing methods that integrate expert knowledge have limitations - they rely on experts defining a prior that needs updating throughout, only influence certain regions rather than specific solutions, or require continuous expert involvement.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new framework to enable experts to directly influence the Bayesian optimization process by selecting optimal experiments in a discrete manner. At each iteration, an augmented multi-objective optimization problem is solved to generate multiple distinct high-utility solutions. The expert then selects one of these alternate solutions to evaluate next.  

The two objectives optimized are: 
1) Sum of utility values of the alternate solutions
2) Determinant of their covariance matrix - represents total variability. 

By taking the knee point of the Pareto front, a set of solutions is obtained that balances high utility and reasonable distinctness.

The expert performs discrete Bayesian reasoning by conditioning the information provided about alternatives (expected outputs, utilities etc.) with their own domain knowledge to pick one for evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- A new method to leverage expert domain knowledge in Bayesian optimization in a discrete human-in-the-loop manner, avoiding issues with continuous involvement or predefined rigid priors.

- Introduction of an augmented multi-objective problem to generate optimal distinct alternatives by balancing utility and diversity objectives.

- Experimental analysis with different simulated user behaviors shows faster convergence and robustness over standard Bayesian optimization.

- Interpretable high-dimensional optimization by allowing experts to select solutions at each iteration.

In summary, the paper enables efficient integration of human domain knowledge into Bayesian optimization through a flexible and interactive framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a methodology for expert-guided batch Bayesian optimization that enables domain experts to influence the selection of optimal experiments by providing them with a set of distinct high-utility alternate solutions at each iteration for evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be a methodology for integrating human domain experts into the Bayesian optimization process for experimental design. Specifically:

- The paper presents an approach to enable experts to influence the selection of experiments by exploiting the hypothesis that humans are better at making discrete choices than continuous ones. 

- At each iteration, an augmented multi-objective optimization problem is solved across a number of alternate solutions, maximizing both the utility function values and the covariance determinant (information gain). 

- The solution at the knee point of the Pareto front is taken, returning a set of alternate solutions with both high utility and reasonable distinctness. 

- The expert then selects one of these options for evaluation, effectively performing discrete Bayesian reasoning by conditioning their prior knowledge with the information provided.

- This allows the expert to guide the optimization, especially in early critical decisions, while still ensuring the alternatives have high information gain. The approach recovers standard BO performance even with an uninformed practitioner.

So in summary, the main contribution is an expert-guided Bayesian optimization framework that leverages human guidance during discrete choice steps while preserving statistical optimality.

The paper presents an approach for expert-guided Bayesian optimization that puts a human expert "in the loop" to influence the selection of experiments. It formulates a multi-objective optimization problem to generate a set of solution alternatives that balance utility and variability. The expert then selects one option to evaluate, leveraging their domain knowledge. Performance is benchmarked in terms of regret compared to standard Bayesian optimization. Key concepts include the Bayesian optimization framework, handling multiple objectives, and quantifying human influence on optimization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an augmented multi-objective optimization problem to generate alternate solutions. What are the objectives being optimized and how do they allow the generation of useful alternate solutions for the expert to choose from?

2. The paper states that by taking the knee point solution of the Pareto front, a set of solutions is obtained that have both high utility values and are reasonably distinct. Explain why both high utility and distinctness of solutions is important.  

3. The paper hypothesizes that humans perform better at discrete choices compared to continuous ones. Elaborate on this hypothesis and explain how the proposed method allows the human expert to leverage this.

4. What are some of the benefits of allowing the human expert to influence decisions in early iterations versus later fine-tuning iterations? Explain with examples from the results.

5. The paper benchmarks several "human behaviors" - expert, adversarial, trusting etc. Compare and contrast the results between two of these behaviors in optimizing the objective functions.  

6. When the expert makes random selections, performance matches standard Bayesian optimization. Explain why this demonstrates the effectiveness of the choices presented to the expert.

7. The paper states the methodology could be interpreted as a high-throughput/batch Bayesian optimization method. Elaborate on the similarities and differences with existing batch Bayesian optimization techniques.

8. The results show improved convergence even when the expert selects the best solution only 25% of the time. Analyze and discuss the trends in simple regret and average regret compared to standard BO in this case.

9. Discuss how the amount of improvement gains from an expert practitioner changes with increasing problem dimensionality based on the results. Provide possible reasons.

10. The paper leaves real human evaluation for future work. What challenges do you foresee in evaluating real human performance and how might the benchmarking approach need to be adapted?
