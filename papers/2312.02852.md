# [Expert-guided Bayesian Optimisation for Human-in-the-loop Experimental   Design of Known Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Bayesian optimization is an effective method for optimizing expensive black-box functions. However, it does not incorporate any domain knowledge from experts who often have valuable insights about the system being optimized. Existing methods that integrate expert knowledge have limitations - they rely on experts defining a prior that needs updating throughout, only influence certain regions rather than specific solutions, or require continuous expert involvement.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new framework to enable experts to directly influence the Bayesian optimization process by selecting optimal experiments in a discrete manner. At each iteration, an augmented multi-objective optimization problem is solved to generate multiple distinct high-utility solutions. The expert then selects one of these alternate solutions to evaluate next.  

The two objectives optimized are: 
1) Sum of utility values of the alternate solutions
2) Determinant of their covariance matrix - represents total variability. 

By taking the knee point of the Pareto front, a set of solutions is obtained that balances high utility and reasonable distinctness.

The expert performs discrete Bayesian reasoning by conditioning the information provided about alternatives (expected outputs, utilities etc.) with their own domain knowledge to pick one for evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- A new method to leverage expert domain knowledge in Bayesian optimization in a discrete human-in-the-loop manner, avoiding issues with continuous involvement or predefined rigid priors.

- Introduction of an augmented multi-objective problem to generate optimal distinct alternatives by balancing utility and diversity objectives.

- Experimental analysis with different simulated user behaviors shows faster convergence and robustness over standard Bayesian optimization.

- Interpretable high-dimensional optimization by allowing experts to select solutions at each iteration.

In summary, the paper enables efficient integration of human domain knowledge into Bayesian optimization through a flexible and interactive framework.
