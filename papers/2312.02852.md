# [Expert-guided Bayesian Optimisation for Human-in-the-loop Experimental   Design of Known Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02852)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method for integrating human domain expertise into Bayesian optimization in order to improve the efficiency of finding optimal solutions. The key idea is to solve a multi-objective optimization problem at each iteration that provides a set of distinct high-utility alternatives to a human expert, who then selects one of them to evaluate next based on their knowledge. Specifically, the objectives being optimized are the total utility of the set of alternatives as well their diversity, measured by the determinant of their covariance matrix. By taking alternatives along the Pareto front and having the expert pick from this set, the goal is to leverage human judgement in early iterations while still ensuring reasonable evaluation candidates. The method is benchmarked on sample functions against standard Bayesian optimization and shows improved convergence when the expert selects good solutions even only some of the time. It provides a framework for discrete human reasoning based on conditioning provided information, without requiring a full continuous prior from the expert. Key intended benefits are better early convergence and interpretability compared to fully automated Bayesian optimization.
