# [Getting the Ball Rolling: Learning a Dexterous Policy for a Biomimetic   Tendon-Driven Hand with Rolling Contact Joints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: Can a dexterous manipulation skill trained in simulation using reinforcement learning be successfully transferred to a physical biomimetic tendon-driven robot hand with rolling contact joints?The key elements of this question are:- Dexterous manipulation skill: The authors focus on an in-hand sphere rotation task as a first step towards humanlike dexterous manipulation. - Trained in simulation using RL: The policy is trained using GPU-accelerated simulations and reinforcement learning.- Transferred to physical robot: A key goal is zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the trained policy.- Biomimetic tendon-driven hand: The Faive Hand has a biomimetic design with tendon-driven fingers.- Rolling contact joints: A key challenge is controlling joints without fixed axes of rotation.So in summary, this paper tests if an RL-trained dexterous manipulation skill can be directly transferred to a physical biomimetic robot hand with a complex tendon-driven rolling contact joint design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the development and demonstration of a biomimetic dexterous robotic hand called the Faive Hand. The key points are:- The Faive Hand uses a novel rolling contact joint design that is 3D printable, robust, and biomimetic. It achieves a 10 kg payload capacity at only 1.1 kg system weight.- The rolling contact joints were modeled in simulation using two virtual hinge joints constrained to move together. This allowed integrating the hand model into the IsaacGym simulator for reinforcement learning.- A proprioceptive policy was trained using A2C to achieve dexterous in-hand sphere rotation. Domain randomization was critical for sim-to-real transfer. - A low-level controller was implemented to enable joint control and state estimation using tendon lengths. An EKF was used to estimate joint angles.- The trained policy achieved zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the dexterous sphere rotation skill on the physical Faive Hand, demonstrating its potential as a platform for dexterous manipulation research.In summary, the key contribution is the development of the hardware/software platform combining the Faive Hand design with simulations and control methods to achieve complex dexterous manipulation skills on a physical robotic hand.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces a tendon-driven biomimetic robot hand with rolling contact joints, models it in simulation to train a reinforcement learning policy for dexterous sphere rotation, and achieves zero-shot transfer of the skill to the physical robot hand.
