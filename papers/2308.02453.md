# [Getting the Ball Rolling: Learning a Dexterous Policy for a Biomimetic   Tendon-Driven Hand with Rolling Contact Joints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: Can a dexterous manipulation skill trained in simulation using reinforcement learning be successfully transferred to a physical biomimetic tendon-driven robot hand with rolling contact joints?The key elements of this question are:- Dexterous manipulation skill: The authors focus on an in-hand sphere rotation task as a first step towards humanlike dexterous manipulation. - Trained in simulation using RL: The policy is trained using GPU-accelerated simulations and reinforcement learning.- Transferred to physical robot: A key goal is zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the trained policy.- Biomimetic tendon-driven hand: The Faive Hand has a biomimetic design with tendon-driven fingers.- Rolling contact joints: A key challenge is controlling joints without fixed axes of rotation.So in summary, this paper tests if an RL-trained dexterous manipulation skill can be directly transferred to a physical biomimetic robot hand with a complex tendon-driven rolling contact joint design.
