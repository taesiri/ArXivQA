# [Getting the Ball Rolling: Learning a Dexterous Policy for a Biomimetic   Tendon-Driven Hand with Rolling Contact Joints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02453)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: 

Can a dexterous manipulation skill trained in simulation using reinforcement learning be successfully transferred to a physical biomimetic tendon-driven robot hand with rolling contact joints?

The key elements of this question are:

- Dexterous manipulation skill: The authors focus on an in-hand sphere rotation task as a first step towards humanlike dexterous manipulation. 

- Trained in simulation using RL: The policy is trained using GPU-accelerated simulations and reinforcement learning.

- Transferred to physical robot: A key goal is zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the trained policy.

- Biomimetic tendon-driven hand: The Faive Hand has a biomimetic design with tendon-driven fingers.

- Rolling contact joints: A key challenge is controlling joints without fixed axes of rotation.

So in summary, this paper tests if an RL-trained dexterous manipulation skill can be directly transferred to a physical biomimetic robot hand with a complex tendon-driven rolling contact joint design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development and demonstration of a biomimetic dexterous robotic hand called the Faive Hand. The key points are:

- The Faive Hand uses a novel rolling contact joint design that is 3D printable, robust, and biomimetic. It achieves a 10 kg payload capacity at only 1.1 kg system weight.

- The rolling contact joints were modeled in simulation using two virtual hinge joints constrained to move together. This allowed integrating the hand model into the IsaacGym simulator for reinforcement learning.

- A proprioceptive policy was trained using A2C to achieve dexterous in-hand sphere rotation. Domain randomization was critical for sim-to-real transfer. 

- A low-level controller was implemented to enable joint control and state estimation using tendon lengths. An EKF was used to estimate joint angles.

- The trained policy achieved zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the dexterous sphere rotation skill on the physical Faive Hand, demonstrating its potential as a platform for dexterous manipulation research.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of the hardware/software platform combining the Faive Hand design with simulations and control methods to achieve complex dexterous manipulation skills on a physical robotic hand.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a tendon-driven biomimetic robot hand with rolling contact joints, models it in simulation to train a reinforcement learning policy for dexterous sphere rotation, and achieves zero-shot transfer of the skill to the physical robot hand.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other recent work in dexterous manipulation using reinforcement learning:

- The paper introduces a new biomimetic tendon-driven robotic hand called the Faive Hand. This hand uses rolling contact joints, which are different from pin joints or machined springs used in other dexterous hands like the Shadow Hand or Allegro Hand. Modeling these joints required some novel techniques in simulation.

- For training the RL policy, the paper uses a GPU-based simulator (IsaacGym) which allows massively parallelized simulation. This aligns with recent trends in using GPU compute for sim-to-real RL, enabling faster training times compared to previous work like OpenAI's 2018 cube rotation which used massively parallelized CPU simulation.

- The paper achieves zero-shot transfer of an in-hand sphere rotation skill trained in simulation onto the physical robot. This builds on other recent work achieving dexterous manipulation sim-to-real transfer, like cube rotation on the Allegro Hand or reorienting objects on the TriFinger.

- The policy uses only proprioceptive observations (joint angles), avoiding the need for vision. Some other recent work has used vision-based policies for dexterous manipulation sim2real. Relying only on proprioception simplifies the sim2real process.

- Domain randomization was critical for achieving good sim-to-real transfer. This aligns with findings in other recent manipulation papers, showing the importance of dynamics randomization for making policies robust to the sim2real gap.

- Compared to some other work, the paper demonstrates a somewhat simpler task (rotating a sphere) rather than more complex object reorientation or cube rotation. But it provides a solid foundation using this new hand platform towards achieving more complex dexterous manipulation in future work.

In summary, the paper aligns with recent trends in using massively parallel GPU simulation and domain randomization for efficient sim2real transfer, while introducing a novel hand design and providing results for in-hand manipulation on real hardware. It provides a baseline for pursuing more complex tasks on this new biomimetic platform.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing additional actuation and sensing capabilities for the Faive Hand to improve its performance in RL sim2real tasks as well as other tasks like behavior cloning. The authors mention that the current prototype lacks abduction/adduction joints which limits dexterity. Improving sensing could help with issues like tendon stretch affecting proprioception.

- Exploring a wider range of dexterous manipulation tasks with the Faive Hand platform using RL training. The paper focused on sphere rotation as an initial proof-of-concept task. Testing on more complex tasks could further validate the platform.

- Improving the sim2real transferrability of policies trained in simulation. The authors found domain randomization was key to getting policies to work on the real robot. More investigation into sim2real techniques could improve performance.

- Reducing the sim2real gap in the first place by improving the accuracy of the simulation model, for example by better modeling friction, contacts, and tendon/ligament mechanics. This could reduce the need for domain randomization.

- Iterating on the mechanical design of the hand and fingers to improve robustness, payload capability, and manufacturability. The current version is a prototype.

- Developing model-based controllers for the hand as an alternative to relying solely on RL. Hybrid approaches could also be promising.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the Faive Hand design itself, expanding the range of tasks demonstrated, and continuing to improve the sim2real transfer of policies trained with RL simulation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces the Faive Hand, a biomimetic tendon-driven robotic hand with rolling contact joints. The authors modeled the rolling contact joints in simulation to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for dexterous in-hand sphere rotation using the IsaacGym simulator. The policy was trained using advantage actor-critic with domain randomization. To run the trained policy on the physical hand, they implemented a mapping between joint angles and tendon lengths and used an extended Kalman filter for proprioceptive sensing. The policy achieved zero-shot transfer of the dexterous rolling skill from simulation to the real robot. The Faive Hand is presented as an accessible and capable platform for exploring dexterous manipulation skills with RL.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a biomimetic tendon-driven robotic hand called the Faive Hand that uses rolling contact joints to achieve a dexterous and robust design. The authors model the rolling contact joints in simulation and develop a control method to enable joint-level sensing and actuation despite not having joint encoders. They use this simulated model to train a reinforcement learning policy for in-hand sphere rotation using the IsaacGym framework and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer by running the policy on the physical robotic hand. Experiments show that the policy trained with domain randomization can consistently rotate the sphere on the physical robot at the target velocity.

The Faive Hand is presented as an accessible open platform for dexterous manipulation research. Compared to other anthropomorphic hands, it uses 3D printed components and servo motors to reduce cost while maintaining a robust and humanlike design through its rolling contact joints. This work shows the hand's integration into a parallelized simulation environment for reinforcement learning, allowing policies to be trained and deployed on the physical robot. The zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the sphere rotation skill demonstrates the potential of using this platform for learning dexterous manipulation policies. Key contributions are the modeling and control methods for the rolling contact joints, the reinforcement learning framework, and the introduction of the Faive Hand prototype.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper introduces the biomimetic tendon-driven Faive Hand and its system architecture, which uses tendon-driven rolling contact joints to achieve a 3D printable, robust high-DOF hand design. The authors model each element of the hand and integrate it into the IsaacGym GPU simulation environment to train a policy with reinforcement learning (RL) for dexterous sphere rotation. They use advantage actor-critic with domain randomization. The actor network takes proprioceptive observations of past joint positions while the critic uses extra privileged information. The trained policy is then run on the physical robot hand using a closed-loop controller that converts joint angle commands to tendon motor commands and estimates joint angles from tendon lengths using an extended Kalman filter. This achieves zero-shot transfer of the dexterous sphere rotation skill to the real robot hand.
