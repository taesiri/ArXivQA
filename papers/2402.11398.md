# [Reasoning before Comparison: LLM-Enhanced Semantic Similarity Metrics   for Domain Specialized Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11398)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional NLP metrics like ROUGE and BLEU have limitations in capturing semantic meaning when analyzing medical texts. They focus on surface-level lexical similarities rather than deeper clinical implications.
- There is a need for more sophisticated analysis of medical texts using the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a framework that uses GPT-4 for zero-shot identification and labeling of radiology reports. 
- Apply this framework on MIMIC-CXR dataset of chest x-ray reports. 
- Have GPT-4 generate labels based solely on its knowledge to categorize reports. Refine labels to match dataset's ground truth labels.
- Convert labels into semantic embeddings using "all-mpnet-base-v2" and compute semantic similarity scores between reports.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrated GPT-4 can accurately discern and label medical texts using zero-shot learning.
- GPT-4 generated labels, when analyzed through semantic embeddings, have higher correlation to ground truth similarities than ROUGE and BLEU scores.
- Proposed methodology significantly improves medical text semantic analysis over traditional NLP metrics.
- Established interpretable framework for using LLMs' reasoning capabilities for specialized text analysis.
- Framework is domain agnostic and can be extended to other specialized domains.

In summary, this paper introduces an innovative methodology leveraging GPT-4 and semantic embeddings to achieve more meaningful similarity analysis of medical texts. The proposed solution outperforms standard NLP metrics, demonstrating the promise of using LLMs to develop superior healthcare analytics.
