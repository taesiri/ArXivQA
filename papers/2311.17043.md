# [LLaMA-VID: An Image is Worth 2 Tokens in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17043)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces LLaMA-VID, an approach to efficiently encode long videos while preserving critical information for vision language models (VLMs). The key idea is representing each frame with two tokens: a context token that encodes overall image context based on user input, and a content token that captures frame visual cues and can be compressed adaptively. The context token aggregates the most informative visual features guided by instruction queries. The content token adaptively downsamples frame features to maintain efficiency. This dual-token strategy can represent an hour-long video within existing VLMs' capacity while retaining long-term dependencies. Experiments on video QA datasets show LLaMA-VID enables existing 7B parameter models to outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. Ablations validate the effectiveness of both the context and content tokens. Furthermore, interactive visualization of the context attention's response demonstrates it focuses on instruction-relevant regions. In summary, LLaMA-VID pushes the boundary of VLMs for long video understanding with the proposed efficient dual-token encoding approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes LLaMA-VID, a method to efficiently represent video frames with a context token that encodes overall image context based on user input and a content token that captures visual details, enabling large language models to support long video understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LLaMA-VID, a novel approach to efficiently represent video frames and images using dual tokens - a context token and a content token - in order to enable vision language models (VLMs) to process long videos. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A dual-token strategy to represent each video frame with a context token that encodes the overall image context based on user input, and a content token that captures visual cues in each frame. This significantly reduces the computational overload for long videos while preserving critical information.

2) An efficient token generation approach that employs instruction-guided queries to aggregate text-related visual features into a context token, and adapts the content token length based on constraints. This allows supporting videos over an hour in length.

3) Construction of an instruction-based dataset with 9K movie-level conversations for plot reasoning and detail understanding in long videos. This is used to tune the model.

4) State-of-the-art results on several video- and image-based benchmarks by employing the proposed LLaMA-VID framework. It outperforms previous methods on most tasks, proving its effectiveness.

In summary, LLaMA-VID enables existing VLMs to efficiently process long videos by representing each frame with just two tokens, pushing their limits. The dual-token strategy and tuning methodology are the major innovations presented.
