# [All-in-one platform for AI R&amp;D in medical imaging, encompassing data   collection, selection, annotation, and pre-processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
1) There is a significant imbalance in medical imaging data, with over 90% coming from Europe/America and under 10% from Asia despite Asia having 60% of the global population. This lack of diverse data creates bias. 
2) Preparing proprietary medical imaging datasets for commercial AI research is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. There is no existing platform covering all the necessary steps from data collection to preprocessing.

Proposed Solution:
The authors have created the first all-in-one commercial platform for medical imaging AI research, encompassing:
1) Data Collection: Establishing partnerships with hospitals/clinics to obtain CT, MRI and pathology image data, as well as associated clinical and genetic data.
2) Data Selection: Curating and excluding suboptimal data.  
3) Annotation: Precisely delineating lesions, structures and generating radiology/pathology reports.
4) Preprocessing: Reducing noise, aligning paired scans over time, standardizing formats.  

The platform specifically focuses on collecting underrepresented data from Japan and Asia. The datasets are offered to AI and medical device companies to accelerate research. Custom AI solutions are also developed using the datasets.

Main Contributions:
1) First all-in-one platform covering data collection to preprocessing to enable medical imaging AI research.
2) Mitigates data imbalance by commercially sharing Asian data.  
3) Aims to use blockchain for secure data sharing.
4) Plans to synthesize rare disease data using generative AI.

In summary, the authors have developed an integrated platform to share, process and monetize diverse medical imaging data from Asia to accelerate global AI research and transparency.
