# [Visual Hindsight Self-Imitation Learning for Interactive Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Visual Hindsight Self-Imitation Learning for Interactive Navigation":

Problem:
- Interactive visual navigation tasks are challenging as they require reaching specific targets and interacting with them based on instructions. 
- Learning these tasks is difficult due to the high-dimensional visual inputs and sparsity of useful feedback signals.
- Prior methods rely on intricate reward shaping by experts or expensive demonstration datasets. Hindsight experience replay (HER) methods are difficult to apply in vision-based partially observable settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Visual Hindsight Self-Imitation Learning (VHS), which enhances sample efficiency through hindsight goal re-labeling of failed episodes and promotes deeper exploration through self-imitation learning.
- A Prototypical Goal (PG) embedding method is introduced to enable re-labeling in vision-based environments. Instead of word embeddings, PG uses the average embedding of experienced goal observations.
- In failed episodes, the final observation is set as the new goal via PG. The re-labeled trajectories are used for self-imitation.

Main Contributions:
- VHS achieves state-of-the-art success rates and sample efficiency on interactive visual navigation tasks with only intuitive sparse rewards, without relying on demonstrations.
- PG enables hindsight re-labeling and outperforms word embeddings, while reflecting crucial visual features of goals like shape and color.
- The research shows the promise of integrating ideas like HER in real-time vision-based domains without prior data collection.

In summary, the paper makes interactive visual navigation more feasible through an innovative combination of prototypical goal representations, hindsight re-labeling and self-imitation.
