# [UAV-Assisted Maritime Search and Rescue: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14281)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Maritime search and rescue (SAR) operations face challenges due to the vast and unpredictable nature of ocean environments. Traditional manned vessels and aircraft have limitations in speed, accessibility and risk to human life.

- Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer new possibilities with enhanced efficiency, safety and endurance, but they also come with their own constraints related to different drone types.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores the application of different UAVs in maritime SAR, focusing on medium-sized fixed-wing drones and quadcopters. 

- It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these UAV types and how they could be utilized effectively at different stages of a maritime SAR mission.

- A key contribution is the development of a comprehensive software framework to enable preliminary detection onboard UAVs and more advanced detection on regions of interest at a ground station. 

- The onboard detection generates regions of interest (RoIs) to be the focus for the detection system and operator, transmitted in full quality while the rest of the image is lower quality to account for limited bandwidth.

- Several RoI proposal methods are evaluated, especially under simulated bandwidth constraints to test performance when bandwidth is restricted in remote/offshore operations.

Main Contributions:

- Analysis of different UAV types for maritime SAR and how they can play complementary roles 

- Novel software framework design enabling preliminary onboard detection and selective high quality transmission of regions of interest

- Comparative experiments with RoI proposal methods focused on bandwidth limitations to test real-world applicability

- Guidelines for choosing appropriate UAVs depending on the search mission stage and objectives

In summary, the key innovation is in advancing the integration of UAVs in maritime SAR through a specialized software solution aimed at improving efficiency, effectiveness and reducing operators' visual strain.
