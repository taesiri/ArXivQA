# [On the $O(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{T^{1/4}})$ Convergence Rate of RMSProp and Its   Momentum Extension Measured by $\ell_1$ Norm: Better Dependence on the   Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of stochastic optimization of a smooth nonconvex function $f(\x)$ represented as the expectation over a data distribution. Adaptive gradient methods like RMSProp and its momentum extension are very popular for training deep neural networks, but their convergence rates are not well understood, especially the dependence on the high dimensionality ($d$) of the problem. Existing convergence rates for these methods have a suboptimal dependence on $d$ compared to SGD. 

Main Contributions:
1. The paper provides a convergence rate of $\Ocal(\sqrt{d}/T^{1/4})$ for RMSProp and its momentum extension measured in $\ell_1$ norm, under standard assumptions like smoothness and affine variance of the stochastic gradients. 

2. Notably, this rate does not require the bounded gradients assumption commonly made in related work. The analysis uses new techniques to show gradients are bounded along the optimization path.

3. For high dimensional problems where $\|\x\|_2 \ll \|\x\|_1 \leq \sqrt{d}\|\x\|_2$, the established rate is analogous to the $\Ocal(1/T^{1/4})$ rate of SGD in $\ell_2$ norm. So it matches the benchmark SGD rate in terms of dependence on both iteration count $T$ and dimensionality $d$.

4. The analysis also provides explicit dependence on problem-related quantities like initial suboptimality, smoothness constant, and gradient variances. The convergence guarantee holds for common settings of algorithms hyperparameters.

To summarize, the paper provides an improved analysis of popular adaptive methods RMSProp and its momentum variant, closing the gap with SGD's convergence rate in terms of dependence on dimensionality and iterations. The rates are established under standard assumptions, with tighter control of dependencies on problem parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper establishes an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/T^{1/4})$ convergence rate measured by $\ell_1$ norm for RMSProp and its momentum extension under affine variance assumptions, achieving better dimension dependence than existing results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proving the convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{T^{1/4}})$ for RMSProp and its momentum extension measured by the $\ell_1$ norm. Specifically:

- The paper establishes this convergence rate under the affine variance assumption without needing to assume bounded gradients. This makes the result more widely applicable.

- The $\ell_1$ norm dependence allows the rate to be comparable to SGD's $\ell_2$ rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T^{1/4}})$, since $\|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \ll \|\mathbf{x}\|_1 \leq \sqrt{d}\|\mathbf{x}\|_2$ for high dimensional problems. So effectively their rate has the same dimension dependence as SGD.

- The constants in the convergence rate have superior dependence on the dimension $d$ compared to prior work on adaptive methods. Specifically, the constants do not implicitly depend on $d$.

So in summary, the paper provides the first convergence rate result for RMSProp and its momentum extension that matches the dimension dependence of SGD under weaker assumptions. This helps bridge the gap between the practical performance of these adaptive methods and their poorer theoretical convergence guarantees.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- RMSProp - The RMSProp adaptive gradient descent algorithm that is analyzed.

- Momentum - Referring to the momentum extension of RMSProp that is also analyzed. 

- Convergence rate - The rate at which the algorithms converge to an optimal solution. This is the main focus of analysis.

- $\ell_1$ norm - The paper analyzes the convergence rate measured by the $\ell_1$ norm of the gradient. 

- Dimension dependence - A key aspect is analyzing how the convergence rate depends on the dimension $d$ of the optimization problem.

- Bounded gradient assumption - An assumption commonly made that the paper avoids.

- Affine variance assumption - A weaker assumption made instead of bounded gradients.

- Nonconvex optimization - The paper focuses on the convergence rate for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems.

- Deep learning - Though not directly analyzed, RMSProp and momentum methods are widely used in deep learning, providing motivation.

So in summary, the key terms cover the specific algorithms, the convergence analysis, the assumptions made, the use of $\ell_1$ norm, dimension dependence, and context of nonconvex optimization and deep learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper establishes a convergence rate of O(√d/T^1/4) for RMSProp and its momentum extension measured by the l1 norm. Why is measuring convergence by the l1 norm more suitable for problems with extremely large dimensionality compared to the traditional l2 norm?

2. The paper states that their convergence rate is analogous to the O(1/T^1/4) rate for SGD measured by the l1 norm. Explain why this analogy is reasonable given the relationship between the l1 and l2 norms. 

3. What are the key technical contributions that allow removing the bounded gradient assumption commonly made for analyzing adaptive gradient methods? Explain the role of Lemmas 4-6.  

4. The constants C and C' in the convergence rate bounds depend on various problem-specific quantities. Why did the authors choose to not include terms like ∥∇f(x1)∥^2 and maxi σi in these constants, even though it could potentially make the rates tighter?

5. Compare the convergence rate proven in this paper for RMSProp to known rates in the literature like the O(d log T/√T) rate. Explain why the new rate can be considered superior, especially for large-scale deep learning applications.

6. What modifications would be needed to extend the analysis in this paper to prove convergence rates for other popular adaptive methods like Adam or AdaGrad? What challenges do you foresee?

7. The paper utilizes an l1 norm analysis. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using an l1 versus l2 analysis for bounding convergence of adaptive methods. 

8. Is the established lower bound of Ω(√d/T^1/4) for adaptive methods matching the upper bound proven in this paper? Justify your answer.

9. The paper claims their rate is tight in terms of dependence on the dimension d. Do you think further improvements in terms of d are possible through more advanced analysis techniques?

10. The analysis relies on several key supporting lemmas. Pick one lemma and explain how relaxing the assumptions in that lemma could impact the overall convergence rate proven in the paper.
