# [Story Visualization by Online Text Augmentation with Context Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07575)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve story visualization (SV) by better encoding context spread across multiple sentences and handling linguistic variations in the text descriptions?Specifically, the key points are:- Story visualization is challenging because it requires generating a sequence of images from a paragraph that captures both visual details and narrative context across sentences. - Prior work has focused on generating relevant images for each sentence, but encoding overall context across sentences remains difficult.- The authors propose a new memory architecture for transformers to selectively utilize context, and an online text augmentation method to handle linguistic variations. - They aim to show these techniques can significantly improve performance on SV benchmarks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the main hypothesis is that their proposed context memory module and online text augmentation will allow better modeling of long-term context and linguistic variations, leading to improved story visualization compared to existing approaches. The experiments aim to demonstrate these improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new memory architecture for the Transformer framework to better encode past context and long-term dependencies in story visualization. Specifically, the paper introduces an attentively weighted memory module that selectively utilizes relevant past contexts.2. Proposing an online text augmentation technique during training to generate diverse pseudo-text descriptions. This is aimed at improving the model's robustness to linguistic variations at inference time. 3. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on two story visualization benchmarks (Pororo-SV and Flintstones-SV). The proposed method outperforms prior approaches on various metrics including FID, character F1, frame accuracy, BLEU, and R-precision.4. Conducting extensive experiments to validate the benefits of the proposed memory architecture and online augmentation scheme. Ablation studies demonstrate the improvements from adding each component.In summary, the core ideas are using a context memory module and online text augmentation to help the model better understand long-term semantics and generalize to linguistic variations in story visualization. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:The paper proposes a new memory architecture and online text augmentation method to improve contextual coherence and address linguistic variations in story visualization, outperforming prior methods on benchmark datasets.
