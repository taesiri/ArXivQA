# [NU-Class Net: A Novel Deep Learning-based Approach for Video Quality   Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01163)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Video traffic is dominating internet bandwidth and storage, accounting for over 80% of traffic. This causes issues with bandwidth utilization, storage space, and energy consumption related to computing systems. 
- Video compression helps address these issues by reducing video size, but higher compression causes quality degradation and requires more computation power. This is problematic for resource-constrained IoT devices trying to capture and transmit video.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose NU-Class Net, a deep learning model to enhance the quality of low bitrate compressed videos. 
- It works by having the encoder use heavy compression to reduce size and complexity. Then on the decoder side, NU-Class Net is applied to eliminate compression artifacts and restore perceptible quality close to the original high bitrate video.

Main Contributions:
- NU-Class Net architecture based on U-Net that can effectively eliminate coding noise and enhance detail in low bitrate video frames.
- Method to train the network by extracting raw and compressed frames from video to use as ground truth.
- Quantitative metrics and visual results that demonstrate NU-Class Net improves video quality by 30-40% based on PSNR, SSIM, etc.
- Approach maintains codec orthogonality for easy integration and does not modify codec itself.
- Facilitates lower complexity encoding for resource constrained IoT devices while enhancing quality on less constrained decoder side.
- Generalizable model that performs well on unseen videos by learning fine details rather than context.

In summary, the paper introduces a deep learning solution called NU-Class Net to address the major tradeoffs between video compression, quality, bandwidth utilization and computational complexity that persist in video IoT systems. By enhancing compressed video quality after decoding, their method provides an efficient video pipeline.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces NU-Class Net, an innovative deep learning model designed to enhance the visual quality of low bitrate video streams by predicting and compensating for compression artifacts after decoding, enabling efficient video transmission and storage without codec modifications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing NU-Class Net, an innovative deep learning model for enhancing the quality of low bitrate compressed videos. Specifically:

- NU-Class Net is designed to mitigate compression artifacts and noise in low bitrate videos by predicting the residual between the original high quality frames and compressed low quality frames. This allows the use of simpler encoders at the edge devices while reconstructing higher video quality at the decoder side.

- The model employs an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by U-Net, with strategic modifications such as wider convolution filters, residual connections, skip connections, and instance normalization to make it suitable for the video enhancement task.

- Three variants of NU-Class Net are introduced - basic, sequential, and diffusion models - with the sequential and diffusion versions aiming to improve temporal consistency and image quality respectively.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate NU-Class Net's ability to effectively improve both numerical metrics like PSNR, SSIM as well as perceptual quality of compressed videos. The models generalize well to unseen videos.

In summary, NU-Class Net contributes an effective deep learning approach for post-processing based enhancement of compressed video quality, with practical applications in bandwidth and computation constrained scenarios like IoT systems.
