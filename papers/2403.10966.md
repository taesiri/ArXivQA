# [Robust Co-Design of Canonical Underactuated Systems for Increased   Certifiable Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optimizing the control and design of underactuated robotic systems is challenging due to the coupled nature of trajectory optimization, stabilization control, and mechanical design. 
- Traditional approaches that iterate between trajectory optimization and hardware design fail to find the globally optimal solution.
- Existing co-design methods lack considerations for real-world uncertainties and robustness against disturbances.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new co-design algorithm called RTC-D that concurrently optimizes the trajectory, controller gains, and design parameters.
- It uses direct transcription (DIRTRAN) for trajectory optimization and time-varying LQR (TVLQR) for stabilization control.
- The cost function incorporates the volume of the estimated region of attraction (ROA) to maximize robustness. 
- RTC-D has two layers - an inner RTC layer for trajectory and control optimization, and an outer design optimization layer.
- It uses CMA-ES, a gradient-free optimization strategy suitable for such bilevel optimization problems.

Main Contributions:
- Novel integration of DIRTRAN, TVLQR and ROA analysis for control and trajectory co-design.
- Introduction of ROA volume as a robustness metric in the cost function.
- RTC-D algorithm with an inner control optimization loop and outer mechanical design loop.
- Testing on two underactuated systems - torque-limited pendulum and cartpole.
- Improved performance demonstrated through extensive simulations and real robot experiments.
- Up to 4x increase in estimated ROA volume compared to initial non-optimal solution.
- Experimentally validated to reject disturbances and stabilize underactuated systems.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in developing a new robust co-design framework RTC-D that can optimize underactuated robots for maximal region of attraction against uncertainties.
