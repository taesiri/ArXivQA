# [Explanatory Learning: Beyond Empiricism in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10222)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we design machine learning systems that can effectively leverage existing symbolic knowledge and learn to interpret it, in order to discover explanations for novel phenomena like humans do?The key hypothesis appears to be:By taking a "rationalist" approach that focuses on interpreting existing symbolic knowledge, rather than just an "empiricist" end-to-end learning approach, machine learning systems can more effectively discover explanations for new phenomena given existing explanatory knowledge, similar to how human scientists leverage existing theories and knowledge to explain new discoveries. Specifically, the authors propose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs) as a model that separates the learning into two components - a generator of symbolic conjecture explanations, and an interpreter that learns to map explanations to observations. They hypothesize this will outperform standard neural network approaches on tasks requiring explanatory generalization.So in summary, the central research question is how to design ML systems that can leverage symbolic knowledge to explain new phenomena, and the key hypothesis is that a rationalist approach with separate conjecture generation and interpretation will work better than end-to-end empirical learning. The CRN model is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing a new framework called Explanatory Learning (EL) for learning to interpret symbolic explanations paired with observations in order to make predictions on new phenomena. This allows machines to make use of existing knowledge without needing a rigid compiler or grammar.2. Presenting a new environment called Odeen for testing EL approaches. Odeen simulates scientific discovery in a simple "universe" of geometric shapes and rules.3. Proposing Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs) as a "rationalist" approach to EL that focuses on interpreting existing knowledge and explanations rather than solely extracting patterns from data. CRNs have an explicit conjecture generator and learned interpreter.4. Comparing CRNs to end-to-end "empiricist" neural networks on the Odeen benchmark. The results show CRNs can discover the correct explanations for a much higher percentage of new phenomena compared to the neural networks.5. Analyzing properties of CRNs like handling ambiguity, explainability, adjustable thinking time, and confidence estimation. The authors argue CRNs are more aligned with how humans acquire knowledge compared to standard deep learning models.In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing the EL framework and Odeen environment, as well as proposing and evaluating the CRN model as a rationalist approach well-suited for explanatory learning compared to end-to-end empirical methods.
