# [Explanatory Learning: Beyond Empiricism in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10222)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we design machine learning systems that can effectively leverage existing symbolic knowledge and learn to interpret it, in order to discover explanations for novel phenomena like humans do?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By taking a "rationalist" approach that focuses on interpreting existing symbolic knowledge, rather than just an "empiricist" end-to-end learning approach, machine learning systems can more effectively discover explanations for new phenomena given existing explanatory knowledge, similar to how human scientists leverage existing theories and knowledge to explain new discoveries. 

Specifically, the authors propose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs) as a model that separates the learning into two components - a generator of symbolic conjecture explanations, and an interpreter that learns to map explanations to observations. They hypothesize this will outperform standard neural network approaches on tasks requiring explanatory generalization.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design ML systems that can leverage symbolic knowledge to explain new phenomena, and the key hypothesis is that a rationalist approach with separate conjecture generation and interpretation will work better than end-to-end empirical learning. The CRN model is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing a new framework called Explanatory Learning (EL) for learning to interpret symbolic explanations paired with observations in order to make predictions on new phenomena. This allows machines to make use of existing knowledge without needing a rigid compiler or grammar.

2. Presenting a new environment called Odeen for testing EL approaches. Odeen simulates scientific discovery in a simple "universe" of geometric shapes and rules.

3. Proposing Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs) as a "rationalist" approach to EL that focuses on interpreting existing knowledge and explanations rather than solely extracting patterns from data. CRNs have an explicit conjecture generator and learned interpreter.

4. Comparing CRNs to end-to-end "empiricist" neural networks on the Odeen benchmark. The results show CRNs can discover the correct explanations for a much higher percentage of new phenomena compared to the neural networks.

5. Analyzing properties of CRNs like handling ambiguity, explainability, adjustable thinking time, and confidence estimation. The authors argue CRNs are more aligned with how humans acquire knowledge compared to standard deep learning models.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing the EL framework and Odeen environment, as well as proposing and evaluating the CRN model as a rationalist approach well-suited for explanatory learning compared to end-to-end empirical methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper introduces Explanatory Learning, a framework for machines to interpret symbolic knowledge, such as explanations in natural language, in order to make predictions and discover new knowledge, rather than relying solely on statistical patterns in data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in explanatory learning and rationalist AI:

- The concept of Explanatory Learning (EL) seems relatively new and this paper provides one of the first formal frameworks for it. Related prior work like Angluin's learning of regular sets or program synthesis do not fully capture the goals and approach of EL.

- The introduction of an EL environment and benchmark like Odeen is a novel contribution. Many prior works have proposed AI environments and benchmarks, but Odeen's focus on scientific discovery and abduction appears unique.

- The proposal of Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs) aligns with a growing interest in rationalist AI, explainable models, and incorporating prior knowledge. However, the specific CRN design does not seem to directly follow any prior work. The interpretable model architecture resonates with some prior ideas like neuro-symbolic AI.

- The comparison of CRNs to end-to-end empiricist models is a useful empirical analysis. It provides evidence for the benefits of the rationalist approach in this new EL setting. But the scope is limited to one environment and simple baselines.

- The connections made to long-standing debates like empiricism vs rationalism are thought-provoking but also quite philosophical. The concepts and hypotheses need more rigorous investigation.

Overall, this paper introduces some interesting new ideas to the intersection of machine learning and scientific reasoning. The EL framework, Odeen environment, and CRN model offer original contributions. But significant more work seems needed to fully develop and evaluate these concepts. The empirical analysis is limited in scope. And the philosophical undertones raise more questions than answers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more complex environments and languages for the Explanatory Learning paradigm, beyond the current Odeen benchmark. The authors suggest adjusting parameters like structure length, number of shapes/attributes, and grammar specifications to create more challenging EL problems.

- Studying the performance of EL models under adversarial attacks or biased training data. The authors believe CRNs may be more robust in these settings compared to end-to-end neural networks.

- Extending the framework to include an active interaction phase, where the model must discover its own observations rather than being provided a pre-determined dataset. This could better simulate the full scientific discovery process.

- Analyzing the binary semantic representations in more depth. The authors provide some initial analysis of the Odeen semantic matrix but leave further exploration for future work.

- Applying the EL paradigm to real-world tasks and domains beyond the current geometric Odeen environment. The authors believe the overall concepts could transfer, but practical applications remain to be demonstrated.

- Comparing CRNs against a wider range of model architectures and training techniques, beyond the Transformer baselines presented.

- Investigating algorithmic fairness, transparency, and interpretability within the EL framework, as CRNs provide some advantages in these areas over black-box models.

Overall, the authors frame Explanatory Learning as a rich paradigm with many promising research directions remaining to be explored in future work. The key themes seem to be developing more complex languages and environments, testing the robustness of EL models, and ultimately applying the concepts to real-world domains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new machine learning approach called Explanatory Learning (EL) that allows machines to learn to interpret symbolic explanations in order to make predictions about novel phenomena. The authors present EL as an alternative to dominant empiricist machine learning approaches that attempt to extract all necessary knowledge directly from data. They argue that EL better resembles how humans acquire knowledge, by interpreting explanations expressed in language and applying that knowledge to make predictions. As a testbed for EL, the authors introduce Odeen, a simulated environment inspired by scientific discovery where the goal is to explain new phenomena given existing explanations for other phenomena. They propose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs) as a model that implements the EL approach, with separate learned components for generating explanatory conjectures and interpreting them. In experiments on Odeen, CRNs outperform similar transformer-based empiricist models at discovering correct explanations for new phenomena. The authors posit that the rationalist foundation of CRNs allows them to better leverage explanatory knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Explanatory Learning (EL), a framework for training machines to interpret and generate symbolic explanations. The authors argue that the dominant empiricist machine learning paradigm is insufficient for acquiring true explanatory knowledge. Instead, they propose a rationalist approach called Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs). 

The paper presents Odeen, a puzzle game environment for testing EL models. In Odeen, the goal is to infer the secret rule explaining a new puzzle game given a small sample of labeled puzzle configurations and explanations for other games. Experiments in Odeen demonstrate that CRNs substantially outperform transformer-based empiricist models. The CRN model can accurately interpret novel configurations and generate the underlying explanatory rule. The results support the potential of EL and rationalist models like CRNs for developing more human-like explanatory reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs), a new approach to explanatory learning that is inspired by the epistemology of critical rationalism. The CRN consists of two main components - a Conjecture Generator and an Interpreter. The Conjecture Generator proposes possible explanatory rules given a small set of observations. The Interpreter evaluates how well each proposed rule explains all the observations, and selects the best rule. At test time, the CRN is given a new unexplained phenomenon with a few observations. It generates candidate explanations using the Conjecture Generator, evaluates them with the Interpreter, and selects the best explanation. This allows the CRN to discover explanations for novel phenomena given limited observations, by leveraging its learned ability to generate and evaluate candidate explanatory rules. The CRN is applied to a new dataset called Odeen that simulates scientific discovery, and is shown to outperform end-to-end neural models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper is addressing the problem of how to enable machines to use and discover symbolic knowledge or explanations, as humans do through language. The key questions seem to be:

1) How can we formulate the problem of a machine learning to interpret explanations and language in general, so that it can use existing symbolic knowledge to make predictions about novel phenomena?

2) How can we design a model that can discover new symbolic explanations for phenomena given some observations, much like human scientists do? 

The authors introduce a new framework called "Explanatory Learning" to formulate this problem, as well as a model called "Critical Rationalist Networks" that aims to tackle it through a rationalist approach, in contrast to dominant empiricist machine learning paradigms. They also present a new environment called Odeen for testing and benchmarking approaches for explanatory learning.

So in summary, the key focus is on enabling machines to leverage and discover symbolic explanations, by learning to interpret and master a language, going beyond current empirical/statistical approaches to machine learning. The paper introduces a formulation, model and environment to study this problem.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the main points of the paper:

This paper introduces Explanatory Learning (EL), a framework for teaching machines to interpret symbolic explanations and use them to make predictions about novel phenomena. The authors argue that current machine learning approaches rely too heavily on an empiricist view that treats data as theory-free. They propose instead a rationalist approach embodied in Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs). A CRN consists of two components: a Conjecture Generator that proposes symbolic explanations given observations of a phenomenon, and a learned Interpreter that evaluates explanations and makes predictions. The authors introduce Odeen, a universe of simple geometric figures and rules describing them, as a testbed for EL approaches. Experiments on Odeen show that CRNs can effectively discover the correct explanations for new phenomena given training explanations paired with observations, outperforming end-to-end neural models. A key advantage of CRNs is that they yield human-interpretable explanations that causally justify their predictions. The authors conclude that CRNs offer a promising direction for machine learning systems that can leverage existing knowledge and explanations to achieve deeper generalization and interpretability.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Explanatory Learning (EL), a framework for training machines to interpret symbolic explanations in order to make predictions about novel phenomena without direct experience. They formulate EL as a binary classification task where models are given explanations paired with observations for some phenomena, and must use this to interpret a new explanation and make predictions on an unexplained phenomenon. The authors argue that standard neural network approaches follow an empiricist view that is insufficient for EL. They propose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs), inspired by a rationalist epistemology, which have separate modules for generating conjecture explanations and interpreting them against observations. The paper introduces Odeen, a universe of simple geometric figures and rules, as a testbed for EL approaches. Experiments on Odeen show CRNs substantially outperform transformer-based empiricist models, demonstrating their superior ability to discover explanations for new phenomena given limited observations. The work offers a new perspective on integrating symbolic knowledge into neural networks through learned interpretation.
