# [WESPER: Zero-shot and Realtime Whisper to Normal Voice Conversion for   Whisper-based Speech Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.1639)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to develop a zero-shot, real-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion method that does not require paired whisper/normal speech data or speaker-dependent training.The key hypothesis appears to be that a self-supervised speech encoder-decoder model can learn to convert whispered speech to normal speech in a speaker-independent manner without needing paired training data, by learning to extract common speech units from both whispered and normal speech.In summary, the main research goals are:- Develop a real-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion system- Achieve speaker-independent conversion without user-specific training - Eliminate the need for paired whisper/normal speech training data- Use self-supervised pre-training to extract shared speech units from unpaired whisper and normal speechThe proposed WESPER model aims to address these challenges.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing WESPER, a real-time and zero-shot whisper-to-normal voice conversion method based on self-supervised learning. The key points are:- WESPER can convert whispered speech to normal speech in a speaker-independent manner without needing parallel whispered-normal speech datasets. It is based on a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder and unit-to-speech (UTS) decoder architecture.- The STU encoder is pre-trained on unlabeled whispered and normal speech to learn common speech units for both. This allows converting whispered speech to these common units. - The UTS decoder can be trained on any target speaker's speech to reconstruct speech from the common units in their voice. No text labels are needed.- This zero-shot whisper-to-normal conversion improves the quality and intelligibility of whispered speech while retaining natural prosody.- WESPER is evaluated on both normal whispered speech and speech of people with disorders. It shows improved quality and preserved prosody in both cases.- The conversion happens in real-time, enabling applications like whisper-based speech interactions.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a self-supervised method to perform zero-shot, real-time, and speaker-independent whisper-to-normal speech conversion to improve quality and intelligibility while retaining prosody.
