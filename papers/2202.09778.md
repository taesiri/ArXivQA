# [Pseudo Numerical Methods for Diffusion Models on Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we accelerate the sampling process of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) while maintaining high sample quality?The key points are:- DDPMs generate high-quality samples like images and audio, but require hundreds to thousands of iterative denoising steps which is very slow. - Prior methods like DDIM and PFs try to speed up DDPMs by changing the variance schedule or denoising equation, but sacrifice sample quality at high speedup rates.- This paper proposes treating DDPMs as solving differential equations on manifolds and develops new "pseudo-numerical methods" that can accelerate sampling while maintaining quality.- The key ideas are: (1) DDPMs generate samples along a manifold, not a straight line, so classical numerical methods can introduce noise. (2) The inference equations are ill-defined off the manifold. (3) They design new numerical integrators that stay on the manifold.- Their pseudo-numerical methods combine benefits of DDIM (quality) and classical high-order integrators (speed) to achieve fast sampling without quality loss.In summary, the central question is how to speed up DDPM sampling while maintaining the sample quality, which they address by developing new pseudo-numerical methods tailored for the manifold structure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing pseudo numerical methods for diffusion models (PNDMs) to accelerate the sampling process while maintaining high sample quality. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Establishing a theoretical connection between denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and numerical methods for solving differential equations. The paper shows how the sampling process in DDPMs can be viewed as approximately solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) derived from the diffusion process. - Analyzing issues with directly applying classical numerical methods like Euler and Runge-Kutta to this ODE, namely sampling away from the data manifold and unbounded gradients. - Proposing the use of "pseudo" numerical methods that are adapted to stay on the data manifold and leverage the denoising model's predictions. The paper shows DDIMs can be viewed as a simple pseudo method.- Introducing new pseudo linear multi-step methods that combine the benefits of DDIMs and higher-order classical methods. These PNDMs are shown to be faster and higher quality than DDIMs.- Providing theoretical analysis to show the proposed PNDMs have superior convergence properties over DDIMs. Experiments also demonstrate PNDMs can match the sample quality of 1000-step DDPMs with only 50 steps.In summary, the key contribution is developing PNDMs as numerically-grounded techniques to accelerate sampling for DDPMs while maintaining sample quality. The theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prior acceleration methods.
