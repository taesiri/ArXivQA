# [TailorMe: Self-Supervised Learning of an Anatomically Constrained   Volumetric Human Shape Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing human shape models focus on modeling the skin surface and lack internal anatomical details like the skeleton. This limits their ability to realistically manipulate the shape of virtual humans, especially for localized modifications like changing the composition of specific body parts. Methods that do incorporate anatomy either do not fully decouple skeleton from skin shape or require complex optimization schemes that are too slow for interactive applications.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new anatomically constrained volumetric human shape model called TailorMe. The key ideas are:

1) Build a template model with separate layers for skeleton and skin surface. Register this model to a database of 3D scans to get pairs of skeleton and skin meshes.

2) Enlarge the dataset by transferring soft tissue between different subjects using volumetric deformation transfer. This creates training data with all combinations of skeletons and tissue distributions.

3) Train a convolutional autoencoder on this data to learn a compact latent space. Add anthropometric measurements as conditional inputs to enable localized control. Use a novel Barlow Twins loss to decouple skeleton from skin shape.  

4) Postprocess decoded shapes to resolve artifacts and embed a high-res skeleton.

Main Contributions:

- A method to compute soft tissue transfer between subjects with volumetric fidelity to avoid self-intersections
- A self-supervised learning approach to decouple skeleton from skin shape in a compact latent space 
- Injection of measurements into the latent code to enable localized shape modifications
- Significantly faster inference than previous anatomy-aware methods
- Evaluation showing improved localization over PCA models and better anatomy than a linear regressor baseline

The model allows realisticmodification of virtual humans by fitting to 3D scans and manipulating the latent code. It has applications in body image therapy and generating synthetic training data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents TailorMe, a self-supervised deep learning model for anatomically constrained volumetric human shape modeling that enables localized shape manipulation by inferring skeleton shape from surface scans and injecting anthropometric measurements into the latent code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting "TailorMe", a novel approach for learning a volumetric anatomically constrained human shape model. The key aspects of this contribution are:

1) Computing the Cartesian product of skeleton shapes and soft tissue distributions from the CAESAR database using volumetric deformation transfer. This enlarged the training data.

2) Using a Barlow Twins inspired learning approach to train an autoencoder that decouples the two shape dimensions - skeleton and soft tissue. 

3) The resulting model can be used for shape sampling and provides localized shape manipulation due to the injected measurements in the latent space.

4) Compared to other methods, this model better decouples skeleton and soft tissue shape, allows more localized shape manipulation, and provides significantly faster inference time.

In summary, the main contribution is the method for learning an anatomically constrained volumetric human shape model that enables localized shape control.

It uses self-supervised learning on a dataset created by registering a volumetric template to scans and computing the Cartesian product via volumetric deformation transfer. The model is trained with an autoencoder using a loss based on the Barlow Twins method, and includes measurement injection to enable semantic control. Key applications are modifying virtual humans and sampling diverse body shapes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using volumetric deformation transfer to compute the Cartesian product of skeleton shapes and soft tissue distributions. Can you explain in more detail how this process works and how it enables decoupling of the two shape dimensions? 

2. The autoencoder design utilizes convolutional blocks based on SpiralNet++. What are the key benefits of using this convolutional operator compared to other options? How does it facilitate the localization of shape changes when modifying semantic parameters?

3. The paper introduces a cross-correlation loss inspired by the Barlow Twins method. Can you explain the intuition behind using quadruplets instead of pairs in the loss formulation? How does this help in reducing redundancy between skeleton and soft tissue parameters?

4. The high-resolution anatomical template model was specially commissioned for this work. What considerations went into the design and creation of this template model compared to using publicly available assets?

5. The paper compares the approach to a multilinear model (MLM). What are the key differences in formulation between the two methods? Why does the MLM not achieve complete decoupling of shape dimensions?

6. What post-processing steps are applied after decoder inference and why are they necessary? Can you explain the technical details behind the face symmetrization, smoothing, and high-resolution skeleton embedding? 

7. The model evaluation computes mean vertex errors on the test set. Why is the error higher in the chest and abdomen regions? What could be done to improve accuracy in these areas?

8. When resolving collisions between predicted skeleton and skin, the paper solves an optimization problem. Explain the different energy terms and constraints used in the formulation.

9. For shape manipulation of 3D scans, a delta between original and modified latent codes is applied. Why is stitching the original head necessary in this process?
