# [TailorMe: Self-Supervised Learning of an Anatomically Constrained   Volumetric Human Shape Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing human shape models focus on modeling the skin surface and lack internal anatomical details like the skeleton. This limits their ability to realistically manipulate the shape of virtual humans, especially for localized modifications like changing the composition of specific body parts. Methods that do incorporate anatomy either do not fully decouple skeleton from skin shape or require complex optimization schemes that are too slow for interactive applications.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new anatomically constrained volumetric human shape model called TailorMe. The key ideas are:

1) Build a template model with separate layers for skeleton and skin surface. Register this model to a database of 3D scans to get pairs of skeleton and skin meshes.

2) Enlarge the dataset by transferring soft tissue between different subjects using volumetric deformation transfer. This creates training data with all combinations of skeletons and tissue distributions.

3) Train a convolutional autoencoder on this data to learn a compact latent space. Add anthropometric measurements as conditional inputs to enable localized control. Use a novel Barlow Twins loss to decouple skeleton from skin shape.  

4) Postprocess decoded shapes to resolve artifacts and embed a high-res skeleton.

Main Contributions:

- A method to compute soft tissue transfer between subjects with volumetric fidelity to avoid self-intersections
- A self-supervised learning approach to decouple skeleton from skin shape in a compact latent space 
- Injection of measurements into the latent code to enable localized shape modifications
- Significantly faster inference than previous anatomy-aware methods
- Evaluation showing improved localization over PCA models and better anatomy than a linear regressor baseline

The model allows realisticmodification of virtual humans by fitting to 3D scans and manipulating the latent code. It has applications in body image therapy and generating synthetic training data.
