# [Correlation and Unintended Biases on Univariate and Multivariate   Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01884)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes the performance differences between univariate decision trees (UDTs), which use axis-parallel splits, and multivariate decision trees (MDTs), which use oblique splits. Through experiments on synthetic data, the authors find that feature correlation, complexity of the decision boundary, and label noise impact the relative performance. Specifically, MDTs perform better with high feature correlation and oblique decision boundaries, while UDTs are more robust to label noise. The paper then analyzes 57 standard benchmark datasets, finding they are biased towards low feature correlation and approximatively axis-parallel decision boundaries. Experiments confirm that UDTs tend to outperform MDTs on these datasets, which can be explained by the factors identified. Thus, the common finding that UDTs match or outperform MDTs may simply be an artifact of standard benchmarks rather than an inherent advantage, and practitioners should consider correlation and decision boundary complexity when choosing between UDTs and MDTs. Overall, the paper provides useful insights into understanding the tradeoffs between these two decision tree variants.
