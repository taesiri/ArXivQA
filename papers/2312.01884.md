# [Correlation and Unintended Biases on Univariate and Multivariate   Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01884)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes the performance differences between univariate decision trees (UDTs), which use axis-parallel splits, and multivariate decision trees (MDTs), which use oblique splits. Through experiments on synthetic data, the authors find that feature correlation, complexity of the decision boundary, and label noise impact the relative performance. Specifically, MDTs perform better with high feature correlation and oblique decision boundaries, while UDTs are more robust to label noise. The paper then analyzes 57 standard benchmark datasets, finding they are biased towards low feature correlation and approximatively axis-parallel decision boundaries. Experiments confirm that UDTs tend to outperform MDTs on these datasets, which can be explained by the factors identified. Thus, the common finding that UDTs match or outperform MDTs may simply be an artifact of standard benchmarks rather than an inherent advantage, and practitioners should consider correlation and decision boundary complexity when choosing between UDTs and MDTs. Overall, the paper provides useful insights into understanding the tradeoffs between these two decision tree variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the relative performance of univariate and multivariate decision trees, finding that common benchmark datasets are biased towards low feature correlation and axis-parallel decision boundaries, favoring univariate decision trees, even though multivariate trees can perform better given sufficient feature correlation and non-axis-parallel decision boundaries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper analytically compares univariate and multivariate decision trees (DTs), and identifies a bias in standard dataset pre-processing practices that favors univariate DTs. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, the paper shows that:

1) Feature correlation, decision boundary complexity, and label noise impact the relative performance of univariate vs multivariate DTs. In particular, in the absence of noise, multivariate DTs perform better than univariate DTs when there is feature correlation and the decision boundary is oblique. 

2) Standard benchmark datasets used to evaluate DT learning algorithms are biased towards having low feature correlation and approximatively axis-parallel decision boundaries.

3) The above biases transfer to biased evaluation results that favor univariate DTs over multivariate DTs. The paper advises practitioners to check for these biases before choosing between univariate and multivariate DTs.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying biases that impact the relative evaluation of univariate and multivariate DTs, through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. This provides guidance to practitioners on making an informed choice between the two types of DTs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Decision trees (DTs) - The paper focuses on comparing univariate and multivariate decision trees. This includes concepts like split functions, axis-parallel vs oblique splits, etc.

- Univariate DTs vs Multivariate DTs - The two main families of decision trees compared. Univariate DTs use axis-parallel splits, while multivariate use oblique splits. 

- Feature correlation - The correlation between input features is analyzed as a key factor impacting the relative performance of univariate and multivariate DTs.

- Benchmark datasets - The paper analyzes potential biases in standard benchmark datasets used to evaluate decision tree algorithms.

- Performance metrics - Accuracy, F1 score, AUC, and Average Precision are used to compare the predictive performance of the different decision tree variants. 

- Model complexity - Complexity factors like tree size and number of non-zero split coefficients are also analyzed.

- Noise, decision boundary slope - Along with correlation, these factors are identified as impacting the relative performance of univariate vs. multivariate decision trees.

In summary, the key concepts revolve around understanding the factors that affect the performance of different decision tree variants, especially univariate vs. multivariate, using empirical analysis on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that standard benchmark datasets used to evaluate decision tree algorithms are biased. What specific biases were identified in the datasets and how were these biases quantified?

2. The paper introduces a method to estimate the slope angle of the decision boundary between features in a dataset. Explain this method and discuss its limitations in accurately determining if a decision boundary is oblique or axis-parallel. 

3. The paper categorizes datasets into 3 groups based on if multivariate decision trees (MDTs) outperform univariate decision trees (UDTs), if UDTs outperform MDTs, or if their performance is comparable. What thresholds were used to determine these groups and what were the key characteristics of datasets in each group?

4. One of the key findings is that UDTs tend to overfit on datasets with higher noise levels compared to MDTs. Explain why this occurs from a theoretical standpoint and discuss any assumptions made in this analysis.  

5. The experiments on synthetic datasets suggest performance gaps between UDTs and MDTs decrease as label noise increases. Propose an experiment on real-world noisy datasets to test this finding.  

6. Aside from feature correlation and decision boundary slope, what other dataset characteristics may impact the relative performance between UDTs and MDTs? Propose additional experiments to test new hypotheses.

7. The paper argues benchmark datasets are preprocessed to remove correlation. Discuss the implications of this finding in terms of assessing algorithm fairness and recommendations for curating balanced benchmark datasets.  

8. One limitation of the study is that optimal decision trees were not included due to computational constraints. Propose an experimental framework that would allow evaluation with optimal decision trees.

9. The paper relies largely on predictive performance metrics to compare UDTs and MDTs. Discuss other evaluation criteria, such as interpretability, that could reveal further insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

10. The key conclusion is that claims of univariate decision trees consistently outperforming multivariate decision trees may not generalize beyond biased datasets. Discuss the broader implications of this finding in terms of developing more robust and reliable machine learning systems.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decision trees (DTs) are commonly used classification models that are interpretable and accessible. There are two main types - univariate DTs (UDTs) with axis-parallel splits, and multivariate DTs (MDTs) with oblique splits. 
- MDTs are more expressive in theory, but in practice UDTs consistently show comparable performance. The reasons behind this are not well understood.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) Analyze impact of feature correlation, decision boundary complexity, label noise on UDTs vs MDTs:
- Construct synthetic datasets with controlled correlation, boundary slope, noise 
- MDTs outperform UDTs without noise and oblique boundary; gap grows with correlation  
- With noise, UDTs mostly outperform, as MDTs overfit
- On real datasets, MDT wins linked to higher correlation and slope  

2) Benchmark datasets have bias favoring UDTs:
- Very low feature correlation after typical preprocessing  
- Decision boundaries mostly "axis-parallel"

3) Bias in datasets leads to biased performance assessment:  
- Across 57 datasets, UDTs outperform MDTs
- On subset with higher correlation, slope, MDTs win
- Can explain UDT wins via biases identified earlier

Key conclusions:
- Correlation, slope, noise impact relative UDT/MDT performance
- Low correlation, axis-parallel splits bias datasets to favor UDTs  
- Practitioners should not conclude UDTs always superior

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis on why UDTs match MDTs despite lower expressiveness, identifies previously overlooked dataset biases, and warns against biased conclusions to always prefer UDTs.
