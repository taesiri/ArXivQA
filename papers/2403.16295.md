# [LexDrafter: Terminology Drafting for Legislative Documents using   Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing number of legislative documents in the EU containing many domain-specific terms and definitions. 
- Manually drafting new legislative documents is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies in terminology usage. 
- There is a need for harmonized definitions across regulations to avoid ambiguities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents LexDrafter, a framework to assist in drafting Definitions articles in legislative documents. 
- It uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and existing definitions from legislative documents to suggest definitions on demand while drafting a new document.

Main Components:
- Document Corpus: Contains properly extracted and preprocessed texts of EU legislative acts.
- Definition Corpus: Contains identified definition elements - terms, explanations, and citation references.

Workflows:
1. Build the corpus from EU legal acts by extracting texts and identifying definition elements. 
2. When drafting a new document, for a term selected by user, find existing definitions in corpus to cite, or use RAG to generate a new definition using retrieved contextual fragments and a large language model.

Key Contributions:  
- Semi-automates the drafting process for Definitions articles to reduce time and human errors.
- Aims to harmonize definitions across regulations for consistent terminology.
- Evaluated definition generation using BLEU, BERTScore and BLEURT to measure quality.

Ongoing Work: 
- Automatically identify terms needing definitions.
- Expand to legal documents across all domains in EU regulations.

In summary, LexDrafter demonstrates the potential of using AI to make legislative drafting more efficient while enhancing quality and consistency of terminology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents LexDrafter, a framework that assists in drafting Definitions articles for legislative documents by identifying existing definitions or generating new ones for selected terms using retrieval augmented generation and existing term definitions from different legislative documents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting LexDrafter, a framework that assists in drafting Definitions articles for legislative documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and existing term definitions present in different legislative documents. Specifically, LexDrafter aims to:

1) Harmonize legal definitions across different legal acts by automating the drafting of Definitions articles. This ensures consistency in how terms are defined across regulations.

2) Reduce human errors in drafting by providing existing term definitions for citation or generating new definitions. 

3) Reduce time-consumption in drafting by allowing users to easily identify existing definitions or generate new ones instead of manually searching through legislation.

In summary, LexDrafter focuses on the terminology drafting task, i.e. generating Definitions articles in legislative documents, using an information retrieval system combined with RAG and large language models. The main innovation is in applying RAG to legal text generation to improve consistency and efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- legal
- EU legislative documents
- EUR-Lex
- retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) 
- large language models (LLMs)
- text generation
- definitions
- terminology drafting
- harmonized legal definitions
- document corpus
- definition elements

The paper focuses on assisting with drafting definitions and terminology in EU legislative documents from the EUR-Lex platform. It utilizes retrieval-augmented generation and large language models to generate definitions and harmonize terminology across documents. The key components include building a document corpus and definition elements from EUR-Lex, and using those to identify existing definitions or generate new ones for selected terms. So the keywords reflect this focus on EU legal documents, text generation, definitions and terminology drafting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to generate definitions for terms in legislative documents. How does RAG combine parametric and non-parametric memory to generate text? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?

2. The LexDrafter framework realizes two key workflows - building the document and definition corpus, and identifying/generating definitions. What are the main components involved in each workflow and how do they interact with each other?

3. Definition elements are a key concept that capture terms, explanations, and references. What is the motivation behind having references in the definition elements? How does the CiteResolver component function to populate these references?  

4. What document model does the paper assume? How is a document structured into sections and paragraphs? Why is preserving this hierarchy important when building the document corpus?

5. When identifying definitions to build the definition corpus, what patterns does the DefExtract component look for? Why is having a separate Definitions article important according to the Joint Practical Guide?  

6. When no definition exists for a term, how does the RAG-based approach generate one? What is the prompt structure and information passed to the LLM? Why specify a word range for the definition?

7. Two LLMs are experimented with - LLaMA-2 and Vicuna. What metrics are used to evaluate quality of generated definitions? Why does Vicuna perform better than LLaMA-2?

8. What are some challenges/limitations faced when extracting legal definitions from documents? How does the paper address definitions that do not follow expected patterns?

9. How suitable is BLEURT for evaluating quality of definitions from a legal perspective? What solution does the paper propose for improving BLEURT scores?

10. What are some real-world applications/benefits of using LexDrafter? How can it assist harmonization of definitions across regulations and avoid ambiguities?
