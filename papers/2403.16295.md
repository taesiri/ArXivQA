# [LexDrafter: Terminology Drafting for Legislative Documents using   Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing number of legislative documents in the EU containing many domain-specific terms and definitions. 
- Manually drafting new legislative documents is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies in terminology usage. 
- There is a need for harmonized definitions across regulations to avoid ambiguities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents LexDrafter, a framework to assist in drafting Definitions articles in legislative documents. 
- It uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and existing definitions from legislative documents to suggest definitions on demand while drafting a new document.

Main Components:
- Document Corpus: Contains properly extracted and preprocessed texts of EU legislative acts.
- Definition Corpus: Contains identified definition elements - terms, explanations, and citation references.

Workflows:
1. Build the corpus from EU legal acts by extracting texts and identifying definition elements. 
2. When drafting a new document, for a term selected by user, find existing definitions in corpus to cite, or use RAG to generate a new definition using retrieved contextual fragments and a large language model.

Key Contributions:  
- Semi-automates the drafting process for Definitions articles to reduce time and human errors.
- Aims to harmonize definitions across regulations for consistent terminology.
- Evaluated definition generation using BLEU, BERTScore and BLEURT to measure quality.

Ongoing Work: 
- Automatically identify terms needing definitions.
- Expand to legal documents across all domains in EU regulations.

In summary, LexDrafter demonstrates the potential of using AI to make legislative drafting more efficient while enhancing quality and consistency of terminology.
