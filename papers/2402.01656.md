# [Promises and pitfalls of artificial intelligence for legal applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are exaggerated claims about AI replacing lawyers and revolutionizing the legal profession. However, evaluating the usefulness of AI for legal tasks is challenging.
- The paper categorizes legal applications of AI into three types: information processing, tasks involving creativity/reasoning/judgment, and predictions about the future. These tasks vary in how easy they are to evaluate.

Information Processing: 
- Easier to evaluate since there are clear right/wrong answers and the relevant information is observable. 
- Generative AI leads to evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes as it builds on prior natural language processing systems. Impact on laypeople using these tools is unclear.  
- Issues like hallucinations limit reliability for deployment.

Creativity/Reasoning/Judgment:
- Harder to evaluate due to lack of clear right/wrong answers. These tasks would lead to bigger impacts if automated.
- Evaluations can suffer from contamination, lack of construct validity, and prompt sensitivity.
- Recommendations include involving legal experts, developing naturalistic evaluations, communicating limitations clearly, and using AI narrowly where outcomes are well-defined.

Predictions: 
- Prediction of court outcomes rarely actually tests prediction ability. When tested properly, accuracy is low.
- Predictive AI for decisions like recidivism also has low accuracy. Issues like distribution shift further limit reliability.
- Predictive applications lack observability of relevant features.

Overall, the difficulty in evaluating legal applications of AI varies. Caution must be exercised in deploying AI, especially for prediction tasks. Evaluations should shift from technical assessments to socio-technical analysis in context.
