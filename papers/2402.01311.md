# [Deep Multimodal Fusion of Data with Heterogeneous Dimensionality via   Projective Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal medical imaging, combining data from different imaging modalities, can improve diagnosis and treatment of diseases compared to using a single modality. 
- Existing deep learning methods for multimodal image analysis are limited to fusing data of the same dimensionality (e.g. 3D+3D or 2D+2D). They cannot handle heterogeneous dimensionality (e.g. 3D+2D) which is often needed in medical imaging.
- Existing classification methods that combine heterogeneous data discard spatial information during fusion, making them unsuitable for localization tasks like segmentation.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel framework for fusing multimodal data of heterogeneous dimensionality that retains spatial information, enabling localization tasks like segmentation.
- The framework extracts features from each modality and projects them into a common feature space, enabling joint processing.
- Two fusion approaches proposed: Late Fusion and Multiscale Fusion.
- Late Fusion concatenates the output feature maps from separate encoder-decoders for each modality. 
- Multiscale Fusion uses separate encoders for each modality but a shared decoder, with skip connections bringing encoder features to multiple levels of the decoder.

Contributions:  
- First framework to enable fusing of multimodal medical images with heterogeneous dimensionality while retaining spatial information needed for localization tasks.
- Demonstrated significant improvement over state-of-the-art monomodal methods in segmentation tasks for two clinical applications: geographic atrophy (retinal disease) and retinal blood vessels. 
- Up to 3.1% and 4.64% increase in Dice score over monomodal methods for the two tasks.
- Proposed framework is flexible and can be applied to variety of modalities, tasks and number of modalities.
