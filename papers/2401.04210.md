# [FunnyNet-W: Multimodal Learning of Funny Moments in Videos in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Understanding and detecting "funny moments", or the moments that elicit laughter, in video is a challenging task for machines. This is because comedy often relies on complex cultural and language cues across multiple modalities like audio, visuals, and text. Prior works have mostly relied on text from subtitles as the main cue. However, subtitles may not always be available, and audio and visuals also contain important signals. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes FunnyNet-W, a multimodal model to detect funny moments in videos using the naturally available modalities - audio, visual frames, and automatically generated text from speech. The model consists of encoders for processing audio, video and text, which are fused together using a novel Cross-Attention Fusion module. This learns to correlate features across modalities in a hierarchical manner. The model is trained using a combination of supervised classification loss to predict funniness, and an self-supervised contrastive loss that encourages representations from different modalities to be embedded in a common space. Funny moments are automatically labeled by detecting laughter in the audio.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes FunnyNet-W, a novel approach using audio, video and automatically generated text to detect funny moments without manual annotations.
2) Introduces a Cross-Attention Fusion module to hierarchically fuse multimodal features using self- and cross- attention.
3) Achieves state-of-the-art results on 5 datasets - outperforming prior arts that use ground truth subtitles.
4) Demonstrates the capability to run "in the wild" using raw videos without any manual supervision.
5) Provides extensive experiments analyzing the contribution of each modality and model component.

In summary, this paper presents a novel framework FunnyNet-W that can automatically detect funny moments in raw videos by effectively combining multimodal signals. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FunnyNet-W, a multimodal model that combines audio, visual, and textual features extracted directly from videos to detect funny moments without requiring manual annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces FunnyNet-W, a multimodal model for funny moment detection that uses audio, visual, and textual modalities that come automatically with videos. FunnyNet-W combines features from the three modalities using a proposed Cross-Attention Fusion (CAF) module relying on cross and self-attention.

2. Extensive experiments and analysis highlight that FunnyNet-W successfully exploits audio, visual and textual cues. FunnyNet-W achieves state-of-the-art results on five datasets. 

3. The paper demonstrates the generalizability of FunnyNet-W by comparing it to automatic LLM chatbots and showcases its flexibility through in-the-wild applications like replacing real speech with synthetic speech.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of FunnyNet-W, a multimodal funny moment detection model that can leverage modalities that naturally come with videos without needing manual annotations. Experiments show it outperforms previous methods and analysis provides insights into how it exploits different modalities.

The paper proposes a multimodal model called FunnyNet-W for detecting funny moments in videos using audio, visual, and textual cues. It relies on speech-to-text and large language models to process the textual modality automatically extracted from videos. The model is trained using self-supervised contrastive learning and a novel cross-attention fusion module. An unsupervised laughter detection method is also proposed to obtain labels for training data. The key focus is on leveraging multiple naturally available modalities from videos to understand humor and funny moments without manual annotations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an unsupervised approach to detect laughter and use it as labels for training. What are the main steps of this unsupervised laughter detection approach? What are its advantages and limitations compared to supervised approaches?

2. The Cross Attention Fusion (CAF) module is a key component of the proposed FunnyNet-W architecture. Explain in detail how the cross-attention and self-attention blocks in CAF allow fusing information from the different modalities. What are the benefits compared to prior cross-modal fusion approaches?

3. The paper argues that relying solely on textual cues is insufficient for detecting funny moments in videos. What is the evidence presented that supports the superiority of a multimodal approach using audio, visual and text? What are the complementary cues provided by each modality?

4. What audio features are most useful for identifying funny moments according to the analysis in the paper? Explain the importance of real vocals compared to synthesized speech. How do background sounds and music contribute? 

5. What failure cases does the analysis identify for FunnyNet-W? How could the model be improved to address subtle, sarcastic humor and jokes relying on long-term context? Would additional modalities help?

6. How were the textual features generated in a completely unsupervised way to allow "in the wild" application? What is the impact on performance compared to using ground truth subtitles? Could this approach generalize to other languages?

7. The experiment comparing FunnyNet-W with LLMs using various prompt engineering strategies is very insightful. Summarize the key findings. What opportunities exist for improving LLM performance on this task?  

8. Discuss the differences between FunnyNet from ACCV 2022 and the proposed FunnyNet-W. What changes were made to the architecture and why? How did the performance improve?

9. The paper demonstrates wide applicability by testing on data from various domains beyond sitcoms. Discuss some examples showcasing the generalization capacity. What are remaining limitations?

10. From an ethical perspective, what are potential positive and negative societal impacts of technologies for automated funny moment detection? How could FunnyNet-W be made more inclusive and unbiased?
