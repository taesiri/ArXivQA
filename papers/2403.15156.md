# [Infrastructure-Assisted Collaborative Perception in Automated Valet   Parking: A Safety Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15156)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of limited perception reliability in Automated Valet Parking (AVP) systems caused by severe occlusions in parking garages. Two typical safety-critical scenarios are identified: 1) a pedestrian crossing the road behind a parked vehicle, and 2) two vehicles unaware of each other at an occluded T-junction. To guarantee safety, vehicles must drive very slowly, negatively impacting parking garage efficiency.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an infrastructure-assisted Collaborative Perception (CP) system where roadside sensors provide additional perceptual data to connected vehicles via NR-V2X communication. A BEV feature-based CP network is presented that takes camera/LiDAR data from vehicles and infrastructure as inputs. It uses encoders to transform data into a unified BEV representation which is then adaptively fused. Feature compression techniques like autoencoders, downsampling, sparsification and quantization are applied to fit within NR-V2X bandwidth constraints.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes a BEV feature-based CP architecture for infrastructure-assisted AVP that handles multi-source, multi-modality data.
2) Introduces techniques to effectively compress BEV features for transmission over bandwidth-limited NR-V2X.  
3) Evaluates infrastructure CP in simulations of two safety-critical parking garage scenarios. Shows CP increases max safe speed by up to 3m/s, improving efficiency.

In summary, the paper presents an infrastructure-assisted, BEV feature-based CP system for AVP to address perception reliability issues caused by occlusions. Evaluation in simulated safety-critical scenarios shows CP enables increased vehicle speed while maintaining safety.
