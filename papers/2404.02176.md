# [Versatile Navigation under Partial Observability via Value-guided   Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional autoregressive planning methods for navigation face two key limitations: 1) they lack foresight as they select actions sequentially based only on the previous state, making them poorly suited for long-horizon tasks, and 2) they require large amounts of data to learn effective policies, which is impractical to obtain in 3D navigation scenarios. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a versatile diffusion-based approach for trajectory-level plan generation that can effectively navigate complex, long-horizon partially observable environments in both 2D and 3D. 

- The approach consists of two main components:
  1) A diffusion policy module that generates full action trajectories simultaneously conditioned on partial environment maps, providing more foresight.
  2) A value guidance module that incorporates state estimation and computes a value function via QMDP to guide goal-directed exploration and avoid obstacles, without needing expert demonstrations.

- For 3D navigation, the approach projects 3D point clouds onto 2D grids using semantic segmentation, allowing zero-shot transfer of policies trained on 2D data to 3D test environments.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a diffusion-based planning approach for partially observable environments that generates entire action trajectories with ample foresight.

- Incorporates value guidance to enable goal-directed exploration and dead end avoidance without expert supervision. 

- Achieves effective policy transfer from 2D training environments to 3D test scenes via point cloud projection, overcoming 3D data scarcity.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both 2D grid worlds and 3D embodied navigation datasets, outperforming strong autoregressive and behavior cloning baselines.

- Shows impressive robustness against different visibility constraints and sensor noise levels.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in long-horizon partially observable planning by combining the strengths of diffusion models and value functions, while also enabling zero-shot 2D-to-3D transfer to tackle data scarcity, leading to versatile navigation policies applicable to varied realistic settings.
