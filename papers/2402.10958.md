# [Relative Preference Optimization: Enhancing LLM Alignment through   Contrasting Responses across Identical and Diverse Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10958)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in aligning with diverse user preferences and values, especially in nuanced contexts.  
- Methods like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback are resource-intensive.  
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns models directly using preference pairs but is limited to identical prompts.

Proposed Solution - Relative Preference Optimization (RPO):
- Constructs a contrastive matrix with preferred and rejected responses from identical and semantically related prompts.  
- Applies prompt-aware reweighting to emphasize preferences from related prompts.
- Handles both paired and unpaired preference data.  
- Loss function promotes preferred responses and demotes rejected responses based on weighted contrasts.

Key Contributions:
- Novel contrastive learning approach that considers relative preferences across related prompts, mirroring human learning.  
- High adaptability - works with both paired and unpaired preference data.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DPO on dialogue, summarization, and AlpacaEval2.0 benchmarks when tested on models like LLama and Mistral.

In summary, RPO advances LLM training through an innovative contrastive preference optimization strategy that achieves superior alignment with nuanced human preferences by leveraging insights from both identical and semantically related prompts.
