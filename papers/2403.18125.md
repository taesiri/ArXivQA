# [For those who don't know (how) to ask: Building a dataset of technology   questions for digital newcomers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18125)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Many people struggle to gain competency with digital technology due to barriers that prevent them from asking clear and appropriate questions. These barriers include unfamiliar terminology, lack of context, and anxiety. Existing large language models (LLMs) and chatbots do not adequately address these issues. It is unclear how nonstandard language queries affect LLM outputs.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose creating a dataset of questions from digital newcomers, compiled from 3 sources:
1) Mining existing online forums like Yahoo Answers
2) Tapping into records of tutor-learner sessions from the BASIC program 
3) Recording and annotating new tutoring sessions at libraries 

The dataset will capture unclear questions along with clarification strategies from tutors. It will be used to research how question wording impacts LLM factuality and train classifiers to detect learner competency from questions. The authors also propose integrating pedagogical strategies from human tutoring into LLM chatbots to create an automated tutoring system.

Main Contributions:
- Dataset of questions from digital newcomers containing imprecise language
- Analysis of how unclear questions impact LLM factuality 
- Classifiers to determine learner competency from questions
- Integration of human tutoring strategies into LLM chatbots for automated tutoring

The proposed dataset and analysis will further research into digital literacy education and conversational educational agents. The project involves collaboration with local libraries to understand real learner needs.
