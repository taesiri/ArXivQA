# Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: Do larger neural network language models exhibit abilities that cannot simply be extrapolated from smaller models? In other words, as language models are scaled up in size, do they gain qualitative improvements in capabilities beyond just quantitative improvements in performance on existing tasks?The paper refers to such qualitative changes in capabilities as "emergent abilities". The key hypothesis is that emergent abilities exist - i.e., larger neural network language models can demonstrate skills that smaller models entirely lack, even if the smaller models are evaluated on the same tasks. The authors aim to provide evidence for this hypothesis and categorize different types of emergent abilities that have been observed.In summary, the paper sets out to investigate whether scaling up the size of neural network language models leads to more than just incremental performance gains, but wholly new abilities, and seeks to provide examples of such emergent phenomena from prior work. The central research question is whether emergent abilities can arise from simply increasing model scale.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper surveys and discusses the concept of "emergent abilities" of large language models. The key points are:- Emergent abilities refer to capabilities that are not present in smaller models, but emerge in larger models as scale increases. They manifest as sharp performance improvements at a certain scale threshold, rather than gradual improvements.- Emergence is demonstrated across various settings - few-shot prompting, reasoning tasks, calibration, etc. Specific examples discussed include arithmetic, following instructions, reasoning over multiple steps, and answering questions truthfully. - Emergence is not fully explained by existing scaling laws. The paper discusses potential explanations like model size needed to capture certain knowledge, but more research is needed on the mechanisms behind emergence.- Emergence shows the potential for further discoveries as models continue to scale up. However, model scale alone does not fully determine capabilities - factors like model architecture and training techniques also play a role.- The paper frames emergent abilities as an important open research direction to understand and anticipate the capabilities of future large language models. Key questions include why emergence occurs, how to predict emergent behaviors, and how to unlock new abilities earlier at smaller scale.In summary, the main contribution is a conceptual framing and survey of emergent abilities in large language models, highlighting this phenomenon as an important research direction going forward.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper discusses the phenomenon of emergent abilities in large language models, where new capabilities arise in larger models that are not present or predictable from smaller models. The key takeaway is that further scaling up of models may lead to new emergent abilities that we cannot anticipate now.
