# [Enhanced Coherence-Aware Network with Hierarchical Disentanglement for   Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the task of aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA), which includes detecting aspect categories in text and classifying their sentiments. Two key issues are identified with existing methods: 
1) They mainly use intra-sentential features and fail to leverage inter-sentential contexts and coherence of the full review. As a result, some implicitly mentioned categories and sentiments are missed. 
2) Multiple aspect categories and sentiments can be entangled within a sentence, but methods fail to disentangle them.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Enhanced Coherence-Aware Network (ECAN) with the following main components:

1) Coherence modeling using XLNet to capture cross-sentence coherence and assist in identifying implicit aspects/sentiments. A contrastive learning loss ensures coherent reviews get higher scores.

2) Hierarchical disentanglement with parallel attention to explicitly disentangle both categories and sentiments within sentences into distinct representations. 

3) Word-level syntactic learning via graph convolutions to enhance local sentiment semantics.

4) Multi-task objective for coherence scoring, category detection and sentiment classification.

Main Contributions:

- Novel architecture to leverage both cross-sentence coherence and hierarchical disentanglement of categories/sentiments within sentences for improved ACSA.

- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art results on multiple ACSA datasets, with especially significant gains in sentiment classification. 

- Analysis demonstrating the impact of disentanglement and the ability to explicitly focus on different categories/sentiments.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in ACSA by effectively utilizing both cross-sentence coherence and disentanglement of fine-grained category/sentiment representations within sentences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an enhanced coherence-aware network with hierarchical disentanglement of aspect categories and sentiments to improve aspect-category sentiment analysis by modeling document-level coherence and decoupling multiple entangled categories and sentiments within sentences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(1) Proposing an enhanced coherence-aware network (ECAN) that leverages coherence modeling to learn explicit opinions from contexts and helps identify implicit aspects and sentiments for the aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task. 

(2) Proposing a hierarchical disentanglement module to extract distinct category and sentiment features to address the issue of multiple entangled aspect categories and sentiments within sentences.

(3) Demonstrating through extensive experiments and visualization that ECAN effectively disentangles categories and sentiments in the coherence representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for both the aspect category detection and aspect-category sentiment classification tasks.
