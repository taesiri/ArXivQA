# [Enhanced Coherence-Aware Network with Hierarchical Disentanglement for   Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the task of aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA), which includes detecting aspect categories in text and classifying their sentiments. Two key issues are identified with existing methods: 
1) They mainly use intra-sentential features and fail to leverage inter-sentential contexts and coherence of the full review. As a result, some implicitly mentioned categories and sentiments are missed. 
2) Multiple aspect categories and sentiments can be entangled within a sentence, but methods fail to disentangle them.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Enhanced Coherence-Aware Network (ECAN) with the following main components:

1) Coherence modeling using XLNet to capture cross-sentence coherence and assist in identifying implicit aspects/sentiments. A contrastive learning loss ensures coherent reviews get higher scores.

2) Hierarchical disentanglement with parallel attention to explicitly disentangle both categories and sentiments within sentences into distinct representations. 

3) Word-level syntactic learning via graph convolutions to enhance local sentiment semantics.

4) Multi-task objective for coherence scoring, category detection and sentiment classification.

Main Contributions:

- Novel architecture to leverage both cross-sentence coherence and hierarchical disentanglement of categories/sentiments within sentences for improved ACSA.

- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art results on multiple ACSA datasets, with especially significant gains in sentiment classification. 

- Analysis demonstrating the impact of disentanglement and the ability to explicitly focus on different categories/sentiments.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in ACSA by effectively utilizing both cross-sentence coherence and disentanglement of fine-grained category/sentiment representations within sentences.
