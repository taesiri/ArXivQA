# [Disordered-DABS: A Benchmark for Dynamic Aspect-Based Summarization in   Disordered Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Aspect-based text summarization has seen advances, but summarizing large, unstructured texts like social media remains challenging. 
- Existing methods depend on predefined aspects and don't handle dynamic topics and non-coherent texts well.
- There is a need for methods that can identify aspects dynamically and summarize disjointed texts.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce the Disordered Aspect-Based Summarization (DABS) benchmark, specifically designed for dynamic summarization of unstructured texts.  
- DABS contains two datasets automatically adapted from existing summarization datasets: D-CNNDM (news) and D-WikiHow (encyclopedia).
- The datasets have over 250K aspect-oriented summary examples, with shuffled sentences to add disorder and complexity.

Contributions:
- First dataset focused on dynamic summarization of unstructured, multi-source texts.
- Detailed analysis reveals state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.5 still struggle with DABS, showing much room for improvement.  
- Comprehensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate DABS poses new challenges related to dynamic topics, sentence disorder, and clear aspect identification.
- Proposed benchmark drives progress in aspect-based summarization of complex real-world text sources.

In summary, the paper presents DABS, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamic summarization of unstructured texts across changing topics and disjointed sentences. Experiments show current models fail to handle DABS effectively, indicating significant research potential in this complex summarization task.
