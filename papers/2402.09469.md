# [Fourier Circuits in Neural Networks: Unlocking the Potential of Large   Language Models in Mathematical Reasoning and Modular Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper studies how neural networks and Transformers learn to perform modular addition on multiple inputs, i.e. $(a_1+\dots+a_k)\bmod p$.
- This is a complex algebraic task that requires some form of logical reasoning and mathematical understanding. 
- The goal is to analyze why networks adopt certain computational strategies and representations when trained on this task using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Key Contributions
- The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the features learned by one-hidden layer neural networks for modular addition with $k$ inputs.
- It shows these networks attain maximum margin when each neuron corresponds to a Fourier feature characterized by a distinct frequency.  
- Specifically, when the width $m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1)$, the network achieves maximal $L_{2,k+1}$ margin of $\gamma^*=2(k!) / (2k+2)^{(k+1)/2}(p-1) p^{(k-1)/2}$.
- This indicates neural networks have an intrinsic bias towards Fourier-based circuits for solving problems involving cyclic groups.
- Empirical evaluations validate the theory - networks train Fourier features even without explicit regularization.
- Similar computational mechanisms are also observed in the attention matrices of Transformers, revealing parallels in how they learn.
- As the number of inputs $k$ increases, the "grokking" phenomenon where models abruptly transition from poor to perfect generalization is diminished.

In summary, the paper makes significant strides in unraveling the operational complexity of neural networks and Transformers for mathematical reasoning, specifically in adopting Fourier methods for modular arithmetic problems. The integration of theoretical and empirical findings provides valuable insights into these models' underlying learning processes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper theoretically and empirically shows that neural networks and Transformers trained with stochastic gradient descent on the problem of modular addition with multiple inputs learn to solve it by adopting Fourier-based computational circuits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Expansion of Input for Cyclic Groups Problem: The paper extends the input parameter range for the cyclic groups problem from a binary set to k-element sets. 

2. Network's Maximum Margin: The paper demonstrates that for the modular dataset D_p, the maximum L_{2,k+1}-margin of a network is given by a specific formula involving k, p and some constants.

3. Neuron Count in One-Hidden-Layer Networks: The paper proposes that in the general case, a one-hidden-layer network with m ≥ 2^{2k-2} · (p-1) neurons can achieve the maximum L_{2,k+1}-margin solution.  

4. Empirical Validation of Theoretical Findings: The paper validates the theoretical finding that when m ≥ 2^{2k-2} · (p-1), for each spectrum ζ, there exists a hidden-neuron that utilizes this spectrum.

5. Similar Empirical Findings in One-Layer Transformer: The paper also observes similar computational mechanisms related to Fourier spectra in the attention matrix of Transformers.

In summary, the main contribution is an analytical characterization of the features learned by neural networks and Transformers for modular addition involving k inputs, validated by empirical results.
