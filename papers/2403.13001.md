# [Fundamental Components of Deep Learning: A category-theoretic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13001)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using category theory to provide a mathematical foundation for deep learning. What are some of the key advantages of using category theory compared to more traditional mathematical frameworks for studying deep learning? How does it allow expressing ideas in a more uniform way?

2. The paper emphasizes modeling neural networks as parametric weighted optics with an intricate "three-legged" shape representing inputs, outputs and parameters. What aspects of neural networks does this specific construction elegantly capture compared to other proposed categorical models? How does it aid conceptual clarity?  

3. The paper defines a new concept called an "additively closed cartesian left-additive category". What properties must a category satisfy in order to meet this definition? Why is this construction important for modeling derivatives and differentiation of neural network layers? 

4. Explain the abstract formulation of backpropagation presented in the paper using lenses and the key concepts involved. What components does it encapsulate? How does it allow changing underlying spaces or parameters in a systematic way?

5. The formalism presented allows compositional specification of diverse neural network architectures. Pick two distinct architectures from convolutional, recurrent, recursive etc. and explain how they could be expressed categorically. What are the objects, morphisms and composition rules involved?  

6. The paper emphasizes operational aspects of implementing bidirectional systems. Explain the key differences outlined between gradient checkpointed and non-checkpointed reverse mode automatic differentiation. What facets do the respective categorical constructions capture?

7. The formulation of supervised learning combines components like models, optimisers and loss functions. Explain how the update rule presented compactly captures propagation of various signals. How are parameters, predictions, ground truths etc. represented?

8. Compare and contrast the proposed formulation of supervised learning to existing categorical accounts in the literature. What enhancements does defining it as a base change of the parametric construction allow?  

9. The construction of weighted optics separates various components like forward/backward categories, residuals etc. What benefits does such separation provide when analyzing space/time tradeoffs for instance? Give examples.

10. What open questions or limitations exist when it comes to applying the proposed constructions towards analyzing emerging deep learning concepts like in-context learning, scaling laws, architecture search etc.? What enhancements could address these gaps?
