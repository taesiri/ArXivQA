# [Action Scene Graphs for Long-Form Understanding of Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03391)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Egocentric Action Scene Graphs (EASGs), a new graph-based representation for long-form understanding of egocentric videos. EASGs model the temporal evolution of actions performed by the camera wearer, encoding the involved objects, their relationships, and how the actions unfold over time. The authors collect EASG annotations by extending the Ego4D dataset through a multi-stage annotation procedure and provide statistics showing the datasets capture diverse daily activities. They establish baseline results for the task of EASG generation using a model to predict graph components given visual input. Experiments demonstrate that EASGs enable more effective performance on long-term egocentric video understanding tasks of action anticipation and activity summarization compared to the standard verb-noun representation. The annotated dataset and code are released to facilitate further research into graph-based modeling of egocentric video for long-form activity understanding.
