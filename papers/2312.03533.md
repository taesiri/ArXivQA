## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new computational problem called Low-shot Object Learning with Mutual Exclusivity Bias (LSME). LSME aims to model the learning strategy commonly observed in young children, where they leverage "mutual exclusivity bias" to rapidly learn the names of novel objects from limited examples. Specifically, when toddlers encounter a scene with both familiar and unfamiliar objects, and hear a new word, they associate that word with the unfamiliar object - ruling out objects they already know names for. The authors formally define the LSME problem which involves localizing objects in a scene, using mutual exclusivity to identify the novel object and bind it with a new word label, and then generalizing to classify new instances of that category. A data generation pipeline is introduced that can create LSME datasets by rendering 3D object models. Experiments show that combining state-of-the-art vision models with multi-view self-supervised pretraining provides a strong baseline for LSME, but there is still substantial room for improvement. The authors argue that solving LSME could significantly advance computational models of human word learning.
