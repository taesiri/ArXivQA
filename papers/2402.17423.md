## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Reinforced In-Context Black-Box Optimization":

Problem:
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms aim to optimize objective functions where no analytic expressions or derivatives are available. Traditional BBO algorithms like Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics and solve problems from scratch, resulting in slow convergence and inability to leverage structures in optimization problems. Recently, there has been interest in meta-learning components of BBO algorithms from data, but learning the entire algorithm end-to-end requires the least expert knowledge and provides maximum flexibility. Prior end-to-end learned algorithms require gradient information or online sampling during training, which is impractical for BBO.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Reinforced In-Context Black-Box Optimization (RIBBO) to learn an entire BBO algorithm end-to-end from offline datasets. RIBBO uses a causal transformer model to fit optimization histories produced by multiple behavior algorithms on multiple BBO tasks. The model takes query points and function values as input, and is trained to predict the distribution over the next query point. 

Additionally, RIBBO augments histories with "regret-to-go" (RTG) tokens representing future cumulative regret, enabling the model to correlate trajectories with regret and generate sequences satisfying a user-specified regret. During inference, RIBBO employs a "hindsight regret relabeling" strategy to update RTG tokens, encouraging optimal decisions while keeping RTG values meaningful.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes RIBBO, the first end-to-end learned BBO algorithm from offline data without needing gradient information or online sampling
- Integrates regret-to-go tokens to identify algorithms, correlate trajectories with regret, and reinforce performance  
- Achieves universally good performance across diverse BBOB, HPO and robot control problems, sometimes surpassing the best behavior algorithm
- Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of RTG conditioning and the proposed relabeling strategy
