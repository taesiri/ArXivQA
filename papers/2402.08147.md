# [Verified Multi-Step Synthesis using Large Language Models and Monte   Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate code, but the code often contains errors and needs to be inspected or regenerated. 
- Generating verified code in languages like Dafny, Lean or Coq is challenging as it requires specifications, code, and proofs of correctness.
- Humans currently need to put significant effort into guiding LLMs to generate fully verified code.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a method called VMCTS that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and LLMs to incrementally generate verified code.  
- At each step, VMCTS uses the LLM to suggest extensions to partial programs. The extensions are checked by an automated verifier, and only valid extensions are added to the MCTS search tree.  
- The verifier acts as an evaluation function, assigning scores to nodes based on validity of partial solutions, pruning invalid branches.
- Versus sampling complete solutions, VMCTS finds valid solutions faster by exploring promising branches guided by the verifier.

Key Contributions:
- Definition of VMCTS algorithm that combines MCTS and LLM for multi-step verified code generation.
- Demonstration that VMCTS enables weaker LLMs to solve complex verified programming problems that cannot be solved by naive sampling.  
- Results on a benchmark of 13 problems showing VMCTS succeeds in 11/13 cases within 10 minutes, compared to only 3/13 for naive sampling.
- Competitive performance to ChatGPT augmented with plugins and step-by-step guidance.
- Analysis of variants like diversity promotion, verifier feedback to LLM, and fine-tuning on verifier preferences.

In summary, the paper presents a novel MCTS approach to effectively guide LLMs to generate fully verified code, reducing human effort. Experiments demonstrate efficiency and reliability gains over baseline approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method called VMCTS that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide large language models to generate verified programs in languages like Dafny, Lean, and Coq by leveraging feedback from the language's verifier at each step to steer the search process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting an approach using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate verified programs in Dafny, Lean and Coq. Specifically, the paper proposes an algorithm called VMCTS that leverages the verifier inside the search process by checking partial programs at each step. By combining the LLM's ability to generate code suggestions with the verifier's ability to evaluate code correctness, VMCTS is able to enhance the program synthesis capabilities of open source LLM models on a set of benchmark verified programming problems. The paper also explores variations of VMCTS, such as ensuring diversity in code completions, providing verifier feedback in context to guide the LLM, and fine-tuning the LLM using verification outcomes. Overall, the key contribution is introducing a novel symbolic algorithm combining MCTS with LLMs and verifiers for verified program synthesis.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- LLMs (Large Language Models) - The paper focuses on using large pre-trained language models to generate verified code and proofs.

- MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) - A search algorithm that is combined with LLMs to guide the exploration of the space of partial programs towards finding a complete verified solution. 

- Dafny - A verification-aware programming language that the LLMs generate code in, along with proofs of correctness.

- Coq - Another verification-aware programming language used.

- Lean - Yet another verification-aware language used.

- Verified programming - The goal is to synthesize programs along with formal proofs that the code meets specifications and functions correctly.

- Partial programs - Incomplete code snippets that are scored and evaluated throughout the search process.

- VMCTS - The proposed algorithm that integrates MCTS with an LLM and verifier feedback.

- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) - A reinforcement learning method used to fine-tune the LLM based on verifier feedback.

So in summary, the key terms cover the LLMs, MCTS search algorithm, verified programming languages, partial program synthesis, the VMCTS approach, and methods to learn from verifier feedback.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel symbolic algorithm that combines multi-step synthesis with MCTS. How does this algorithm differ from prior work that has used MCTS for program synthesis? What modifications were made to the traditional MCTS framework?

2. The paper leverages both a large language model (LLM) and a program verifier in its proposed algorithm. What is the specific role of each component? How do they complement each other? 

3. The expansion and evaluation steps of MCTS were modified in the proposed VMCTS algorithm. Can you explain the verification and backtracking strategies used in expansion? How does the algorithm leverage the verifier as a value function during evaluation?

4. What is the motivation behind using a variant of MCTS instead of standard MCTS or simply relying on the LLM's generative capabilities? What benefits does the search process provide even with a powerful prior?

5. How does the defined MDP formulation aid the MCTS process for verified program synthesis? What do the states, actions, transitions and rewards represent?

6. Several variations of the core VMCTS algorithm are discussed, including diversity, in-context learning, and fine-tuned learning. Can you summarize the motivation and approach for each? What results were shown?

7. The scoring function assigns a score of +1, 0 or -1 to denote verified incomplete programs, unverified programs, and refuted programs, respectively. What are the limitations of relying solely on this coarse granularity? 

8. The paper alternate between leaving the specification to the LLM versus explicitly imposing the interfaces and specs. What are the tradeoffs? When would you use each approach?

9. The results show that VMCTS outperforms whole program sampling substantially. However, the success rate is still comparable to that of ChatGPT. Why is this the case? What could be potential areas of improvement?

10. If you were to extend this work, what directions seem most promising? What other techniques could complement the synergistic approach of combining LLMs with formal verification?
