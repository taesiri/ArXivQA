# [Verified Multi-Step Synthesis using Large Language Models and Monte   Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate code, but the code often contains errors and needs to be inspected or regenerated. 
- Generating verified code in languages like Dafny, Lean or Coq is challenging as it requires specifications, code, and proofs of correctness.
- Humans currently need to put significant effort into guiding LLMs to generate fully verified code.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a method called VMCTS that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and LLMs to incrementally generate verified code.  
- At each step, VMCTS uses the LLM to suggest extensions to partial programs. The extensions are checked by an automated verifier, and only valid extensions are added to the MCTS search tree.  
- The verifier acts as an evaluation function, assigning scores to nodes based on validity of partial solutions, pruning invalid branches.
- Versus sampling complete solutions, VMCTS finds valid solutions faster by exploring promising branches guided by the verifier.

Key Contributions:
- Definition of VMCTS algorithm that combines MCTS and LLM for multi-step verified code generation.
- Demonstration that VMCTS enables weaker LLMs to solve complex verified programming problems that cannot be solved by naive sampling.  
- Results on a benchmark of 13 problems showing VMCTS succeeds in 11/13 cases within 10 minutes, compared to only 3/13 for naive sampling.
- Competitive performance to ChatGPT augmented with plugins and step-by-step guidance.
- Analysis of variants like diversity promotion, verifier feedback to LLM, and fine-tuning on verifier preferences.

In summary, the paper presents a novel MCTS approach to effectively guide LLMs to generate fully verified code, reducing human effort. Experiments demonstrate efficiency and reliability gains over baseline approaches.
