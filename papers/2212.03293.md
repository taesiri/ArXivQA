# [Diffusion-SDF: Text-to-Shape via Voxelized Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03293)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to effectively generate 3D shapes from text descriptions using implicit representations. Specifically, the paper focuses on developing a generative framework based on implicit signed distance fields (SDFs) that can synthesize high-quality and diverse 3D shapes matching given text descriptions. The key hypotheses are:- Implicit SDF representation is more suitable for representing flexible 3D shapes compared to explicit representations like meshes or voxels.- Diffusion models can be adapted to generate high-quality and diverse implicit SDF representations for 3D shapes from text descriptions. - A two-stage approach with a patch-based SDF autoencoder and a voxelized diffusion model can better capture local shape structures and generate shapes conforming to text.- The proposed UinU-Net architecture can help reconstruct patch-independent SDF representations by combining patch-focused inner network with outer U-Net capturing global contexts.So in summary, the main research question is how to generate diverse, high-quality 3D shapes from text using implicit SDFs and diffusion models. The key hypotheses focus on the benefits of SDF, diffusion models, two-stage generation, and the UinU-Net architecture for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework called Diffusion-SDF for text-to-shape synthesis based on voxelized signed distance fields (SDFs). The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a two-stage pipeline with a patch-based SDF autoencoder followed by a Voxelized Diffusion model to generate high-quality and diverse 3D shapes from text descriptions. - Designing a novel UinU-Net architecture for the diffusion model's denoiser that implants an inner network focused on local patches inside a U-Net backbone to better recover the independent patch representations.- Achieving promising results on generating and manipulating 3D shapes conditioned on text, including text-to-shape generation, text-guided shape completion, and text-guided shape manipulation.- Outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches for text-to-shape generation on metrics like IoU, classification accuracy, CLIP similarity, and diversity.In summary, the main contribution is presenting a new Diffusion-SDF framework that combines a patch-based SDF autoencoder with a Voxelized Diffusion model using a custom UinU-Net denoiser to achieve high-quality and diverse text-to-shape synthesis based on implicit SDF representations. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on text-to-shape tasks.
