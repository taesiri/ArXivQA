## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called D3IL for domain-adaptive imitation learning using visual observations. The key idea is to extract domain-independent behavior features from images through dual feature extraction and dual cycle consistency. Specifically, the method employs domain encoders and behavior encoders in both source and target domains to extract mutually exclusive domain and behavior features. It also adopts generators to reconstruct images from the features and impose image-level and feature-level cycle consistency for enhanced feature extraction. Experiments on various domain shift scenarios demonstrate superior performance over previous methods. The approach is useful when obtaining demonstrations or solving tasks directly via reinforcement learning in the target domain is challenging. Through both quantitative metrics and qualitative trajectory visualizations, the results validate that the method can effectively leverage expert knowledge from one domain to train agents for tasks in another domain with different dynamics, embodiments, and observations.
