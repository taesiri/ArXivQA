# [Exploring Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Target Tracking using   Micro Aerial Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17552)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) like quadrotors need the capability to autonomously track moving targets while maintaining visibility constraints (e.g. keep the target in the camera field of view). However, their dynamics are highly nonlinear and uncertain, making this a challenging control problem.

- Model-based control methods require accurate dynamic models which are difficult to obtain for MAVs due to uncertainties from aerodynamic effects, sensor noise, delays, etc. They also need full state information which requires either motion capture systems (limited to specific environments) or complex onboard estimation (prone to errors).

- Learning-based approaches like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have emerged as an alternative but most focus only on performance rather than robustness. The few works on robust DRL control have been limited to state feedback instead of the output feedback case relevant to the visual tracking problem.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes a DRL-based robust nonlinear output feedback controller for MAV target tracking using only relative position data from onboard sensors. 

- It employs domain randomization during training to improve robustness w.r.t parametric uncertainties like mass mismatches and input delays. Specifically, gain and delay margins are randomized akin to their use as robustness indicators in control theory.

- Reward shaping accounts for tracking error, control effort, velocities and collision avoidance constraints. The DRL policy maps target position outputs to low-level actuator commands in an end-to-end manner without needing a separate attitude control loop.

Contributions:
- Novel DRL-based nonlinear output feedback controller for MAV target tracking with visibility constraints, using only relative position data

- First approach to combine ideas of gain/delay margins from control theory with domain randomization to improve robustness of learned policies

- Extensive simulations demonstrating precise tracking across wide range of uncertainties and comparison to a baseline LQG controller confirming superior robustness.

In summary, this paper presents a systematic DRL method to learn nonlinear robust control policies for vision-based MAV tracking. The experiments confirm high performance and robustness, outperforming classical model-based designs in off-nominal conditions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach to design a robust nonlinear output feedback controller for micro aerial vehicles to track a moving target while maintaining visibility, and shows through simulations that it outperforms a baseline linear quadratic Gaussian controller in off-nominal scenarios with uncertainties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a systematic approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to design a nonlinear output feedback control law for target tracking problems with visibility requirements. The control law relies only on relative position data from onboard sensors.

2) Making the learned DRL policy robust against parametric uncertainties such as mass mismatches and time delays, by exploiting classical robustness indicators like gain and phase margins during training. 

3) Extensively evaluating the DRL policy in simulation, comparing it to a baseline design with feedback linearization and LQG control. The DRL controller significantly outperforms the baseline in numerous off-nominal scenarios with noise, disturbances, and unseen trajectories.

In summary, the key contribution is using DRL to learn a robust nonlinear controller for MAV-based target tracking from output feedback, with experimental validation demonstrating improved performance over a model-based baseline under uncertainties. The method relaxes assumptions of full state feedback and knowledge of target trajectories.

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn a robust output feedback control policy for target tracking using MAVs.

The method only relies on relative position measurements, relaxing common assumptions on full state feedback. The key terms reflect this focus on using deep RL for robust vision-based aerial target tracking.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach for robust target tracking using micro aerial vehicles. How does this approach differ from traditional model-based control techniques for target tracking? What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages compared to model-based methods?

2) The paper exploits classical robustness indicators like gain and phase margins during the learning process via domain randomization. Why is this an effective strategy to improve robustness? How do these margins relate to common sources of uncertainty that affect micro aerial vehicles? 

3) The deep reinforcement learning agent is trained using a customized asymmetric actor-critic framework. What is the motivation behind using an asymmetric architecture instead of a standard actor-critic? How does this choice impact the sample efficiency and final performance of the learned policy?

4) The reward function incorporates several terms related to tracking error, control effort, velocity and collisions. What is the rationale behind each of these terms? How do they balance performance versus safety and feasibility during training? How sensitive is the learned behavior to changes in the reward function weights?

5) What impact does the length of the observation sequence in eq. (5) have on the tracking accuracy and robustness of the learned policy? What trade-offs need to be considered when selecting the sequence length H?

6) The simulation environment used for training differs from the more complex validation environment. What effect does this mismatch have and why is it an effective strategy? How does this domain randomization compare to other approaches for sim-to-real transfer of learned policies?

7) Table I shows significantly better performance of the DRL controller compared to LQG in off-nominal scenarios. What causes this improved robustness? How well would the DRL approach generalize to more severe uncertainties not seen during training?

8) The DRL agent has access to less information than the LQG controller which has full state and attitude data. Despite this, the DRL approach achieves comparable or better performance. Why does the learned policy succeed given less input data?

9) The tracking algorithm uses only onboard relative position data as input. How suitable would this approach be for vision-based tracking relying only on camera images? What changes would be needed to implement the DRL policy using raw image data instead?

10) For real-world implementation, how feasible is deploying the proposed deep learning architecture for online control on embedded hardware with limited compute resources? What optimizations could improve the compute performance and reduce latency of the learned policy?
