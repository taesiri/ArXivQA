# [Imbalanced Data Clustering using Equilibrium K-Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14490)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Imbalanced data, where data points are unevenly distributed across clusters, poses challenges for traditional clustering algorithms like K-means and fuzzy K-means. These algorithms have a "uniform effect" which causes centroids to crowd together in large clusters, resulting in clusters of equal size even when the true clusters are imbalanced.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a new algorithm called equilibrium K-means (EKM) to address this issue. 

- EKM is derived from a novel framework called smooth K-means, which unifies hard K-means, fuzzy K-means and EKM by approximating the within cluster sum of squares with a smooth minimum function.

- In EKM, centroids are updated based on a Boltzmann distribution, which introduces appropriate repulsive forces between centroids. This prevents centroids from crowding in large clusters.

- The membership formula in EKM also has a clearer physical meaning based on Boltzmann distribution compared to fuzzy K-means.  

Main Contributions:

- Provides a unifying framework for K-means style algorithms based on smooth approximations of the within cluster sum of squares objective. This allows easier comparison and analysis.

- Derives the equilibrium K-means algorithm which significantly outperforms other techniques on imbalanced data by reducing the uniform effect.

- Shows that K-means algorithms can be viewed as gradient descent or Newton's method on the smoothed objectives. 

- Demonstrates strong performance of EKM on various synthetic and real-world imbalanced datasets from different domains.

- Shows that deep clustering performance on imbalanced data can be improved by over 35% simply by replacing hard K-means with EKM in the clustering layer of deep neural networks.

In summary, the key idea is to use appropriate repulsive forces between centroids to counter the uniform effect, which is naturally achieved in EKM through the Boltzmann distribution. This makes EKM suitable for clustering challenging imbalanced datasets.
