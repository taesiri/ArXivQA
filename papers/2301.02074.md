# [Test of Time: Instilling Video-Language Models with a Sense of Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02074)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can video-language models be instilled with a better sense of time to improve their understanding of temporal concepts and relations in videos?

In particular, the authors propose a method called "Test of Time" to adapt video-language models to better align predicted timestamps of events with ground truth timestamps. The key ideas are:

- Introducing a temporal contrastive loss during model finetuning to encourage alignment between predicted and ground truth timestamps. 

- Using a curriculum learning strategy that gradually increases the difficulty of the temporal alignment task during training.

- Evaluating the adapted models on downstream tasks like temporal grounding and temporal ordering that require temporal understanding.

The overarching hypothesis is that using the Test of Time approach to adapt models will improve their temporal reasoning abilities as quantified through metrics on downstream tasks. The experiments aim to validate whether Test of Time can instill video-language models with an improved sense of time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a method to instill video-language models with a sense of time. Specifically, the authors introduce a temporal consistency loss and temporal relevance loss to enforce temporal coherence and relevance when adapting video-language models to new domains. They show through experiments that adding these losses during domain adaptive pre-training leads to improved performance on downstream temporal reasoning tasks compared to models adapted without any temporal losses. The key ideas appear to be:

- Introducing losses to enforce temporal coherence (consistency between predicted timestamps for the same event) and relevance (alignment between predicted timestamps and textual descriptions) during adaptation.

- Demonstrating improved temporal common sense and reasoning abilities with models adapted using these losses, through experiments on temporal ordering, duration prediction, and temporal language understanding tasks.

- Showing that temporal losses are crucial for temporal reasoning abilities specifically during domain adaptive pre-training, compared to using them only during downstream finetuning.

In summary, the main contribution is a methodology to inject video-language models with temporal common sense through additional temporal losses during domain adaptation, leading to models with improved temporal reasoning and understanding.
