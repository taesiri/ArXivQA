# [Test of Time: Instilling Video-Language Models with a Sense of Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02074)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can video-language models be instilled with a better sense of time to improve their understanding of temporal concepts and relations in videos?

In particular, the authors propose a method called "Test of Time" to adapt video-language models to better align predicted timestamps of events with ground truth timestamps. The key ideas are:

- Introducing a temporal contrastive loss during model finetuning to encourage alignment between predicted and ground truth timestamps. 

- Using a curriculum learning strategy that gradually increases the difficulty of the temporal alignment task during training.

- Evaluating the adapted models on downstream tasks like temporal grounding and temporal ordering that require temporal understanding.

The overarching hypothesis is that using the Test of Time approach to adapt models will improve their temporal reasoning abilities as quantified through metrics on downstream tasks. The experiments aim to validate whether Test of Time can instill video-language models with an improved sense of time.
