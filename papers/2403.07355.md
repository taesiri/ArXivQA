## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In FDD massive MIMO systems, accurate CSI feedback from UE to BS is critical but challenging due to huge overhead. Recently, DL-based CSI feedback methods using autoencoder framework have been proposed to compress and reconstruct CSI. 

- However, existing works rely on scalar quantization of latent vector, which ignores correlations among entries. Also, at least 1 bit per entry is needed, restricting latent dimension.

- VQ-VAE methods adopt vector quantization for finite-bit representation of latent vector. But they require comparing distances between latent vector and all codewords, incurring huge complexity. Also, design of vector codebook is not explored.

Proposed Solution: 
- Proposes DL-based CSI feedback method using VQ-VAE framework with shape-gain vector quantization to reduce complexity. Magnitude and direction of each latent sub-vector quantized separately using gain and shape quantizers.  

- For gain quantization, non-uniform scalar quantizer based on clipped μ-law transformation adopted. For shape quantization, Grassmannian codebook with unit-norm vectors trained.  

- Beyond single-rate design, multi-rate codebook strategy introduced. Nested codebook constructed by successively reducing size. New codeword selection rule and revised loss function proposed.

Main Contributions:
- Reduces complexity of VQ-VAE by separating shape and gain quantization of latent vectors. Scalar quantizer for gain, Grassmannian codebook for shape.

- Further improves performance under fixed overhead by designing vector codebook, unlike existing works. 

- Supports multi-rate quantization with single nested codebook via new codeword selection and loss function.

- Simulation shows proposed method reduces complexity significantly and outperforms existing methods under same overhead. Multi-rate codebook brings additional gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a deep learning-based channel state information feedback method for massive MIMO that uses shape-gain vector quantization of the latent vector within a vector-quantized variational autoencoder framework to reduce complexity while improving reconstruction performance under limited feedback overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a finite-rate deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback method for massive MIMO systems, which utilizes the vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Designing the codebook for VQ-VAE based on shape-gain vector quantization, which separates quantizes the magnitude (gain) and direction (shape) of the latent vector. This alleviates the computational complexity of the original VQ-VAE approach.

2) For gain quantization, adopting a non-uniform scalar codebook using a clipped μ-law transformation to capture the behavior of the latent vector's magnitude. 

3) For shape quantization, employing a trainable Grassmannian codebook under the unit-norm constraint to quantify the direction of the latent vector.

4) Developing a multi-rate codebook design strategy to support multi-rate vector quantization using a single codebook. This involves a codeword selection rule for a nested codebook along with a revised loss function design.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a computationally-efficient finite-rate CSI feedback method using VQ-VAE and shape-gain vector quantization, along with a multi-rate codebook design.
