# [Generative Action Description Prompts for Skeleton-based Action   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05318)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:Can utilizing action language descriptions unveil semantic relations between actions and benefit skeleton-based action recognition? The key hypothesis is that incorporating generative action prompts in the form of detailed language descriptions can provide useful guidance for representation learning in skeleton-based action recognition models.The authors investigate whether generating detailed text descriptions of body part movements for different actions, and using those descriptions in a multi-modal training scheme, can enhance the learned representations and improve performance on skeleton-based action recognition tasks.Their proposed approach, called GAP (Generative Action-description Prompts), leverages a pre-trained language model to automatically generate descriptive text of body part movements. This text is then used alongside the skeleton data during training to provide additional supervision signals and align the learned representations, with the goal of capturing finer-grained semantic relations between different actions based on the generated descriptions.The central research question is whether this type of multi-modal training with generated action prompts can improve skeleton-based action recognition models compared to traditional unimodal training schemes that only use the skeleton data. The hypothesis is that the action language descriptions can unveil useful semantic relationships between different actions that provide beneficial guidance for representation learning.In summary, the key research question is whether generative action prompts can enhance skeleton-based action recognition, and the central hypothesis is that using descriptive text of body part movements can guide the model to learn improved representations compared to standard unimodal training. The paper aims to demonstrate the value of generated language descriptions for this task.
