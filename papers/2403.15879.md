# [TrustSQL: A Reliability Benchmark for Text-to-SQL Models with Diverse   Unanswerable Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent text-to-SQL models have achieved high accuracy in mapping natural language questions to SQL queries, but little is known about their reliability in handling diverse real-world questions including unanswerable ones.
- Existing works have limitations in addressing reliability holistically, only focusing on subsets like error detection or unanswerable question detection separately.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present TrustSQL, a new benchmark to assess text-to-SQL model reliability in both single-database and cross-database settings.
- The benchmark includes both answerable and diverse types of unanswerable questions, and allows models two output options - SQL prediction or abstention.
- A new reliability score metric rewards accurate SQL predictions and abstentions for unanswerable questions, while penalizing incorrect predictions and attempts to answer unanswerable questions.

Contributions:
- Construction of TrustSQL benchmark with answerable and wide range of unanswerable questions across multiple text-to-SQL datasets.
- Formulation of reliable text-to-SQL task allowing models to abstain from prediction.
- Proposition of integrated and unified modeling approaches combining answerability detection, SQL generation and error detection.
- Introduction of new reliability score metric that considers potential harm of incorrect predictions.
- Analysis showing addressing reliability in text-to-SQL is challenging and opens avenues for future work, as current methods do not outperform an abstain-all baseline.

In summary, the paper presents a new benchmark and framework to assess and improve reliability of text-to-SQL models on diverse questions, highlighting it as an important open challenge for future research.
