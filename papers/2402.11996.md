# [ISCUTE: Instance Segmentation of Cables Using Text Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11996)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Deformable linear objects (DLOs) like wires and cables are challenging for conventional computer vision techniques due to lack of distinct features like shape, color and texture. This calls for tailored DLO perception solutions, especially for tasks like robotic manipulation.
- Existing DLO instance segmentation techniques have limitations dealing with real-world complexity, lack accessible user control, and have poor generalization across datasets. 

Proposed Solution - ISCUTE:
- Combines CLIPSeg model's semantic segmentation from text prompts with SAM model's few-shot instance segmentation capability using point prompts.
- Introduces adapter model with two main components:
   1) Prompt encoder network: Converts CLIPSeg semantic mask to point prompt batches that SAM can decode into instance masks.
   2) Mask classifier network: Filters duplicate/low-quality masks from SAM using a binary classifier.
- Framework takes an image + text prompt as input and outputs per-DLO instance masks in a single forward pass.

Key Contributions:
- Rich, diverse CAD-generated DLO dataset with 30K high-res industrial images and annotations.
- Exceeds state-of-the-art DLO segmentation performance with 91.21% mIoU. 
- Strong generalization - outperforms existing methods on external datasets zero-shot without tuning.
- Text-promptable instance segmentation of DLOs to enhance user accessibility.
- Analysis reveals classifier network as current bottleneck limiting higher performance.
- Sets baseline for adapting technique to broader instance segmentation tasks using foundation models.

In summary, ISCUTE pushes state-of-the-art in DLO instance segmentation through innovations in adapting text-image foundation models, while ensuring generalization, quality and accessibility. The presented analysis and dataset are also valuable contributions.
