# [Influence of Prompting Strategies on Segment Anything Model (SAM) for   Short-axis Cardiac MRI segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08932)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper investigates the use of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for the task of cardiac MRI short-axis view segmentation. The authors explore different prompting strategies to focus SAM's attention, including bounding boxes, positive points, and negative points. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that combining positive points with either bounding boxes or negative points substantially improves segmentation performance compared to using positive points alone. However, adding all prompts simultaneously provides little additional benefit. Further experiments fine-tuning SAM on a small subset of annotated volumes indicate that proper prompting during fine-tuning leads to noticeable improvements over the baseline model. Specifically, the presence of bounding boxes has a large positive impact during fine-tuning. Overall, the results showcase prompting strategies as an effective way to specialize the general-purpose SAM model for cardiac segmentation. Simple fine-tuning provides further improvements, with bounding boxes enabling the model to learn well-defined tissue boundaries. While specialized models still outperform fine-tuned SAM given sufficient data, SAM with prompts and light fine-tuning provides a compelling off-the-shelf solution for this task.
