# [DiffSF: Diffusion Models for Scene Flow Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Scene flow estimation is an important task in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Given a source and target 3D point cloud, the goal is to estimate a dense scene flow vector field that maps each point from the source to the target. This is challenging due to sparsity and noise in real-world data as well as occlusions. While recent methods achieve reasonable accuracy on synthetic datasets, their applicability is limited by a lack of robustness and an inability to quantify uncertainty. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes DiffSF, a novel scene flow approach combining transformers and denoising diffusion models. Scene flow estimation is formulated as a diffusion process, where ground truth vectors are gradually perturbed by noise during training. The reverse process then attempts to recover the noise-free vectors from the perturbed input, conditioned on source and target point clouds. This diffusion formulation enhances robustness to noise while the sampling process enables uncertainty estimation.  

The architecture builds on prior work, using transformers to extract reliable features followed by optimal transport for scene flow computation. Multiple hypotheses are sampled during inference to quantify uncertainty without needing explicit training. Experiments validate state-of-the-art performance on FlyingThings3D, KITTI and Waymo datasets while the uncertainty correlates well with estimation errors, allowing unreliable predictions to be detected.  

Main Contributions:
- Novel transformer + diffusion architecture for robust scene flow learning
- Uncertainty estimation from diffusion process without requiring bespoke training 
- State-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks combined with prediction reliability metrics
- Analysis of uncertainty-error correspondence, enabling adjustable operating points based on application requirements

In summary, the key innovation is the application of diffusion models to scene flow leading to accuracy and robustness improvements. Additionally, the inherent stochasticity enables reliability analysis without modification during training.
