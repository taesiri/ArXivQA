# [Prompting Large Language Models with Speech Recognition Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11795)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can a large language model be equipped with speech recognition abilities by conditioning it on a sequence of audio embeddings generated from a small audio encoder?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by prepending a sequence of audio embeddings to the input text embeddings, the language model can learn to perform speech recognition in a multilingual setting. 

The paper investigates factors like the frame rate and size of the audio encoder, whether the language model needs to be fine-tuned or can be frozen, the impact of using different language models like LLaMA vs BLOOM, and adding text token masking during training. Through experiments on the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset, the authors show that their approach allows a large language model to perform multilingual speech recognition by conditioning it on audio embeddings, outperforming baseline monolingual models.

In summary, the central research question is about equipping language models with speech recognition abilities by conditioning them on audio embeddings, and the key hypothesis is that this approach can enable multilingual speech recognition performance superior to standard supervised baselines. The paper seems to provide positive evidence for this hypothesis through systematic experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to enable large language models to perform speech recognition by conditioning them on a sequence of audio embeddings generated from a small audio encoder. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Showing that by prepending a variable-length sequence of audio embeddings to the text tokens, a large language model can be converted into an automatic speech recognition system. 

- Experiments on the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate this approach allows the LLaMA-7B model to outperform monolingual baselines by 18% and perform multilingual speech recognition despite being trained mostly on English text.

- Investigating factors like audio encoder model size, frame rate and striding, low-rank adaptation of LLM parameters, text token masking, and choice of LLM that enable better speech recognition performance.

- Analyzing the audio embeddings and finding they tend to be monotonically aligned with the text tokens, indicating the LLM is performing a regurgitation task, repeating the information contained in the audio sequence.

- Showing that speech recognition is possible even when the LLM is completely frozen during training or with very large strides of almost 1 second in the audio encoder.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a simple and effective method to equip large language models with speech recognition abilities by conditioning them on audio embeddings, and analyzing different factors that improve performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper shows that attaching a small audio encoder to a large language model allows it to perform multilingual speech recognition by conditioning the LLM on a sequence of audial embeddings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The main contribution is using a large language model (LLM) for speech recognition by conditioning it on audio embeddings from a small pretrained audio encoder. This is a novel approach compared to prior work on speech recognition which has focused more on specialized acoustic and language models. 

- Using a frozen pretrained LLM is very parameter-efficient compared to jointly training the entire model, as done in some prior multimodal work like PaLM-E. The low-rank adaptation is also efficient.

- The goal of equipping the LLM with speech abilities is similar to recent work like LTU, but this paper shows stronger speech recognition capabilities and directly conditions the LLM on speech rather than training on a separate dataset.

- The multilingual speech recognition results are very strong given the simplicity of the approach and small amount of tuning. They outperform supervised baselines by a large margin. Other recent multilingual speech recognition work has used more complex pretraining objectives.

- Analyzing the learned audio-text alignments is an interesting analysis that provides some insights into why the approach works. The alignment technique is relatively simple compared to more complex methods in some prior work.

- The model architecture of conditioning the LLM on a variable-length sequence of audio embeddings is straightforward compared to papers that learn cross-modality alignment, though it seems very effective.

Overall, I would say the simplicity of the approach compared to other multimodal and speech recognition papers is a notable difference. Despite the simplicity, the method achieves strong results by effectively utilizing the knowledge and capabilities of a pretrained LLM. The efficiency and interpretability are advantages compared to many prior approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate directly training the audio encoder to align its outputs with the text tokens of the language model, rather than indirectly training alignment through next token prediction. The authors show evidence that the audio and text embeddings become aligned, so explicitly optimizing for this could improve performance.

- Explore different levels of text token masking for different amounts of language-specific training data. The authors found masking helped overall performance but hurt low-resource languages, suggesting adaptive masking strategies could help. 

- Scale up the audio encoder to have more parameters and fewer striding, as both were shown to improve results. The authors propose this as one way to enable operating on long-form audio.

- Try other large language models beyond LLaMA and BLOOM, to further analyze the impact of model scale and multilinguality.

- Evaluate the adapted models on textual downstream tasks to measure if freezing LLM parameters preserves original capabilities.

- Apply the approach to other modalities like images or video by generating variable-length embedding sequences.

- Explore other efficient ways to adapt the LLM like adapter layers instead of low-rank adaptation.

- Evaluate the models on a wider range of speech tasks beyond just speech recognition.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates equipping large language models (LLMs) with speech recognition abilities by conditioning the LLM on a sequence of audio embeddings generated by a small audio encoder. Experiments on the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset show that incorporating a conformer encoder into LLaMA allows it to outperform monolingual baselines and perform multilingual speech recognition despite being trained mostly on English text. The paper explores factors like audio encoder model size, frame rate, LLM freezing/adaptation, and masking that impact performance.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates enabling speech recognition abilities in large language models (LLMs) by conditioning the LLM on a sequence of audio embeddings generated by a pretrained audio encoder. The audio encoder converts audio to a variable length sequence of embeddings. By prepending these audio embeddings to the input text embeddings, the LLM can be converted into a speech recognition system. Experiments on the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset show that incorporating a small conformer encoder into the LLaMA LLM allows it to outperform monolingual baselines and perform multilingual speech recognition despite LLaMA being trained mostly on English text. Furthermore, ablation studies are conducted investigating factors like the stride and size of the audio encoder, using low-rank adaptation to tune the LLM, and masking the text tokens during training. The results show that good performance is possible even when the LLM is completely frozen, demonstrating the flexibility of large language models. Analysis of the audio embeddings shows they become aligned with the text tokens, supporting the view that the LLM is learning to copy information from the audio to the text.

In summary, this paper demonstrates a simple and effective approach to equip LLMs with speech recognition abilities by conditioning them on an audio embedding sequence from a small pretrained encoder. The method enables multilingual speech recognition while retaining most of the original LLM parameters frozen. Ablation studies provide insights into factors impacting performance, like using larger encoders and low-rank tuning of the LLM. Analysis reveals the audio embeddings become aligned to the text, supporting the view that the LLM learns to copy information from audio to text. The work shows the promise of conditioning large language models on variable length embedding sequences as a way to adapt them to new modalities and tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes attaching a small audio encoder to a large language model (LLM) to give it speech recognition abilities. The audio encoder generates a variable length sequence of audio embeddings that are prepended to the text token embeddings and fed into the LLM. The LLM is then trained to predict the next token conditioned on this sequence of audial embeddings. By leveraging the flexibility and generative capabilities of LLMs, this allows transforming them into automatic speech recognition systems. The method is evaluated by attaching a small conformer-based encoder to the LLaMA-7B model and evaluating on the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset. The paper investigates factors like the stride of the audio encoder, freezing/adapting the LLM parameters, the choice of LLM model, and masking the target text. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for multilingual speech recognition, outperforming monolingual baselines while keeping most LLM parameters frozen. Analyses also show the audio embeddings tend to align with the text tokens.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of extending the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform speech recognition by attaching a small audio encoder to the LLM. The key questions explored in the paper are:

- Can an LLM be conditioned on a sequence of audio embeddings to perform speech recognition without any changes to the model architecture?

- What factors enable better speech recognition performance when conditioning an LLM, such as audio encoder model size and frame rate, LLM tuning approaches, and masking of text tokens?
