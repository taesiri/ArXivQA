## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning method called CLIP-driven Zero-shot Learning for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation (CZL-CIAE) for performing zero-shot age estimation. The method first uses CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) to extract visual features from images and textual features from prompts to obtain aligned semantic embeddings. It then introduces a new Transformer architecture called Fourierformer that replaces the standard attention mechanism with Fourier transforms, enabling better spatial interaction and channel evolution of image features. The image and text features are fused in the Fourierformer for enhanced context modeling. An error correction module is also proposed that uses an ensemble method to iteratively reduce the error between the predicted and ground truth ages in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance of CZL-CIAE for zero-shot age estimation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The results showcase the benefits of leveraging CLIP for transfer learning, designing Fourier transformer blocks for representation learning, and employing error feedback for calibrated predictions.
