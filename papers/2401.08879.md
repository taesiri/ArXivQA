# [Contribution Functions for Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Graphs: A   Principle-based Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quantitative bipolar argumentation (QBA) represents arguments and their relationships numerically in a directed graph. Inferring argument strengths from such graphs is useful for explainable AI.  
- Prior work introduced "contribution functions" to quantify how one argument in a QBA graph contributes to the strength of another. But there has been no rigorous analysis of desirable properties for such functions.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce several principles that capture intuitive properties a contribution function should satisfy, such as directionality, contribution existence, faithfulness, and counterfactuality.
- Analyze four different contribution functions with respect to satisfaction of these principles across five common QBA semantics.

Key Contributions:  
- Formalization of principles for contribution functions: directionality, contribution existence, quantitative contribution existence, (quantitative) local faithfulness, (quantitative) counterfactuality
- Analysis showing which principles each contribution function satisfies for different semantics
- No function satisfies all principles, so analysis facilitates selecting the right one for an application
- Minor results/conjectures related to proximity, monotonicity, and topological constraints that may imply principle satisfaction

Overall, the paper provides a theoretical foundation for selecting and reasoning about contribution functions in quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs based on formal principles. The analysis shows tradeoffs between different functions and highlights open questions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces principles formalizing intuitions about contribution functions that quantify the influence of one argument on another in quantitative bipolar argument graphs, analyzes the satisfaction of these principles by different contribution functions with respect to various argumentation semantics, and identifies unique principle satisfaction properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) It introduces and formally defines four different contribution functions to quantify the influence of one argument on the final strength of another argument in a quantitative bipolar argumentation graph (QBAG). The four functions are: removal-based, intrinsic removal-based, Shapley value-based, and gradient-based contribution.

2) It proposes several principles that a contribution function should intuitively satisfy, such as directionality, contribution existence, local faithfulness, and counterfactuality. These principles formalize expectations and intuitions about how a contribution function should behave. 

3) It provides a comprehensive, principle-based theoretical analysis of the four introduced contribution functions with respect to the proposed principles and five common argumentation semantics. It identifies which functions satisfy or violate which principles under which semantics through formal proofs and counterexamples.

4) The analysis serves as a rigorous framework and tool to guide the selection of the most appropriate contribution function based on the requirements and semantics used in a particular application of quantitative bipolar argumentation.

In summary, the main contribution is a rigorous, principle-based analysis framework for contribution functions in quantitative bipolar argumentation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Quantitative argumentation
- Explainable AI
- Automated reasoning
- Contribution functions
- Principle-based analysis
- Quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs (QBAGs)
- Argumentation semantics
- Directionality principle
- Stability principle
- Contribution existence principle
- Faithfulness principle
- Counterfactuality principle

The paper introduces different "contribution functions" to quantify the influence of one argument on another in a quantitative bipolar argumentation framework. It then analyzes these functions based on a set of principles, both previously proposed and newly introduced, that formalize desired properties and behaviors of such functions. The analysis considers different argumentation semantics and how the principles are satisfied or violated. The keywords reflect this focus on explaining and analyzing quantitative argument graphs through contribution functions and principles.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces four different contribution functions (removal-based, intrinsic removal-based, Shapley value-based, and gradient-based) to quantify how arguments in a quantitative bipolar argument graph (QBAG) contribute to each other. Can you explain the key differences in how each method calculates contributions? What are the advantages and limitations of each?

2. The paper defines several principles that capture desirable behaviors for contribution functions, like directionality, contribution existence, and counterfactuality. Why are these principles important for assessing and selecting an appropriate contribution function? Can you think of any other principles that may be useful to consider?  

3. The analysis shows that no single contribution function satisfies all principles across the semantics surveyed. What are some of the core trade-offs and incompatibilities between principles uncovered through the analysis? How might an application utilize the analysis to select the most suitable contribution function?

4. The Shapley value-based contribution function is shown to be the only one satisfying the quantitative contribution existence principle. Why does this function, but none of the others, satisfy this principle? What intuition or mathematical property enables this?

5. The analysis relies heavily on modular semantics that propagate strength values iteratively through a QBAG. How exactly do such modular semantics work? Can you walk through an example computation showing the iterative update process? 

6. Several counterexamples are provided showing violation of the strong faithfulness principle. What aspects of QBAGs and semantics lead to these violations? When can we expect an argument's effect on a topic argument's strength to be non-monotonic?  

7. The proximity principle codifies the intuition arguments closer to a topic argument should contribute more absolutely. Why does the analysis show violations of this principle are prevalent? Can you think of any special cases where it may hold?

8. Can the methods and analysis be extended to cyclic QBAGs? What additional complications need to be addressed? Do you think all of the principles still make sense for cyclic graphs?

9. How difficult is it to compute the different contribution functions? What is the time complexity for each, as a function of the number of arguments? Are there opportunities toapproximate the values efficiently?  

10. How might the contribution functions and analysis extend to other quantitative argumentation frameworks besides QBAGs? Could similar ideas apply to probabilistic argumentation, ranking-based semantics, etc.? What modifications would need to be made?
