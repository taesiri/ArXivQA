# [DECIDER: A Rule-Controllable Decoding Strategy for Language Generation   by Imitating Dual-System Cognitive Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01954)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for constrained text generation often greedily focus on target words themselves during decoding, lacking high-level reasoning and control over the generation process. However, humans tend to follow implicit rules and commonsense logic when constructing utterances, not just the targets. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called \modelname{} that introduces rule-based control into the decoding process of pre-trained language models (PLMs). It is inspired by dual-system theory from cognitive science, consisting of an intuitive system (PLM) and a logical system (rule-based reasoner).

The logical reasoner implements the high-level System 2 using first-order logic rules over knowledge graphs. It parses user-defined rules into parse trees and proves whether words meet the rules by recursive traversal. This produces a logic vector indicating satisfying words.

The decision function then explicitly models the interplay between the intuitive and logical systems. It shifts the PLM's next-word distributions towards words that both have high probability according to the PLM and meet the logic rules. This injection happens at each decoding step.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel rule-controllable decoding strategy \modelname{} that guides text generation through high-level logical rules instead of just target words.

- Implements the framework based on dual-system theory, with an intuitive PLM and an explicit logical reasoner. Models interplay through a decision function.

- Logic reasoner incorporates both first-order rules and knowledge graphs to evaluate variable rules. Computed logic vectors shift distributions.

- Demonstrates strong performance over competitive baselines on CommonGen and PersonaChat tasks. Rule-based control leads to more human-like and commonsensical generation.
