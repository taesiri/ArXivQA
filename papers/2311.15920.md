# [A Fully Data-Driven Approach for Realistic Traffic Signal Control Using   Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15920)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes D2TSC, a novel data-driven framework for realistic traffic signal control using offline reinforcement learning. The key innovation lies in developing a reward inference model that leverages traffic flow theory and Gaussian process interpolation to reliably estimate queue length and delay-based rewards from coarse-grained intersection data collected in the real world. Based on the inferred rewards, the authors further propose a sample-efficient offline RL algorithm tailored to the traffic signal control problem that directly optimizes signal timing policies from historical offline datasets. Through customized state encoding, action space design, and data augmentation schemes, the offline RL method achieves superior performance despite limited real-world data. Extensive experiments on a highly realistic testbed demonstrate that D2TSC outperforms competitive baselines like conventional traffic engineering methods and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. The proposed framework requires only coarse-grained data without reliance on inaccurate simulators, offering an end-to-end paradigm for deployable traffic signal control that bridges the gap between theory and practice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a fully data-driven reinforcement learning framework called D2TSC for realistic traffic signal control that uses a novel reward inference model and sample-efficient offline RL to enable policy learning directly from limited historical coarse-grained traffic data without requiring a simulator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing D2TSC, a fully data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for realistic traffic signal control (TSC) that enables simulator-free and deployment-friendly policy learning using only coarse-grained real-world TSC data. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) A novel reward inference model that combines traffic flow theory and Gaussian process interpolation to reliably estimate queue length and delay-based rewards directly from coarse-grained real-world TSC data, addressing the lack of fine-grained data for reward definition in real systems.

2) A sample-efficient offline RL method tailored for TSC problems, which enables stable policy optimization using limited historical intersection data. It incorporates phase information modeling and data augmentation techniques to further boost sample efficiency.  

3) Extensive experiments on customized simulation environments using real-world data demonstrating the capability of D2TSC to outperform conventional and offline RL baselines. The proposed framework shows great potential and superiority for being deployed to real-world systems.

In summary, the key innovation lies in developing a completely simulator-free, data-driven framework that only leverages coarse-grained data from real-world systems to enable RL-based traffic signal optimization, which has not been achieved in prior works and constitutes a major step towards deploying RL for real-world TSC.
