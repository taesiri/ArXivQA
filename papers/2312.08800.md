# [Evaluating Large Language Models for Health-related Queries with   Presuppositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08800)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the factual accuracy and consistency of large language models (LLMs) like InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat when answering health-related queries that contain varying degrees of presuppositions. The authors source a set of 1,779 verified health claims, pose them as questions to LLMs, and check if the LLM responses agree or disagree with claims using an entailment model. They find that while models rarely contradict true claims, they often fail to refute false ones - InstructGPT agrees with 32% of false claims, ChatGPT 26%, and BingChat 23%. As presuppositions in queries increase, agreements with claims also increase regardless of veracity, especially for InstructGPT and ChatGPT. When demands presume falsehoods and request evidence to support them, InstructGPT agrees 76% of the time, ChatGPT 62%, and BingChat 28%. Overall accuracy is low and consistency across presupposition levels is poor. The authors conclude that the inability of models to reliably correct false assumptions calls for careful assessment before deployment in high stakes scenarios like healthcare.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are integrated into search engines and other critical services, it is important that they provide factually accurate and robust responses. This is especially critical for health-related queries, where inaccurate information could cause harm. However, LLMs may fail to consistently refute false assumptions and could potentially reinforce misinformation. 

Methodology:
The authors evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of InstructGPT, ChatGPT and BingChat on health-related queries with varying degrees of presupposition. They introduce a dataset called UPHILL with 8895 queries derived from fact-checked claims, with presupposition levels ranging from neutral to strong. They check if model responses agree/disagree with true/false claims using an entailment model.

Key Findings:
- Factual accuracy is concerningly low, with false claims supported in 26-32% of responses. Accuracy drops with increasing presupposition.  
- InstructGPT is most sensitive to presuppositions; BingChat most robust due to retrieval grounding.
- For strongest presupposition level demanding evidence for false claims, up to 76% InstructGPT responses, 62% ChatGPT responses and 28% BingChat responses agree to support the false claim.
- InstructGPT is least consistent (25%), ChatGPT moderately consistent (39%), BingChat most consistent (61%) across presupposition levels.

Main Contributions:  
- Quantify factual accuracy of LLMs for health queries and their robustness to presuppositions
- Introduce dataset UPHILL for evaluating presupposition handling 
- Analysis of different models shows concerning gaps in accuracy and consistency, calling for careful assessment before deployment in high-stakes scenarios

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces UPHILL, a dataset of health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions, to evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of large language models including InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat. The key finding is that while models rarely disagree with true health claims posed as questions, they often fail to challenge false claims, with the problem exacerbating as presuppositions in the queries strengthen.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new dataset called UPHILL for evaluating large language models on health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. The dataset contains 8895 health-related queries with 5 different levels of presuppositions.

2. It evaluates the factual accuracy and consistency of three conversational models - InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat - on the UPHILL dataset. The key findings are:

- Factual accuracy is moderate for true claims (66-87%) but lower for false claims (51-63%). Problematically, the models often agree with false claims. 

- Agreement with claims, even false ones, increases with higher presupposition levels, especially for InstructGPT and ChatGPT.

- InstructGPT is most sensitive to presuppositions while BingChat is most robust, possibly due to retrieval augmentation.

- Consistency across presupposition levels is low, with BingChat again being the most consistent.

3. The paper discusses implications of different model designs on factual accuracy and consistency, and provides insights into the limitations of current models for high-stakes scenarios like health queries.

In summary, the main contribution is a rigorous evaluation benchmark and analysis highlighting gaps in the capabilities of large language models when handling queries with presuppositions, especially in the important health domain.

The paper evaluates the factual accuracy and consistency of large language models like InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat on health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. It introduces a new dataset called UPHILL to analyze how these models respond when presuppositions in the prompts change. The key findings are that while models rarely contradict true health claims, they often fail to challenge false claims. The paper calls for careful assessment of using LLMs for high-stakes scenarios like health search.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the UPHILL dataset for evaluating large language models on health-related queries with presuppositions. What were the key considerations and steps involved in sourcing the health claims and constructing the dataset? How was the dataset validated?

2. The paper proposes using an entailment model as a proxy for evaluating the agreement between the model's response and the claim contained within the query. What were the different entailment models experimented with? What was the process followed for evaluating and validating the entailment models on human annotations?

3. The paper categorizes the queries into 5 levels based on the degree of presupposition. Can you explain the key differences across these levels? What templating approach was used for query generation? What were some of the challenges faced?

4. The evaluation metrics used include factual accuracy and consistency. Can you explain how these metrics are formally defined? What were some of the implementation challenges and design choices made? 

5. The results indicate differences in performance across InstructGPT, ChatGPT and BingChat. What are some of the key architectural differences between these models that could potentially explain the results?

6. The paper indicates lower factual accuracy for false claims compared to true claims across models. What are some potential reasons and error analyses done to explain this gap? Were there differences in the types of false claims that models performed poorly on?

7. The results show a marked increase in agreement with false claims as presupposition levels are increased, especially for InstructGPT. Why does instruction tuning make models more prone to accepting false assumptions?

8. Qualitative analyses indicated two broad categories of errors - unconditional vs conditional acceptance of false claims. What are some examples provided in the paper for each? Are there other insightful categories discovered through manual analyses?

9. The paper discusses implications of various design choices of models on robustness to presuppositions. What architectural modifications are hypothesized to make models more robust? What future research directions are outlined?

10. The limitations section indicates that model evaluations focused on response-level accuracy. What would a more fine-grained claim-level analysis potentially reveal? How can the public dataset and annotations released enable further analyses?
