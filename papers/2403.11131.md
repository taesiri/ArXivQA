## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent breakthroughs in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have sparked significant demand for their integration into real-world 3D applications. However, different 3D applications often necessitate diverse NeRF models with varied pipelines, leading to tedious per-task NeRF training and cumbersome trial-and-error experiments. 

Proposed Solution - Omni-Recon Framework:
This paper proposes a framework called Omni-Recon towards developing a general-purpose NeRF capable of handling diverse 3D tasks. The key capabilities include:
(1) Generalizable 3D reconstruction for instant surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. 
(2) Zero-shot multitask scene understanding of various properties like semantics and edges.
(3) Adaptability to downstream tasks like real-time rendering and scene editing.

The framework features an image-based rendering pipeline with two decoupled branches - one complex transformer-based geometry branch for accurate geometry estimation, and one lightweight appearance branch for blending weights prediction.

Main Contributions:
(1) The framework achieves state-of-the-art generalizable 3D surface reconstruction quality.
(2) It enables zero-shot scene understanding by reusing the predicted blending weights to blend properties predicted from 2D priors.
(3) It supports real-time rendering by baking the complex geometry branch into a mesh and using the lightweight appearance branch as shader.
(4) It allows easy adaptation to downstream tasks like PET tuning for better scene understanding and text-guided scene editing.

Overall, the work underscores the potential of image-based rendering pipelines in diverse real-world 3D applications, sparking advancements in future rendering pipelines.
