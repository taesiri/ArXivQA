# [Deep Neural Crossover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Deep Neural Crossover":

Problem:
- Traditional genetic algorithm (GA) crossover operators like one-point, two-point and uniform crossover rely on random selection of parental genes to create offspring. They lack a mechanism to identify and leverage correlations between genes to guide the crossover process for selecting good genes.
- Most existing crossover operators are domain-specific and not easily generalizable. There is a need for domain-independent crossover operators.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel domain-independent crossover operator called "Deep Neural Crossover (DNC)" that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn a policy for selecting good genes during crossover.

- DNC represents the probability of generating an offspring from parents as a chained factorization over each gene. It models the probability of selecting each gene sequentially conditioned on previously selected genes.

- It uses an encoder-decoder architecture with RNNs. The encoder maps parent genomes into a latent representation. The decoder outputs a probability distribution over genes from parents using a pointer network. It sequentially constructs the child genome by pointing to genes from parents based on this distribution.

- DRL is used to optimize the gene selection policy to maximize expected offspring fitness. The gene selection process is stochastic to maintain diversity.

- Two versions are proposed - basic DNC which learns online, and DNC-PT which is pre-trained on one problem instance and then applied to other instances within the domain.

Main Contributions:

- Novel domain-independent crossover operator that uses DRL to learn complex gene-gene correlations and leverage them for selecting good genes.

- First operator that identifies and utilizes arbitrary gene correlations without any biased assumptions on correlation type or gene order.

- Flexible encoder-decoder framework that can work with any genome encoding and number of parents.

- Demonstrated substantially improved performance over traditional crossover operators on two combinatorial optimization domains.

- Addresses computational expense via pre-training approach for efficient usage across problem instances within a domain.
