# Bayes' Rays: Uncertainty Quantification for Neural Radiance Fields

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to quantify the uncertainty of a pre-trained neural radiance field (NeRF) model. Specifically, the paper aims to develop a method to estimate the epistemic uncertainty in NeRF models that is theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and independent of the specific NeRF architecture. The key hypothesis is that the epistemic uncertainty in a NeRF model can be estimated by modeling spatial perturbations to the radiance field and using a Bayesian approximation to characterize the allowable perturbation space. The main contributions and results of the paper are:- Proposing a perturbation-based method called Bayes' Rays to quantify epistemic uncertainty in any pre-trained NeRF model without modifications to training or needing the original training data.- Deriving the method using a Bayesian Laplace approximation over a parametric spatial deformation field. This yields a theoretically justified uncertainty measure.- Demonstrating that the computed uncertainty field correlates well with NeRF depth error and matches costly ensembles, outperforming prior work.- Showing applications of the uncertainty field like removing reconstruction artifacts interactively.In summary, the central hypothesis is that perturbation analysis and Bayesian approximations can quantify uncertainty in NeRFs. The paper presents a novel method realizing this and provides empirical validation of its effectiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing Bayes' Rays, a post-hoc algorithm to estimate the spatial uncertainty of any pre-trained neural radiance field (NeRF) model. The key points are:- Bayes' Rays can quantify uncertainty for any NeRF architecture without needing to modify the training process. It works as a plug-and-play module after training.- It establishes a volumetric uncertainty field by modeling spatial perturbations to the radiance field and using a Bayesian Laplace approximation.- The computed uncertainty field correlates well with reconstruction errors, outperforming previous methods on key metrics. - The uncertainty can be rendered as an extra channel and used for applications like removing reconstruction artifacts from pre-trained NeRFs.- Bayes' Rays is statistically derived and does not require costly computation like sampling. It can compute the uncertainty field in little over a minute.In summary, Bayes' Rays provides a general, efficient and statistically principled way to quantify epistemic uncertainty in any pre-trained neural radiance field. This enables uses like identifying reconstruction artifacts and improving NeRF performance post-training.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points of the paper:The paper introduces Bayes' Rays, a post-hoc algorithm to estimate the spatial uncertainty of any pre-trained neural radiance field model without needing additional training or changes to the model architecture, and shows applications like removing reconstruction artifacts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on uncertainty quantification for neural radiance fields:- This paper introduces the first method to quantify epistemic uncertainty in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) using a post-hoc Laplace approximation framework. Previous methods either required changes to the NeRF training process, like ensemble learning or variational Bayesian neural networks, or used less rigorous heuristic measures of uncertainty. - The proposed method can be applied to any pre-trained NeRF, regardless of architecture, without needing the original training data. This makes it much more flexible and practical compared to methods that require modifying or retraining the NeRF model.- The spatial uncertainty field computed by this method is shown to correlate better with NeRF depth prediction error than prior art like CF-NeRF. This demonstrates it is a more statistically meaningful measure of uncertainty.- A key advantage is the low computational cost, with the uncertainty field computed in just over a minute after NeRF training, unlike ensemble or probabilistic training schemes.- The applications shown, like NeRF artifact removal, match or exceed the state-of-the-art with a simpler and faster approach compared to alternatives like Nerfbusters.- Limitations compared to other works include not capturing aleatoric uncertainty intrinsic to the data, and scaling challenges for very high resolution scenes. But overall it provides a new post-hoc, flexible, and theoretically grounded way to quantify epistemic uncertainty for NeRFs.In summary, this paper introduces a novel Laplace approximation framework for NeRF uncertainty that is statistically principled, flexible, fast and achieves strong performance on key tasks, providing both theoretical and practical advances over prior art. The post-hoc nature and computational efficiency are particularly noteworthy merits.
