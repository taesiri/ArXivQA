# [Point-Cloud Completion with Pretrained Text-to-image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10533)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage text-guided image generation models to complete partial 3D point clouds of real-world objects, including for object classes not well represented in existing 3D shape datasets? The key ideas and contributions appear to be:- Formulating 3D point cloud completion as a test-time optimization problem, avoiding the need for large 3D shape datasets for training.- Using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as a semantic prior to guide completion of missing/occluded parts of shapes.- Introducing constraints based on the input point cloud by representing the shape surface with a signed distance function and enforcing it to pass through the input points.- Careful handling of camera poses when rendering views for the text-to-image model to maintain consistency with the observed partial point cloud.- Demonstrating improved completion results compared to previous methods, especially for out-of-distribution object classes not in common shape datasets.In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that leveraging recent text-to-image models can help complete partial 3D data for a much wider variety of objects compared to relying solely on 3D training datasets. The innovations are in how to effectively combine the text prior with the geometric constraints of the partial point cloud input.
