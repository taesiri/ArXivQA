# [NeRF-Gaze: A Head-Eye Redirection Parametric Model for Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate diverse and accurate gaze data to improve gaze estimation, especially for cross-domain scenarios. 

The key points are:

- Propose a novel gaze data generation method based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that can synthesize novel views of head images and precisely control the gaze direction.

- Develop a flexible NeRF framework that can decouple the face and eyes for separate neural rendering. This allows controlling the eye gaze direction without affecting other facial factors. 

- Disentangle the gaze direction and other facial attributes like identity and illumination by using separate latent codes. This enables manipulating facial attributes while preserving gaze direction.

- Generate diverse gaze datasets by controlling gaze direction, head pose, identity, illumination etc. Use the synthesized data for domain generalization and adaptation of gaze estimation models.

In summary, the paper introduces NeRF-Gaze to generate high-fidelity and controllable gaze data, which helps improve gaze estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios. The core is using NeRF for accurate gaze redirection and disentangling gaze and other facial factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

- It proposes NeRF-Gaze, the first NeRF-based method for gaze data generation. NeRF-Gaze can synthesize novel views of head images and precisely control the eye gaze direction with high fidelity.

- It develops a flexible NeRF framework that can decouple the face and eyes for separate neural rendering. This allows controlling parts of the face without affecting other regions. Specifically, it enables accurate manipulation of head pose and gaze direction simultaneously.

- It disentangles gaze direction and other facial attributes like identity and illumination by using separate latent codes. This is achieved by decoding face shape/appearance codes from a 3D morphable face model.  

- Extensive experiments show NeRF-Gaze can generate high-quality gaze data by adjusting various facial factors. It facilitates gaze estimation for domain generalization and adaptation.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel gaze generation method using NeRF. It enables precise control of gaze direction and disentangled manipulation of other facial attributes. This facilitates generating diverse gaze datasets to improve generalization of gaze estimation models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel gaze data generation method called NeRF-Gaze that uses neural radiance fields to generate realistic synthetic gaze datasets with control over gaze direction, head pose, facial identity, and illumination.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in gaze estimation and neural rendering:

- This is the first work I'm aware of that applies neural radiance fields (NeRF) to gaze data generation. Most prior work on synthesizing gaze data relies on GANs or graphics-based methods. Using NeRF allows high fidelity rendering of faces with control over gaze direction.

- The key novelty is the separate modeling and rendering of the face and eyes. This allows independent control over gaze direction and other facial attributes like identity and illumination. Previous NeRF face models like HeadNeRF don't have this level of disentanglement. 

- For gaze redirection, the paper shows superior performance compared to other GAN and graphics-based approaches on metrics like gaze/pose error and image quality. This demonstrates the advantages of the NeRF modeling.

- The method is applied to domain generalization and adaptation for gaze estimation. Using the model to synthesize new training data broadens the diversity of datasets and improves cross-dataset performance. This is a practical use case that showcases the value of controllable gaze data generation.

- An interesting aspect is the use of 3D morphable face models to provide initialization for the NeRF latent codes relating to identity and illumination. This incorporation of prior knowledge may improve training stability and quality.

Overall, I think the novelty lies in the application of NeRF specifically to gaze modeling and the disentangled face/eye rendering. This unlocks new capabilities for high-fidelity, controllable gaze synthesis compared to previous work. The experiments also demonstrate practical benefits for improving gaze estimation systems.
