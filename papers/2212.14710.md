# [NeRF-Gaze: A Head-Eye Redirection Parametric Model for Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate diverse and accurate gaze data to improve gaze estimation, especially for cross-domain scenarios. 

The key points are:

- Propose a novel gaze data generation method based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that can synthesize novel views of head images and precisely control the gaze direction.

- Develop a flexible NeRF framework that can decouple the face and eyes for separate neural rendering. This allows controlling the eye gaze direction without affecting other facial factors. 

- Disentangle the gaze direction and other facial attributes like identity and illumination by using separate latent codes. This enables manipulating facial attributes while preserving gaze direction.

- Generate diverse gaze datasets by controlling gaze direction, head pose, identity, illumination etc. Use the synthesized data for domain generalization and adaptation of gaze estimation models.

In summary, the paper introduces NeRF-Gaze to generate high-fidelity and controllable gaze data, which helps improve gaze estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios. The core is using NeRF for accurate gaze redirection and disentangling gaze and other facial factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

- It proposes NeRF-Gaze, the first NeRF-based method for gaze data generation. NeRF-Gaze can synthesize novel views of head images and precisely control the eye gaze direction with high fidelity.

- It develops a flexible NeRF framework that can decouple the face and eyes for separate neural rendering. This allows controlling parts of the face without affecting other regions. Specifically, it enables accurate manipulation of head pose and gaze direction simultaneously.

- It disentangles gaze direction and other facial attributes like identity and illumination by using separate latent codes. This is achieved by decoding face shape/appearance codes from a 3D morphable face model.  

- Extensive experiments show NeRF-Gaze can generate high-quality gaze data by adjusting various facial factors. It facilitates gaze estimation for domain generalization and adaptation.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel gaze generation method using NeRF. It enables precise control of gaze direction and disentangled manipulation of other facial attributes. This facilitates generating diverse gaze datasets to improve generalization of gaze estimation models.
