# [Enhancing Quantitative Reasoning Skills of Large Language Models through   Dimension Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Quantitative reasoning involving diverse units is challenging for large language models (LLMs). Most prior work focuses solely on abstract numerical values, neglecting the critical concept of dimension tied to quantities. This leads to deficiencies in LLMs' ability to precisely comprehend quantities and perform rigorous quantitative reasoning.  

- The lack of knowledge about units and dimension poses a major obstacle. There is also a shortage of annotated datasets covering quantities to facilitate language model training. Moreover, existing math word problems feature limited unit diversity, failing to adequately evaluate quantitative reasoning.

Proposed Solution: 
- Construct a comprehensive dimensional unit knowledge base (\unitdb) with rich metadata like dimension vectors to address LLMs' knowledge gap regarding units. Develop a linking module to map text unit mentions to entries in \unitdb.

- Propose the \uniteval benchmark with 7 tasks spanning quantity extraction, dimension perception, etc. to probe and enhance LLMs' dimension skills. Semi-automated and bootstrapping methods used to build datasets. Finetune language models on these tasks to infuse dimension knowledge.  

- Formulate quantitative math word problems (Q-MWPs) by augmenting existing math word problems with diverse units. Apply dimension perception techniques like quantity-oriented data augmentation to boost performance on Q-MWPs.

Main Contributions:
- First framework improving quantitative reasoning through dimension perception. Construct extensive dimensional knowledge base unavailable in prior work.  

- Thorough benchmark covering multiple facets of quantity and dimension understanding. Semi-automated dataset creation methods to obtain quantity annotations.

- Demonstrate clear accuracy gains on quantitative reasoning tasks post dimension perception based enhancement, especially for smaller models. Establish effectiveness over tool augmented baselines.

The paper systematically probes deficient dimension skills of LLMs via new benchmarks while showing proposed techniques meaningfully improve quantitative reasoning.
