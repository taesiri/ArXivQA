# [Robust Inverse Graphics via Probabilistic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01915)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Robust Inverse Graphics via Probabilistic Inference":

Problem:
The paper aims to infer a 3D scene from a single corrupted image, where the corruptions could be due to weather effects like rain or fog, other anomalies like floaters, or even incorrect camera parameters. Current approaches rely either on randomizing the training data with different corruptions or adding specialized loss terms, but these have limitations in generalizing to new corruption types. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a Bayesian approach called Robust Inverse Graphics (RIG) that relies on a strong pre-trained scene prior and an uninformative "corruption prior". Given a single corrupted image, RIG performs joint probabilistic inference over the latent variables of the scene and corruption generative models to reconstruct the uncorrupted scene.

Specifically:
- The scene prior is a pre-trained neural radiance field (NeRF) that can render scenes from various viewpoints.
- The corruption is modeled via another NeRF with a uniform prior over its weights, allowing it to represent any 3D entity.
- Rather than finding a point estimate via MAP inference, RIG performs full variational inference over the posterior scene and corruption latents.

For the scene prior, the authors validate RIG using normalizing flow and diffusion model based NeRFs. For the latter, they propose a new diffusion conditioning method called ReGAL that enables inference in the presence of auxiliary corruption latents.

Main Contributions:
1. Proposes RIG, a general framework for robust inverse graphics using scene priors and full probabilistic inference that works for unknown corruptions.

2. Empirically demonstrates that RIG produces better depth estimates from corrupted images compared to point estimates and supervised monocular depth baselines. Also shows robustness to different scene priors.

3. Develops ReGAL, a new diffusion conditioning algorithm that enables inference over diffusion priors jointly with auxiliary latents.

The main limitation is reliance on a strong scene prior, making application to real unstructured scenes difficult currently. The inference process is also slow. Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of leveraging generative priors for robust perception tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called robust inverse graphics (RIG) for inferring an underlying 3D scene from a single corrupted image by performing probabilistic inference over scene representations and corruption parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing RIG, a general framework for robust inverse graphics via performing full probabilistic inference over scene and corruption latents.

2. Validating the RIG approach on 3D datasets with different prior and NeRF representations, across different possible corruptions. Showing theoretically and empirically that full probabilistic inference produces better results than point estimates on the monocular depth estimation task, and is competitive with direct depth-regression models. 

3. Developing reconstruction-guidance with auxiliary latents (ReGAL) and its importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo generalizations for enabling RIG on diffusion-based priors. ReGAL is a class of general-purpose diffusion conditioning methods applicable to latent variable models where a subset of the latents is modeled using a diffusion prior.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) proposing the RIG framework, (2) validating it empirically, especially against point estimates, and (3) developing the ReGAL algorithm to enable RIG with diffusion priors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Robust inverse graphics: The overall framework proposed in the paper for inferring an underlying 3D scene from a corrupted image. Relies on probabilistic inference over scene and corruption representations.

- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs): The 3D scene representation used in the paper. Both the scene and corruptions are modeled with NeRFs.

- Probabilistic inference: Instead of point estimates, the proposed approach performs full posterior inference over the latent variables to avoidissues like the "billboard effect" inherent in MAP inference. Specific techniques used include variational inference and sequential Monte Carlo.  

- Diffusion models: Powerful generative priors used to model the distribution over 3D scenes. The paper develops new diffusion conditioning techniques like ReGAL and ReGAL-SMC to enable inference with these models.

- Auxiliary latents: The corruption parameters are treated as auxiliary latents with simple/weak priors. This allows the approach to generalize to diverse corruptions without needing to model them explicitly a priori.

- Monocular depth estimation: A core task used to benchmark the robustness of the proposed approach to different image corruptions like fog, rain, etc.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the robust inverse graphics (RIG) method proposed in this paper:

1) How sensitive is the performance of RIG to the strength of the scene prior? Does a weaker scene prior lead to worse performance in reconstructing the underlying 3D scene from the corrupted image? 

2) The paper places an uninformative, uniform prior over the corruption parameters. How does changing this to a more informative prior impact the quality of the reconstructed scenes? Can we impose some reasonable assumptions to get better results?

3) RIG relies on performing full probabilistic inference over the posteriors. How much worse would the reconstructions be if we used a MAP estimate instead while keeping all other aspects fixed? What specifically would fail?

4) The paper argues theoretically and shows empirically that MAP estimates lead to "billboarding" artifacts. Can we modify or constrain the MAP optimization to avoid this problem rather than switching to full posterior inference? 

5) How does the performance of RIG degrade if we reduce the dimensionality of the scene latent space or use a less flexible neural radiance field? At what point do we start seeing substantially worse decorruptions?

6) For the diffusion model scene priors, how important is the new proposed ReGAL algorithm for conditioning compared to using existing diffusion conditioning techniques? How do the results quantitatively and qualitatively differ?

7) Can RIG be extended to perform video decorruption by incorporating temporal priors over scenes? What new technical innovations would be required to make this work?

8) The paper focuses on decorrupting a single corrupted input view. How can RIG be extended to leverage multiple input views of the same corrupted scene? Does this lead to better decorruption results?

9) Can active perception be incorporated into RIG? For example, can we train an agent to move a camera for better decorruption by optimizing the amount of information gained about the latent variables?

10) What modifications need to be made to RIG to make it work for decorrupting real-world scene images? Where would we expect the current approach to fail and why?
