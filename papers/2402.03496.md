# [Can We Remove the Square-Root in Adaptive Gradient Methods? A   Second-Order Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03496)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adaptive gradient methods like Adam are very popular for training deep learning models. However, they tend to generalize worse than SGD on convolutional neural networks while working very well on transformers. The reason for this discrepancy is not well understood. 
- The preconditioner in Adam-type methods uses the squared gradients and applies a square root, which conflates the aspects of sign descent and adaptivity. This makes it hard to isolate and study their effects.
- Removing the square root strengthens the motivation of adaptive methods as approximate second-order methods. This could help better understand them.

Proposed Solution:
- Remove the square root from adaptive methods to clearly disentangle adaptivity from sign descent. 
- Establish a rigorous second-order view of square root free adaptive methods by:
   - Interpreting the gradient outer product as a new empirical Fisher matrix 
   - Resolving the conflict with scale invariance by using this Fisher  
   - Adjusting the preconditioner initialization
- Use the second-order view to develop new adaptive methods like IF-Shampoo which works well in low precision training.

Main Contributions:
- Surprisingly find that removing the square root closes the generalization gap between adaptive methods like RMSProp and SGD on CNNs, while maintaining performance on transformers.
- This highlights the overlooked role of adaptivity in explaining the performance gap.
- The second-order perspective resolves theoretical inconsistencies and leads to new methods suitable for modern low-precision training.  
- Results raise important questions about our current understanding that attributes the success of adaptive methods mainly to sign descent.

In summary, the paper proposes to remove the square root from adaptive methods to strengthen their second-order motivation. This gives both conceptual clarity and practical benefits. The surprising empirical results demonstrate the great potential of square root free adaptive methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates removing the square root from adaptive gradient methods like Adam to strengthen their connection to second-order optimization methods, and finds this surprisingly closes the generalization gap with SGD on CNNs while maintaining performance on transformers, enables stable low-precision matrix versions, and raises questions about the role of adaptivity in their success.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper investigates removing the square root from adaptive gradient methods like Adam to strengthen their connection to second-order optimization methods. The main contributions are:

1) Empirically showing that removing the square root closes the generalization gap between adaptive methods like Adam and SGD on convolutional neural networks, while maintaining performance on transformers. This suggests adaptivity plays an important role. 

2) Establishing a rigorous second-order perspective on adaptive methods without the square root, by viewing the gradient outer product as a novel empirical Fisher matrix. This resolves issues like scale invariance.

3) Using this perspective to develop a new matrix adaptive method called IF-Shampoo that works well in low precision training. Unlike methods like Shampoo it does not require numerically unstable matrix square roots.

In summary, removing the square root provides new insights into the role of adaptivity, allows a proper second-order interpretation, and enables the development of better matrix adaptive methods suitable for modern training. The results question the necessity of the square root and highlight the overlooked importance of adaptivity in adaptive gradient methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes removing the square root from adaptive gradient methods to strengthen their connection to second-order optimization methods. However, the square root was originally introduced to improve performance and stability. What modifications were made in this work to enable stable optimization without the square root?

2. The empirical Fisher matrix proposed in this work differs from the standard empirical Fisher matrix typically used. What is the key difference in how these Fisher matrices are defined? Why does this new definition better match the outer product matrix used in adaptive methods?

3. This work demonstrates improved generalization performance of square-root-free adaptive methods on CNNs. However, the reasons behind the generalization gap between adaptive methods and SGD on CNNs are not fully understood. Does removing the square root provide any new insights into this gap? 

4. The paper demonstrates that removing the square root maintains performance on transformers while improving CNN performance. Is there an intuition why the square root is less important for transformers but detrimental for CNNs?

5. The Bayesian learning rule is utilized to provide a second-order interpretation of adaptive methods. How does this Bayesian perspective allow the preconditioner matrix and curvature approximation to have different structures?

6. Inverse-free Shampoo is introduced as a low-precision alternative to Shampoo. Why do matrix decomposition methods like Shampoo require high precision while inverse-free methods do not? What are the practical benefits of inverse-free Shampoo?

7. The paper refers to sign descent and adaptivity as key factors behind adaptive methods' performance. With the square root removed, only adaptivity remains. What does this suggest about the relative importance of adaptivity versus sign descent?  

8. Could the improved CNN performance after removing the square root be related to differences in loss landscape curvature between CNNs and transformers? Why might the square root interact differently with curvature?

9. The initial motivation for introducing the square root was improved optimization stability near the solution. Are there other ways to achieve this stability that preserve the second-order interpretation?

10. The new empirical Fisher matrix relies on the joint distribution over labels. What are the advantages of a joint versus per-example distribution? Does it relate to why the outer product differs from the standard empirical Fisher?
