# [Synergistic Signals: Exploiting Co-Engagement and Semantic Links via   Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04071)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes SemanticGNN, a novel graph neural network approach for learning entity embeddings that accurately reflect semantic and co-engagement similarities from a large-scale knowledge graph. The key innovation is the combined usage of sparse co-engagement signals and abundant semantic metadata to address cold-start and popularity bias issues in entity recommendation. The method has three main components: (1) knowledge graph pretraining to obtain informative concept node features, (2) a relation-aware graph neural network architecture that handles imbalanced edge distributions via distinguishing neighbor influence based on relation types, and (3) a heterogeneity-aware, semantic-preserving subgraph generation scheme for efficient distributed training on multiple GPUs. Experiments conducted on the Netflix catalog graph demonstrate significant performance gains over baselines, especially for new/unpopular entities. Additional analyses also showcase SemanticGNN's superior inductive performance and its ability to augment the graph with high-quality new edges. The model has been successfully deployed at Netflix, enabling more accurate entity recommendations. Key strengths lie in its interpretability, generalizability, and practical large-scale distributed training.
