## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel zero-shot wireless sensing solution to address the challenges of data heterogeneity and lack of labeled data in wireless sensing systems. The key idea is to develop a physical-layer semantic-aware network (pSAN) framework that captures the correlations between semantic features (related to physical layouts and human gestures) and wireless signal distributions across different receivers. Based on pSAN, a zero-shot learning algorithm is proposed where models trained on receivers with labeled data are transferred to receivers without any labels, using the semantic similarities between locations. Specifically, each receiver aggregates existing models from other receivers using coefficients derived from semantic correlations. Theoretically, it is proven that the aggregated models can approach optimal localized models. Experiments on a real-world gesture dataset verify that the transferred models achieve significantly higher accuracy than conventional localized or globalized training, with over 60\% improvement. By exploiting semantic knowledge and correlations, the pSAN framework enables effective model transfer and avoids costly labeled data collection across diverse wireless sensing environments.
