# [Molecular Graph Generation via Geometric Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06241v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate novel molecular graphs with desirable physicochemical properties in a direct and efficient way using graph neural networks? The key hypotheses are:1) The geometric scattering transform can be used to obtain useful global representations of molecular graphs that capture structural properties.2) Training an autoencoder on scattering moments with regression penalties will yield a latent space that reflects molecular structure and properties. 3) A generative model can be trained adversarially to produce valid molecular graphs directly from points in this latent space.4) This overall framework (termed GRASSY) will allow efficient generation of molecular graphs with tunable physicochemical properties.The paper aims to demonstrate that the proposed GRASSY architecture can learn meaningful representations of molecules, provide a smooth latent space for interpolation, and generate valid molecular graphs more effectively compared to prior graph generation methods. The experiments on ZINC and BindingDB datasets are designed to test these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces GRASSY, a novel method for molecular graph generation. The key ideas and contributions are:- It uses a geometric scattering transform to obtain a high-dimensional embedding of molecular graphs that captures multiscale structural information. - The scattering features are fed into a regularized autoencoder that learns a latent representation organized by molecular properties. This allows generating molecules with desired properties.- A GAN framework is used to generate valid molecular graphs directly from the latent space, without needing sequential generation steps. - Experiments on ZINC and BindingDB datasets show GRASSY can generate a higher proportion of chemically valid and realistic molecules compared to previous methods like MolGAN and GraphAF.- The physicochemical properties vary smoothly in the learned latent space, allowing property prediction.In summary, the main contribution is a representation learning approach to molecular graph generation, where a structured latent space capturing properties is learned, then leveraged via a GAN to generate molecules with desired characteristics in a direct one-step process. The use of a geometric scattering transform provides a powerful graph embedding method.
