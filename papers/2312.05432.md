# [Fusing Multiple Algorithms for Heterogeneous Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05432)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of online learning in contexts where agents accumulate disparate data, face resource constraints, and use different local algorithms. Specifically, it considers a multi-agent optimization problem where agents gather data asynchronously, have limitations in computation/communication, and need to make timely decisions by fusing updates from different local algorithms.  

Proposed Solution - Switched Online Learning Algorithm (SOLA):
The paper introduces SOLA to solve the heterogeneous online learning problem by amalgamating updates from diverse agents through a dynamic switching mechanism based on their performance. At any time, SOLA selects one agent using a switching signal and fuses its update into the parameter estimate using a fusing variable that depends on the relative performance of the old and new estimates. 

Theoretical Contributions:
- Provides sufficient conditions on the switching signal (number of switches needs to be upper bounded) to ensure SOLA has bounded regret. This is based on modeling SOLA as a switched dynamical system and leveraging contraction theory.
- Derives how characteristics of the cost function, data, and algorithms affect the bound on the number of switches.
- Establishes connection between stability of online learning algorithms and bounded regret using contraction theory.

Numerical Experiments:
- Online linear regression: Compares performance of SOLA versus decentralized SGD and shows combining updates from GD and decentralized SGD gives better performance.
- Online classification on MNIST: Achieves 82% accuracy by alternating between centralized GD and decentralized SGD despite agents only getting access to limited noisy data.

Overall, the paper provides a way to systematically fuse updates from heterogeneous learning algorithms used by agents with disparate data and capabilities to effectively solve online optimization problems. The regret analysis and experiments demonstrate the utility of the proposed SOLA algorithm.
