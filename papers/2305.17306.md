# Chain-of-Thought Hub: A Continuous Effort to Measure Large Language   Models' Reasoning Performance

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is:How to develop an open-source evaluation suite to systematically measure and track the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models?The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:- Multi-step reasoning capability is a key differentiator between weaker and stronger large language models. Evaluating this capability can provide insights into how to improve LLMs.- Large language models need strong reasoning skills to become useful as general purpose computational platforms and support downstream applications. Thus it is important to measure their reasoning skills.- Curating a high quality suite of reasoning benchmarks and using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting is an effective way to evaluate LLMs' reasoning skills.In summary, the paper proposes the Chain-of-Thought Hub, an open benchmark suite, to track LLMs' reasoning performance over time. This is motivated by the hypotheses that reasoning capability is a key metric and that few-shot prompting is an effective evaluation method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing the Chain-of-Thought Hub, an open-source evaluation suite for measuring large language models' reasoning capabilities. The hub focuses on multi-step reasoning benchmarks that require composing multiple operations.- Compiling a collection of challenging reasoning datasets and using them to evaluate major LLMs including GPT, Claude, PaLM and LLaMA models. The benchmark suite includes math, science, coding, and commonsense reasoning datasets.- Providing an analysis of the results, showing the correlation between model scale and reasoning performance. The results indicate gaps between open source and proprietary models, and suggest focusing on better base model pretraining and reinforcement learning from human feedback could help close these gaps.- Highlighting the potential of the open source LLaMA 65B model. The results show it performs closely to Code-davinci-002, suggesting with further work like RLHF it could reach performance comparable to GPT-3.5.- Proposing the Chain-of-Thought Hub as an ongoing benchmark to track progress in LLMs' reasoning capabilities. The goal is to guide community efforts towards developing stronger reasoning abilities in open source language models.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing this open benchmark suite to measure and track progress in large language models' complex reasoning skills, providing an analysis of current models, and suggesting directions to improve reasoning abilities in open source LLMs.
