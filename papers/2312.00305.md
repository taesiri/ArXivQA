# [Multiple Testing of Linear Forms for Noisy Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00305)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a general methodology for multiple testing of linear forms in the context of noisy matrix completion, motivated by applications like making recommendations in large-scale collaborative filtering systems. The authors introduce new test statistics for individual hypotheses that enjoy sharper asymptotic normality compared to existing methods. To aggregate these statistics for multiple testing while accounting for dependencies, they utilize a data splitting and symmetric aggregation scheme along with an explicit characterization of the correlations. Under weak correlation assumptions, this approach provably controls false discovery rate (FDR) with optimal power guarantees. For situations with stronger correlations, the authors propose additional whitening and screening steps to reduce dependencies. Extensive simulation studies and real data experiments on movie ratings and store sales datasets demonstrate the practical utility of the developed techniques for controlling FDR with good power in testing problems arising from matrix completion. Key innovations include sharper test statistics for individual hypotheses, a symmetric data aggregation scheme tailored to matrix completion, and a framework to analyze dependencies and power that also suggests effective screening methods.
