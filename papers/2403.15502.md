# [Sequential Decision-Making for Inline Text Autocomplete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of improving inline autocomplete suggestions in text entry systems, which provide the user with up to one suggestion at a time displayed inline with the text they are typing. Existing autocomplete systems use a fixed threshold on the confidence of suggestions from a language model, but do not directly account for the cognitive load imposed on users by interrupting them with suggestions. The goal is to generate better inline suggestions while minimizing this cognitive load.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors formulate inline autocomplete as a sequential decision making problem using a Markov decision process (MDP) framework, where the autocomplete model is trained via reinforcement learning. This allows defining a reward function based on text entry speed that captures the cognitive load of surfacing suggestions. The state represents the text entered so far plus candidate completions from a language model, and the actions are to display one of the candidates or wait. 

Main Contributions:
1) Theoretical analysis showing when sequential reasoning could improve over myopic reasoning in a simple setup.
2) Simulated experiments comparing RL agents to baselines on an idealized user. The RL agents did not significantly improve over a threshold-based approach.
3) A user study estimating parameters of the reward function. It found cognitive load is independent of suggestion length but depends on correctness. Also found no evidence for accumulated user fatigue.  
4) Key recommendation that improving text entry speed may not be the right objective. Instead should aim for metrics like user satisfaction by considering more realistic user behavior.

The main findings are that while theoretical evidence exists for when sequential reasoning helps, the goal of solely maximizing text entry speed does not benefit from the RL approach for an idealized user. Future work should consider objectives better aligned with real user preferences.
