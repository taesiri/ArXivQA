# [Black-Box Approximation and Optimization with Hierarchical Tucker   Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many real-world problems involve optimizing or approximating complex high-dimensional black-box functions where the internal structure is unknown. This includes problems in physics, engineering, machine learning etc.
- Existing methods like gradient-based optimization fail for such black-box functions. Standard gradient-free methods like evolutionary algorithms also struggle in high dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called HTBB that uses low-rank hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decompositions to simultaneously address the black-box approximation and optimization problems.

- Key ideas:
   (1) Adaptively query the black-box function to construct a low rank HT tensor decomposition that serves as a surrogate model
   (2) Use the MaxVol algorithm to efficiently find the required indices when constructing the HT decomposition
   (3) Traverse the HT tree structure sequentially to find indices that need updating

- Based on the HT surrogate, the function can be approximated or optimized using gradient-free methods.

Contributions:
- A new approximation method called HT-cross that uses HT decomposition and MaxVol index selection
- A new optimization method called HTOpt using similar ideas
- Unified implementation of the methods as a HTBB package for black-box approximation and optimization
- Evaluation on 14 benchmark problems up to 1000 dimensions showing accuracy and robustness improvements over tensor train (TT) methods

The key advantage is that HT decompositions are more expressive and robust compared to simpler tensor networks like TT, especially for very high dimensional problems. By leveraging HT structure and MaxVol indexing, the proposed HTBB method outperforms state-of-the-art TT methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new method called HTBB for black-box approximation and optimization of high-dimensional functions, which uses hierarchical Tucker decomposition with MaxVol index selection to build a low-rank surrogate model and find the extremum.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The development of a new black-box approximation method HT-cross based on the hierarchical Tucker (HT) decomposition and the rectangular MaxVol index selection procedure.

2) The development of a new gradient-free optimization method HTOpt also based on the HT decomposition and rectangular MaxVol.

3) The implementation of the proposed HT-cross and HTOpt algorithms as a unified method called HTBB for surrogate modeling and optimization of multidimensional black-box functions.

4) The application of HTBB to 14 complex model problems with dimensions up to 1000, demonstrating its significantly higher accuracy and robustness compared to methods based on the tensor train (TT) decomposition and classical gradient-free optimization algorithms.

In summary, the key contribution is a new tensor network-based method for black-box approximation and optimization that leverages the more expressive hierarchical Tucker format to achieve better performance than approaches relying on the simpler TT decomposition.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Black-box optimization - The paper focuses on optimization of functions given as black boxes, where the internal structure is unknown.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with using hierarchical Tucker decomposition along with MaxVol for black-box approximation and optimization in a gradient-free setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the MaxVol algorithm for efficiently finding the required indices in the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Can you explain in more detail how the MaxVol algorithm works and why it is well-suited for this application? 

2. The hierarchical Tucker format is more expressive and robust than simpler tensor networks like the TT format. Can you elaborate on the specific advantages of using the hierarchical Tucker format here compared to simpler formats?

3. The paper mentions that the hierarchical Tucker format allows for parallelization during the calculation of tensor values. Can you explain how the parallelization works and why the hierarchical format enables this?  

4. The paper proposes a sequential traversal method for updating index values in the tree structure. Can you explain this traversal process in more detail and why a sequential approach was chosen?

5. How exactly are the upper and down indices defined in the hierarchical Tucker tree? Can you walk through an example showing how these indices are initialized and then get updated during the algorithm?

6. The transformation function T(x) uses an adaptive approach based on the sample mean and variance. Can you explain why adaptivity is important here and how the choice of T(x) impacts performance?

7. For building the cores, a QR decomposition approach is used. What is the motivation for using QR here and how does it relate to achieving a maximum volume submatrix?  

8. The paper demonstrates a significant accuracy advantage over TT methods. Can you analyze the reasons why HT format provides better accuracy and expressiveness for these complex high dimensional functions?

9. The optimization results show HTBB consistently outperforming alternatives like TTOpt and PSO. What aspects of the HTBB method contribute to superior optimization performance? 

10. The paper focuses on a budget limited setting. How would you extend the approach to support unlimited budgets or provide error/confidence bounds during approximation?
