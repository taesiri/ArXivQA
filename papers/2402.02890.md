# [Black-Box Approximation and Optimization with Hierarchical Tucker   Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many real-world problems involve optimizing or approximating complex high-dimensional black-box functions where the internal structure is unknown. This includes problems in physics, engineering, machine learning etc.
- Existing methods like gradient-based optimization fail for such black-box functions. Standard gradient-free methods like evolutionary algorithms also struggle in high dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called HTBB that uses low-rank hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decompositions to simultaneously address the black-box approximation and optimization problems.

- Key ideas:
   (1) Adaptively query the black-box function to construct a low rank HT tensor decomposition that serves as a surrogate model
   (2) Use the MaxVol algorithm to efficiently find the required indices when constructing the HT decomposition
   (3) Traverse the HT tree structure sequentially to find indices that need updating

- Based on the HT surrogate, the function can be approximated or optimized using gradient-free methods.

Contributions:
- A new approximation method called HT-cross that uses HT decomposition and MaxVol index selection
- A new optimization method called HTOpt using similar ideas
- Unified implementation of the methods as a HTBB package for black-box approximation and optimization
- Evaluation on 14 benchmark problems up to 1000 dimensions showing accuracy and robustness improvements over tensor train (TT) methods

The key advantage is that HT decompositions are more expressive and robust compared to simpler tensor networks like TT, especially for very high dimensional problems. By leveraging HT structure and MaxVol indexing, the proposed HTBB method outperforms state-of-the-art TT methods.
