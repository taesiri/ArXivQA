# [Bit Rate Matching Algorithm Optimization in JPEG-AI Verification Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17487)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural network (NN) based image compression models can achieve better compression performance than traditional codecs, but most models can only provide fixed compression rates. 
- The JPEG-AI verification model (VM) 4.1 uses a "gain unit" method to achieve continuous variable rate coding, but this requires iterative bit rate matching (BRM) which has high complexity.

Proposed Solution:
- Optimize the 3 main steps of BRM in VM 4.1: model selection, β_test searching, and β_test validation.

Model Selection:
- Select model with default bpp closest to target bpp based on relative bit distance instead of loss. Saves computation time.

β_test Searching: 
- Discovered approximately linear logarithmic relationship between β_test and bpp. Can directly calculate β_test instead of binary search.

β_test Validation:
- Store latent tensor from first iteration instead of recomputing. Skip loss calculation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed BRM optimizations provide 4x speedup for base operation point and 6.3x for high operation point over prior BRM in VM 4.1.
- Achieve 1.1% better BD-rate for base operation point without loss in quality.
- Significant complexity reduction allows practical application of continuous rate coding in VM 4.1.

In summary, the paper proposes optimizations to the computationally complex BRM process in the JPEG-AI VM to achieve faster continuous rate coding while improving rate-distortion performance. The solutions exploit properties of the β_test-bpp relationship and avoid unnecessary computations.
