# [Fast View Synthesis of Casual Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02135)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an efficient novel view synthesis method for casual videos that achieves quality comparable to state-of-the-art neural rendering techniques while being over 100 times faster. The key idea is to use a hybrid explicit scene representation that handles static and dynamic content differently. Static areas are modeled globally with an extended soup of oriented planes augmented with spherical harmonics and displacement maps to enable view-dependent effects and represent complex geometries. Dynamic regions use per-frame point clouds for efficiency, with some temporal blending for consistency. A loss function and optimization strategy is developed to estimate this representation from a monocular input video in just 15 minutes. Experiments on the NVIDIA and DAVIS datasets demonstrate that this approach produces high-quality temporally coherent novel views in real time, unlike prior work based on implicit neural radiance fields that require lengthy per-scene training and optimization. The efficiency comes from revisiting explicit video representations, differentiating static and dynamic content, and carefully designing the representation and training procedure.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an efficient novel view synthesis method for casual videos that uses a hybrid explicit representation with separate global static and per-frame dynamic models to achieve comparable quality to neural rendering approaches but with over 100x faster training and real-time rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. A hybrid explicit non-neural representation that can model both static and dynamic video content, support view-dependent effects and complex surface geometries, and enable real-time rendering.

2. A per-video optimization algorithm together with a set of carefully designed loss functions to estimate the above hybrid video representation from a monocular video.

3. Extensive evaluations showing that their method can generate novel views with comparable quality to state-of-the-art neural radiance field (NeRF) based view synthesis methods while being 100x faster for both training and rendering.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient hybrid video representation and optimization method that achieves comparable quality to NeRF-based approaches for novel view synthesis from monocular videos, while being significantly faster for both training and rendering. The key ideas are to decomposed the video into static and dynamic content, use extended soup of planes to represent the static background, per-frame point clouds for the dynamic content, and develop an optimization strategy with losses to estimate this representation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Novel view synthesis - The paper focuses on synthesizing novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. This is the main problem being addressed.

- Hybrid representation - The method uses a hybrid representation to model both static and dynamic video content. This includes a global plane-based model for static content and per-frame point clouds for dynamic content.

- Soup of planes - The static scene representation is based on a "soup of oriented planes" which is augmented to capture view-dependent effects and complex geometries. This builds on prior piecewise planar stereo work.

- Explicit representation - Instead of using an implicit neural representation like NeRF, this method uses an explicit hybrid representation to achieve faster training and real-time rendering speeds.

- Per-video optimization - Like other recent methods, this approach uses a per-video optimization strategy to achieve high quality novel view synthesis from a monocular video.

- Temporal consistency - A key goal is generating temporally coherent novel views, especially for the static content.

- Efficiency - The method prioritizes efficiency in training and rendering, with a goal of real-time performance. This is enabled by the explicit hybrid representation.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a hybrid explicit representation for efficient novel view synthesis instead of an implicit neural representation like NeRF. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using an explicit vs implicit representation for this task?

2. The static and dynamic scene contents are handled separately in the proposed approach. What are the benefits of this decomposition and how does it enable more efficient novel view synthesis?

4. The paper augments the plane-based representation with spherical harmonics and displacement maps to enable view-dependent effects and better approximate non-planar geometry. Explain the motivation behind this and how it allows planar representations to better model complex static scene content.

5. Per-frame point clouds are used to represent dynamic content. What is the rationale behind using a per-frame vs global representation for dynamics? What are some limitations of this approach?

6. Neighboring frame blending is utilized for the dynamic content. Explain the purpose of this and why it can help improve temporal consistency despite using a per-frame representation.  

7. The paper discusses the common use of scene flow as a regularization in other methods. Explain what scene flow regularization is, what problem it aims to address, and why the authors chose not to use it.

8. Loss functions play an important role in optimizing the proposed hybrid representation. Discuss 2-3 key losses that enable effective optimization of the static and dynamic representations.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Novel view synthesis from an in-the-wild video is challenging due to scene dynamics and lack of parallax. While neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown promising results, they are slow to train and render. This paper aims to develop a method that can generate high-quality novel views from a monocular video both efficiently and effectively.

Method:
The key idea is to use a hybrid explicit scene representation that treats static and dynamic content differently, and enables real-time rendering while achieving comparable quality to NeRFs. 

Specifically, static content is represented globally using an extended soup of oriented planes augmented with spherical harmonics and displacement maps to capture view-dependent effects and complex geometries. Dynamic content uses per-frame point clouds for efficiency. While this can introduce inconsistencies, they are perceptually masked by motion. Neighboring frames are blended using optical flow for temporal consistency.

The hybrid representation is optimized from an input video using photometric losses, smoothness regularizations, etc. The real-time renderability allows training to finish in 15 minutes.

Main Contributions:
- A hybrid explicit scene representation that can model both static and dynamic content in videos, support view-dependent effects, complex geometries and enable real-time rendering.

- An optimization method with carefully designed losses to estimate the hybrid representation from a monocular video.

- Extensive experiments showing the method achieves comparable quality to state-of-the-art NeRF methods on two datasets, while being 100x faster in training and rendering.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient high-quality monocular video view synthesis method by using a hybrid scene representation and optimization strategy tailored for videos. The much improved efficiency while maintaining quality could enable more practical dynamic view synthesis.
