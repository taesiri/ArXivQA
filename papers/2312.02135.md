# [Fast View Synthesis of Casual Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02135)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an efficient novel view synthesis method for casual videos that achieves quality comparable to state-of-the-art neural rendering techniques while being over 100 times faster. The key idea is to use a hybrid explicit scene representation that handles static and dynamic content differently. Static areas are modeled globally with an extended soup of oriented planes augmented with spherical harmonics and displacement maps to enable view-dependent effects and represent complex geometries. Dynamic regions use per-frame point clouds for efficiency, with some temporal blending for consistency. A loss function and optimization strategy is developed to estimate this representation from a monocular input video in just 15 minutes. Experiments on the NVIDIA and DAVIS datasets demonstrate that this approach produces high-quality temporally coherent novel views in real time, unlike prior work based on implicit neural radiance fields that require lengthy per-scene training and optimization. The efficiency comes from revisiting explicit video representations, differentiating static and dynamic content, and carefully designing the representation and training procedure.
