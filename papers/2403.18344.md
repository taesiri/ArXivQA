# [LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions   with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurately predicting surrounding vehicles' lane change intentions and future trajectories is critical for autonomous vehicles to ensure safe driving. However, existing approaches have limitations in long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. Specifically, they exhibit weak capability in modeling complex interactions between vehicles, resulting in inferior long-term prediction performance. Additionally, they offer little explanation behind their prediction results.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs). They reconceptualize lane change prediction as a language modeling task. Heterogeneous driving scenario information is structured as natural language prompts and input into the LLM. Through supervised fine-tuning, the LLM is tailored for accurate lane change intention and trajectory prediction. Moreover, explanatory requirements are incorporated into prompts during inference, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to provide explanations alongside its predictions.  

Main Contributions:
1) This is the first attempt to leverage LLMs for lane change prediction by reformulating it as a language modeling problem.

2) The proposed LC-LLM achieves superior performance in long-term prediction compared to baselines, with 3.1% higher intention prediction accuracy, 19.4% lower lateral trajectory error, and 38.1% lower longitudinal trajectory error.

3) LC-LLM enhances interpretability by generating natural language explanations for its lane change intention and trajectory predictions. Visualizations demonstrate its ability to provide reasonable explanations based on interactive driving scenario information.

In summary, this paper pioneers the application of LLMs for lane change prediction and showcases their potential in understanding complex interactions for improved prediction accuracy and interpretability. The LC-LLM model and the language-based problem reformulationopen promising research directions.
