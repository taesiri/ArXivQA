# [Teaching Machines to Code: Smart Contract Translation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Translating smart contracts from one language (e.g. Solidity) to another (e.g. Move) is challenging, especially when the target language has limited code resources/documentation.
- Existing LLMs struggle to learn coding concepts from descriptions and apply that knowledge to translate code to unfamiliar languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce SolMover framework with two LLMs - one focused on concept mining and sub-task creation, another specialized for code generation.
- Concept mining LLM is fine-tuned on Move textbooks/specs to understand concepts. It generates sub-tasks using retrieval augmented search. 
- Code generation LLM (Sol-Mover) is fine-tuned on instruction dataset and tasked with producing Move code from the sub-tasks.

- Bug mitigation via compiler error feedback loop and Move prover verification.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of using LLM for code translation to low-resource languages through fine-tuning and integration of two specialized LLMs.
- Concept mining via retrieval augmented search to distill concepts from textbooks into sub-tasks.
- Iterative compiler error feedback loop enhances code quality and lowers bugs.
- Comparative assessment shows SolMover framework outperforms baseline gpt-3.5-turbo across metrics like successful compilations, bug reductions, code correctness.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative framework to translate smart contracts utilizing synergistic LLMs. The concept distillation and compiler error mitigation strategies contribute significantly towards making code translation achievable even for unfamiliar target languages with scarce code data.
