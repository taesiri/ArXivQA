# [Energy-Efficient Power Control for Multiple-Task Split Inference in   UAVs: A Tiny Learning-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying AI models on drones/UAVs is challenging due to their limited computing capabilities and battery life. Using split inference (dividing model between device and server) can help mitigate this, but optimally utilizing split inference across multiple sequential tasks under dynamic conditions is complex.

Solution:
- Propose a two-timescale approach to minimize energy consumption in split inference for multiple sequential tasks. Segregates optimization variables into two timescales:
     - Discrete decisions (which mode to use for each task) handled in longer timescale using Tiny Reinforcement Learning (TRL).
     - Continuous optimizations (transmission power levels) handled in shorter timescale using Optimization Programming (OP).
- TRL selects mode per task based on state (queue levels, time left, battery). OP optimizes power levels between TRL's outputs.
- Reveal energy consumption reduces monotonically with transmission time. Hence optimize transmission time instead of power to simplify OP. Enables fast closed-form solution.

Contributions:
- Novel TRL+OP two-timescale framework to simplify optimization with reduced action space.
- Optimal algorithm to minimize transmit power by optimizing transmission time per task instead.
- Results show higher success rate in meeting deadlines and lower energy consumption compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient two-timescale approach using TRL and OP to optimize split inference deployment on drones across multiple tasks. By segregating discrete and continuous decisions, simplifying the OP, and optimizing transmission time, energy consumption is minimized.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an optimal two-timescale framework to minimize energy consumption for multiple-task split inference in UAVs, which learns discrete transmission mode selections with tiny reinforcement learning and embeds optimization programming to optimize the continuous transmit power allocation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an optimization programming (OP)-embedded tiny reinforcement learning (TRL) framework for energy-efficient power control in multi-task split inference for UAVs. This segregates the discrete (transmission mode selection) and continuous (power allocation) variables into two timescales, allowing TRL to handle the former and OP for the latter. This reduces the action space size and training complexity compared to conventional deep reinforcement learning.

2. It develops an optimal algorithm to solve the OP for transmit power optimization. This involves reformulating the chance constraints using sample average approximation, then transforming the problem into parallel subproblems using ADMM to reduce complexity. It then shows that optimizing transmission time monotonically reduces energy, allowing a fast closed-form solution for optimal power. 

3. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OPETRL algorithm achieves higher probability of successful task completion with lower energy consumption compared to baseline policies. It can effectively handle the coupling between sequential tasks under random wireless channels.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel TRL+OP framework for multi-task split inference in resource-constrained UAVs, along with the optimal power control algorithm developed. The results showcase improved performance over alternatives.
