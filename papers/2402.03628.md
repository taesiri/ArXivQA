# [Professional Agents -- Evolving Large Language Models into Autonomous   Experts with Human-Level Competencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03628)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT demonstrate impressive language fluency and reasoning abilities, but have not yet been applied to real-world professional services and domains. 
- There is a need to harness LLM capabilities to create autonomous agents that can replicate human-level expertise and provide professional-grade services.

Proposed Solution - Professional Agents (PAgents):
- PAgents are AI systems designed to acquire specialized skills and demonstrate professional competencies like human experts. 
- They have a sophisticated 3-layer architecture: base tool layer, agent layer, synergy layer.
- Individual PAgents have 4 key modules - Role, Perception, Brain, Action. These provide professional identity, multimodal perception, conversation/memory/planning/reasoning abilities, and tools to take actions.
- PAgents "gene" defines core functionality and knowledge to operate effectively.
- They can self-evolve through experience, coevolve through collaboration, integrate human feedback, undergo gene refinement, and learn from senior PAgents. 
- Groups of PAgents form Multi-PAgent systems that pool expertise, allocate tasks dynamically, and optimize problem solving.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces concept of Professional Agents (PAgents) as a way to achieve artificial general intelligence using LLMs specialized for professional services.
- Proposes a modular architecture and tri-layer framework for constructing capable, interactive, and evolving PAgents. 
- Discusses mechanisms like memory, planning, conversation that can equip PAgents with sophisticated cognitive skills.
- Highlights five patterns for continuous development of PAgents - self-evolution, coevolution, human guidance, gene refinement, guidance from senior PAgents.
- Explains how groups of PAgents can collaborate by communication approaches, network organization, and message exchange.
- Overall, provides a pipeline for creating PAgents that can match or exceed human-level competencies.
