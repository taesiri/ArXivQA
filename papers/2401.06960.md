# [Transformer for Object Re-Identification: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Object re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match the same object across different cameras and retrieve specific objects from large-scale databases. It has been dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for a long time. However, CNNs have limitations in modeling long-range dependencies, unsupervised learning, multimodal data fusion, etc. Recently, Transformers have achieved great success in computer vision, showing potential for advancing Re-ID, especially in challenging scenarios. But existing Re-ID surveys focus on CNN methods and there lacks a comprehensive analysis of Transformers in this field. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides an in-depth review and analysis of Transformer-based Re-ID research. It categorizes Re-ID tasks into four scenarios: (1) regular image/video Re-ID; (2) Re-ID with limited data/annotations; (3) cross-modal Re-ID; (4) special Re-ID scenarios. The advantages of Transformers are analyzed from the perspectives of architecture, modeling capability, scalability, flexibility and special properties. The paper also summarizes Transformer's applications and adaptations in different Re-ID tasks. In addition, the paper explores animal Re-ID which poses unique challenges and lacks standardized benchmarks. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate different backbones and analyze Transformer's suitability.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive survey and in-depth analysis of Transformer advances in Re-ID across different scenarios
- Proposal of a strong Transformer baseline for unsupervised single/cross-modal Re-ID
- Introduction and analysis of animal Re-ID, along with unified experimental standards and backbone evaluations
- Identification of under-investigated open issues in Re-ID for future work, including unified large foundation models and efficient Transformer deployment

The paper provides valuable insights into Transformer's capabilities in advancing Re-ID research, especially for complex scenarios. It also expands the scope to less studied areas like animal Re-ID and points out promising future directions. The analysis and experiments greatly benefit the community.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the application of Transformer models in object re-identification across various scenarios, proposing a new strong baseline, and highlighting progress and challenges in the less explored area of animal re-identification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of transformer-based methods for object re-identification (Re-ID). The main contributions are:

1) It conducts an in-depth analysis of the strengths of transformers and reviews their application across four key research directions in Re-ID: image/video-based Re-ID, Re-ID with limited data/annotations, cross-modal Re-ID, and special Re-ID scenarios. 

2) It proposes a new transformer-based unsupervised baseline for single-modal and cross-modal Re-ID, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

3) It explores the relatively less studied area of animal Re-ID, summarizes datasets and methods, develops unified benchmarks, and evaluates the feasibility of using transformers for this task.

4) It discusses important yet under-investigated issues regarding large-scale foundation models and efficient deployment of transformers for Re-ID, providing directions for future work.

In summary, this is a very comprehensive survey that thoroughly reviews the progress, advantages, and promise of transformers for advancing Re-ID research across diverse scenarios and objects. The analysis, new baseline, and benchmarks are valuable contributions to the field.

3. What motivated the authors to explore the application of Transformers for animal re-identification? What are some key challenges and differences compared to conventional person/vehicle re-id?

4. The paper evaluates several backbone architectures on multiple animal re-id datasets. Analyze and compare the results - which architecture demonstrates the most consistent performance and why?

5. The paper argues Transformers are well-suited for re-id tasks requiring modeling of global, local and spatio-temporal relationships. Elaborate on this in the context of image-based, video-based and cross-modal re-id.  

6. Explain how the tokenization capability, flexible attention mechanisms, and inherent sequence modeling capacity of Transformers can benefit video re-identification.

7. How can the masked image modeling and self-supervised pre-training capabilities of Transformers help advance unsupervised re-id with limited annotations?
