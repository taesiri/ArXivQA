# [ChEDDAR: Student-ChatGPT Dialogue in EFL Writing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13243)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI (GAI) like ChatGPT is increasingly used by students, but there is limited understanding of real-world longitudinal interactions between students and AI systems. 
- Prior GAI research lacks analysis of usage patterns and focuses on short-term effects rather than long-term trends.
- There is also limited research on GAI in the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education specifically.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces ChEDDAR, a dataset collected from a semester-long experiment with 212 college students using ChatGPT to revise essays in EFL writing courses. 
- ChEDDAR captures dialogue logs, essay edit history, student satisfaction ratings, intent annotations, and surveys on student objectives and experiences.

Main Contributions:
1) Release an extensive dataset capturing real-world, longitudinal human-AI interactions in EFL education.
2) Analyze students' usage patterns and perceptions of ChatGPT over time.
3) Identify two key tasks for advancing GAI-integrated education: intent detection and satisfaction estimation.
4) Establish baseline experimental results on ChEDDAR for these tasks.
5) Outline future scenarios to further integrate GAI in education leveraging this data.

In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution by releasing ChEDDAR, the first dataset that captures semester-long, real-world interactions between EFL students and ChatGPT. Both the data and analyses provide valuable insights into human-AI collaboration within educational contexts over time.
