# [VEXIR2Vec: An Architecture-Neutral Embedding Framework for Binary   Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of binary code similarity - determining similar functions between two binary executables. This is an important problem with applications in areas like security, plagiarism detection, etc. However, solving this at the binary level is challenging due to differences introduced by compilers, optimizations, architectures, and obfuscations. Existing solutions have limitations in terms of scope, scalability, availability of software, and handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes VexIR2Vec, a novel framework to learn function embeddings from Valgrind's VEX IR in an architecture-neutral way. The key ideas are:

1) Extract VEX IR from binaries and break functions into smaller peepholes. Apply custom optimizations via Peephole Optimization Engine to simplify and normalize the IR.

2) Learn distributed vector representations of VEX IR entities like opcodes, operands, etc. using knowledge graph embeddings. Build function embeddings bottom-up using these entities to avoid OOV.

3) Train a Siamese network with triplet loss to map functions to vector space where similar functions are closer.

Main Contributions:

1) VexIR2Vec - An architecture and application-independent embedding framework for binary similarity

2) Peephole Optimization Engine with custom optimizations to de-clutter and simplify VEX IR

3) Technique to build function embeddings from VEX IR entities to avoid OOV

4) Extensive evaluation showing superior performance over state-of-the-art on diffing and searching tasks

5) Highly scalable parallel implementation using only open source tools, 3.2x faster than closest competitor

The solution is robust to obfuscations, cross-compiler, cross-architecture, and cross-optimization scenarios. Evaluated on real-world binaries and vulnerabilities to demonstrate practical applicability.
