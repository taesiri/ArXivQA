# [VEXIR2Vec: An Architecture-Neutral Embedding Framework for Binary   Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00507)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes VexIR2Vec, a novel framework for representing binaries as vectors to solve the binary similarity problem. The key ideas are: 1) Use VEX IR, an intermediate representation from binary analysis tools like Angr, as it is architecture-neutral. 2) Decompose functions into "peepholes" across basic blocks and optimize them with a custom peephole optimization engine to simplify and normalize the IR. 3) Learn distributed representations of VEX IR entities like opcodes using knowledge graph embeddings. 4) Construct function embeddings in a bottom-up manner from these entities to avoid OOV issues. 5) Train a Siamese network with triplet loss to translate embeddings to a space where similar functions are closer. The framework is evaluated on binary diffing and searching tasks with binaries compiled using different configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art tools by large margins in both precision and recall across cross-optimization, cross-compiler, cross-architecture, and obfuscation settings. An efficient parallel implementation is provided that uses only open-source tools. The optimization engine, bottom-up embedding construction, and high effectiveness across tasks and configurations are the key contributions.
