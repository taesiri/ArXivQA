# [VEXIR2Vec: An Architecture-Neutral Embedding Framework for Binary   Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00507)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes VexIR2Vec, a novel framework for representing binaries as vectors to solve the binary similarity problem. The key ideas are: 1) Use VEX IR, an intermediate representation from binary analysis tools like Angr, as it is architecture-neutral. 2) Decompose functions into "peepholes" across basic blocks and optimize them with a custom peephole optimization engine to simplify and normalize the IR. 3) Learn distributed representations of VEX IR entities like opcodes using knowledge graph embeddings. 4) Construct function embeddings in a bottom-up manner from these entities to avoid OOV issues. 5) Train a Siamese network with triplet loss to translate embeddings to a space where similar functions are closer. The framework is evaluated on binary diffing and searching tasks with binaries compiled using different configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art tools by large margins in both precision and recall across cross-optimization, cross-compiler, cross-architecture, and obfuscation settings. An efficient parallel implementation is provided that uses only open-source tools. The optimization engine, bottom-up embedding construction, and high effectiveness across tasks and configurations are the key contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VexIR2Vec, a novel intermediate representation based embedding framework for representing functions in binaries to solve tasks like binary diffing and searching in an architecture and application independent manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing VexIR2Vec, a novel VEX IR based embedding framework for representing binaries to find similar functions.

2) Proposing POV, a Peephole Optimization engine for VEX IR with several optimizations like copy/constant propagation, redundancy elimination etc. to normalize the IR for similarity analysis.

3) Designing VexIR2Vec embeddings that are both application and architecture independent representations. The embeddings are built bottom-up starting from the entities of the IR to avoid OOV issues and capture semantics.

4) Conducting extensive evaluations on binary diffing and searching tasks with binaries compiled using different configurations. Showing that VexIR2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both tasks.

5) Providing an efficient and scalable parallel library implementation that builds using only open-source tools. The library achieves 3.2x speedup over the closest competitor.

In summary, the main contributions are around proposing a novel VEX IR based embedding framework for binary similarity along with a custom optimization engine, and showing its effectiveness over state-of-the-art approaches.

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- VEX IR - An intermediate representation used by binary analysis tools like Valgrind and angr. The paper bases its representations on VEX IR.
