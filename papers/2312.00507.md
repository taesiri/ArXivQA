# [VEXIR2Vec: An Architecture-Neutral Embedding Framework for Binary   Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of binary code similarity - determining similar functions between two binary executables. This is an important problem with applications in areas like security, plagiarism detection, etc. However, solving this at the binary level is challenging due to differences introduced by compilers, optimizations, architectures, and obfuscations. Existing solutions have limitations in terms of scope, scalability, availability of software, and handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes VexIR2Vec, a novel framework to learn function embeddings from Valgrind's VEX IR in an architecture-neutral way. The key ideas are:

1) Extract VEX IR from binaries and break functions into smaller peepholes. Apply custom optimizations via Peephole Optimization Engine to simplify and normalize the IR.

2) Learn distributed vector representations of VEX IR entities like opcodes, operands, etc. using knowledge graph embeddings. Build function embeddings bottom-up using these entities to avoid OOV.

3) Train a Siamese network with triplet loss to map functions to vector space where similar functions are closer.

Main Contributions:

1) VexIR2Vec - An architecture and application-independent embedding framework for binary similarity

2) Peephole Optimization Engine with custom optimizations to de-clutter and simplify VEX IR

3) Technique to build function embeddings from VEX IR entities to avoid OOV

4) Extensive evaluation showing superior performance over state-of-the-art on diffing and searching tasks

5) Highly scalable parallel implementation using only open source tools, 3.2x faster than closest competitor

The solution is robust to obfuscations, cross-compiler, cross-architecture, and cross-optimization scenarios. Evaluated on real-world binaries and vulnerabilities to demonstrate practical applicability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VexIR2Vec, a novel intermediate representation-based embedding framework for representing functions in binaries to determine binary code similarity in a scalable and architecture-independent manner, using a custom peephole optimization engine and knowledge graph embeddings with a Siamese neural network.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing VexIR2Vec, a novel VEX IR based embedding framework for representing binaries to find similar functions.

2. Proposing a Peephole Optimization engine (POV) with several optimizations to normalize the VEX IR for more effective similarity analysis.

3. Designing VexIR2Vec embeddings that are both application and architecture independent representations. The embeddings are constructed bottom-up starting from the VEX IR entities to build representations of functions, avoiding OOV issues.

4. Conducting extensive evaluations showing that VexIR2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both binary diffing (by 76% average F1) and searching (by 26% average MAP) experiments across binaries with different optimizations, compilers and architectures.

5. Providing an efficient, scalable and parallel library implementation that builds on open-source tools and achieves 3.2x speedup over the closest competitor.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel VEX IR based embedding framework called VexIR2Vec for representing and finding similar binary functions, which outperforms existing approaches across various configurations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- VEX IR - An intermediate representation used by binary analysis tools like Valgrind and angr. The paper bases its approach on this IR.

- Binary similarity - The overall problem being addressed, including tasks like diffing (comparing two binaries) and searching/retrieval of similar functions.

- Embeddings - Representing code snippets like functions as continuous numerical vector representations. The paper proposes techniques to create VEX IR embeddings.

- Knowledge graphs - Modeling the VEX IR statements and components as nodes and relationships in a knowledge graph, which is then embedded.  

- Peephole optimization - A technique proposed that breaks functions into smaller windows called peepholes and optimizes the IR locally within each peephole.

- Siamese networks - The neural network architecture used for training on function embeddings, which learns to map similar functions close together.

- Diffing, searching experiments - Key experiments done to evaluate cross-compiler, cross-architecture binary similarity using metrics like precision, recall and Mean Average Precision.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new intermediate representation (IR) based embedding framework called VexIR2Vec for representing binaries. How is using IR for embeddings better than other representations like assembly instructions? What are the advantages and limitations?

2. The paper introduces a custom peephole optimization engine called POV. What are the different optimization passes applied by POV? How do they help in normalizing and simplifying the IR for binary similarity analysis?

3. The method generates function embeddings by summing embeddings of peepholes. What is the intuition behind creating and using peephole embeddings? How does it capture context better compared to using basic blocks directly?

4. The vocabulary is pre-trained using TransE which relies on modeling triplets. What are the different relations used to create these triplets from the IR? How do these relations capture syntactic and semantic information?

5. The method handles function calls by inlining the embedding of the callee function. What is the intuition behind this? How does it help summarize the behavior of the callee function? How are recursive calls handled?

6. The optimized IR is converted to a knowledge graph and embeddings are learned using TransE. Why is a knowledge graph representation suitable for the IR? What are other advanced knowledge graph embedding techniques that can be explored?

7. The model uses a Siamese network with triplet loss for training on function embeddings. What is the motivation behind using triplet loss compared to a basic binary classifier? How are the triplets sampled?

8. For the task of searching, the method finds nearest neighbors using Euclidean distance between embeddings. What are other metrics and search algorithms that can be used? Would learning a specialized metric be better?

9. The vocabulary is pre-trained only using the training set. How robust is the method in handling out-of-vocabulary terms in the test set? Are there ways to make it more robust?

10. The experiments show significant improvements over baselines in diffing and searching tasks. What are the limitations of the current evaluations? What additional experiments can be designed to thoroughly evaluate the method?
