# [FairBelief - Assessing Harmful Beliefs in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) have been shown to inherit unwanted biases that can hurt minorities if deployed without careful auditing. This can lead to issues like stereotyping, under-representation, etc. against certain groups.  
- It is challenging to align LMs to a set of beliefs, constrain them to be fair, or even define fairness concretely. Common fairness metrics also have conflicting notions of fairness.  
- Simply using existing bias measurement datasets has limitations - they may not correctly frame the phenomena or have reliability issues.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes \fairbelief, a language-agnostic framework to uncover and assess the beliefs embedded in LMs using prompting. 
- It studies model behavior across dimensions like model family, scale, likelihood of predictions, and group analysis for specific identities.
- The hurtfulness of beliefs is quantified using the HONEST score computed on language model predictions.

Key Contributions:
- Application of \fairbelief to prominent English LMs reveals they exhibit hurtful beliefs w.r.t certain gender identities.  
- Interestingly, factors like model architecture, training process, scale etc. induce beliefs with varying degrees of hurtfulness.
- Analysis shows models manifest greater hurtful beliefs for female & non-binary people compared to male identities.
- The framework enables analyzing model unfairness towards specific groups and can inform mitigation approaches.
- Future work includes probing belief malleability, causality, human judgment of beliefs etc.

In summary, the paper proposes a systematic framework \fairbelief to audit the beliefs of language models using prompting and assesses the presence of hurtful biases that should be addressed.
