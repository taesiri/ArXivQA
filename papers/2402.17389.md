# [FairBelief - Assessing Harmful Beliefs in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) have been shown to inherit unwanted biases that can hurt minorities if deployed without careful auditing. This can lead to issues like stereotyping, under-representation, etc. against certain groups.  
- It is challenging to align LMs to a set of beliefs, constrain them to be fair, or even define fairness concretely. Common fairness metrics also have conflicting notions of fairness.  
- Simply using existing bias measurement datasets has limitations - they may not correctly frame the phenomena or have reliability issues.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes \fairbelief, a language-agnostic framework to uncover and assess the beliefs embedded in LMs using prompting. 
- It studies model behavior across dimensions like model family, scale, likelihood of predictions, and group analysis for specific identities.
- The hurtfulness of beliefs is quantified using the HONEST score computed on language model predictions.

Key Contributions:
- Application of \fairbelief to prominent English LMs reveals they exhibit hurtful beliefs w.r.t certain gender identities.  
- Interestingly, factors like model architecture, training process, scale etc. induce beliefs with varying degrees of hurtfulness.
- Analysis shows models manifest greater hurtful beliefs for female & non-binary people compared to male identities.
- The framework enables analyzing model unfairness towards specific groups and can inform mitigation approaches.
- Future work includes probing belief malleability, causality, human judgment of beliefs etc.

In summary, the paper proposes a systematic framework \fairbelief to audit the beliefs of language models using prompting and assesses the presence of hurtful biases that should be addressed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FairBelief, an analytical approach to uncover and assess potentially harmful beliefs embedded in language models through prompting and analyzing model outputs using the HONEST fairness metric.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing FairBelief, an analytical approach to capture and assess potentially harmful beliefs embedded in language models. Specifically:

- FairBelief leverages prompting to study the behavior of several state-of-the-art language models across different scales and likelihoods using the HONEST dataset. 

- It analyzes language models across dimensions like model family/scale, likelihood of predictions, and group analysis for different identities.

- Through experiments on English language models, FairBelief reveals that while these models enable high performance on NLP tasks, they show hurtful beliefs about specific genders. 

- Factors like model architecture, scale, and training procedure induce beliefs of varying degrees of hurtfulness.

In summary, FairBelief enables analyzing and quantifying the hurtfulness of beliefs in language models to facilitate auditing them for fairness. The goal is to mitigate the risk of propagating harmful stereotypes and biases when these models are integrated into real-world applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Language models (LMs)
- Beliefs 
- Prompting
- Fairness auditing
- Hurtfulness
- Biases
- Stereotyping
- HONEST score
- Representational harms
- Marginalized groups
- Discrimination
- Fairness datasets
- Identity terms
- Likelihood analysis  
- Model scale analysis

The paper introduces the concept of "beliefs" that are embedded in language models, and how they can propagate harmful stereotypes or biases against marginalized groups. It proposes an analytical framework called "FairBelief" to assess the hurtfulness of language models' beliefs using prompting and analyzing factors like model family, scale, likelihood, and identities. The analysis relies on the HONEST benchmark and score to quantify harm. Both quantitative analyses using the score, as well as qualitative analyses of model outputs are conducted. The goal is to audit models for fairness and mitigate representation harms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "beliefs" embedded in language models. How does this concept differ from traditional notions of bias and fairness? What new insights does it provide into understanding and mitigating issues with language models?

2. The HONEST score is used as the primary metric for evaluating model beliefs. What are the strengths and limitations of this metric? How could it be improved or supplemented to provide a more comprehensive view of model beliefs? 

3. The analysis examines beliefs across several dimensions like model family, scale, likelihood, and identity group. What other potential dimensions could be explored to further understand variations in model beliefs?

4. The qualitative analysis reveals issues like stereotyping and objectification in model predictions. What other types of problematic beliefs might be uncovered through more extensive qualitative analysis? How could the analysis approach be expanded?

5. The paper finds modern model families like VICUNA exhibit more hurtful beliefs. What properties of these models might account for this? How could they be altered to mitigate such beliefs?  

6. Larger models do not necessarily exhibit less hurtful beliefs. Why might increased scale not reduce harmful beliefs as expected? What interventions beyond scale could help?

7. The likelihood analysis shows hurtful beliefs manifest at high likelihoods. What does this reveal about the training data and process for models with such behaviors? How could data curation be improved?

8. The group analysis finds higher diversity of beliefs for some identities over others. Why might this occur and how could models be made more equitable across groups?  

9. What are some ways the prompting approach could be expanded, for example using soft prompts, to better analyze and potentially alter model beliefs?

10. What kind of participatory research with stakeholders could help evaluate real-world impacts of the beliefs uncovered? How should findings guide development of safer, more equitable NLP models?
