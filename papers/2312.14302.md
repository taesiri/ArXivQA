# [Exploiting Novel GPT-4 APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14302)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores novel vulnerabilities introduced in the recently released GPT-4 APIs for fine-tuning, function calling, and knowledge retrieval, finding they enable new attacks like targeted misinformation, privacy violations, injection of malicious code, and hijacking of functions or knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper demonstrates several novel attacks exploiting new capabilities recently added to the GPT-4 API, specifically fine-tuning, function calling, and knowledge retrieval. Through red team testing, the authors show that these new features can enable GPT-4 models to engage in harmful behaviors like generating misinformation, leaking private data, assisting with cyberattacks, etc. The results highlight that expanding the functionality of large language model APIs introduces new vulnerabilities, even in a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4 that has strong baseline safety capabilities. The authors argue this underscores the need for rigorous security testing when new features are added to AI systems, especially those that increase capabilities or affordances. Overall, it serves as an in-depth case study revealing dangers from novel APIs and provides guidance to AI developers on adversarially robust design.

The paper focuses on red teaming or penetration testing new capabilities enabled by novel GPT-4 APIs like fine-tuning, function calling, and knowledge retrieval. It uncovers vulnerabilities that allow for targeted misinformation, bypassing of safety guardrails, arbitrary code execution, and prompt injections. Both malicious and accidental threats are analyzed through data poisoning or prompt engineering. Overall, the key themes are around assessing and improving the security of next-generation language models as they gain new capabilities through public APIs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The authors demonstrate attacks on three novel GPT-4 APIs: fine-tuning, function calling, and knowledge retrieval. Which of these vulnerabilities seems most concerning in terms of potential for real-world harm if exploited at scale? Explain your reasoning.

2. When fine-tuning GPT-4 models, the authors find both malicious and benign datasets can undermine built-in safety measures. What implications might this have for the risks of inadvertent harms from user-generated fine-tuning data?

3. The targeted misinformation experiments involve fine-tuning on just 15-60 examples. Could you design an experiment to test if even less data (1-5 examples) might suffice to induce harmful biases? What challenges do you anticipate?  

4. The authors use mix harmless examples into datasets to bypass OpenAI's content moderation. What alternative strategies could OpenAI employ to better detect poisons datasets blended with innocuous data? How might adversarial techniques be employed against your proposed solutions?

5. When attacking the function calling API, the authors demonstrate automated attacks using SQL injection payloads. What other types of function input validation failures might be automatically exploitable? How would you systematize discovery and exploitation of additional vulnerabilities?

6. The knowledge retrieval injection attacks rely on overriding the assistant's summarization abilities. What other API features could potentially be exploited via injected instructions to produce unintended and harmful behavior?    

7. The authors were unable to bypass safety restrictions by treating function outputs or documents as more authoritative than user inputs. Can you conceive alternative methods that might succeed at this? If possible, provide technical specifics rather than general ideas.

8. The authors performed limited automation of attacks using generative models to create inputs. How might a more sophisticated red teaming system automate reconnaissance, chaining together multiple vulnerabilities, and production of more Targeted and contextual malicious outputs? 

9. The authors evaluated model outputs themselves for harmfulness. What alternative strategies could help better quantify real-world impact? How sufficient are abstract harmfulness ratings alone for policy decisions on risky technologies?

10. What additional experiments would you design to further test the robustness of protections against inadvertently training gravely misaligned models via fine-tuning or data poisoning? What Failure modes concern you despite lack of current evidence?
