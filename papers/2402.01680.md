## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning and planning capabilities when used as single agents. However, multi-agent systems based on LLMs can achieve even more advanced capabilities by specializing LLMs into distinct agents and enabling them to interact and collaborate. This emerging field of LLM-based multi-agents (LLM-MA) is rapidly progressing with new methodologies and applications across diverse domains. However, there has been no systematic review summarizing progress, establishing a comprehensive blueprint, and examining future challenges. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents a survey reviewing the progress in LLM-MA systems. It provides a taxonomy dissecting LLM-MA systems across four key aspects: 
1) Agents-environment interface: How agents interact with the task environment
2) Agent profiling: How agents are characterized by LLMs to behave in certain ways
3) Agent communication: How agents exchange messages and collaborate 
4) Agent capability acquisition: How agents develop abilities to effectively solve problems

The paper also categorizes LLM-MA applications into problem-solving and world simulation. It summarizes commonly used datasets, benchmarks, and open-source frameworks. Finally, it discusses key challenges and future opportunities.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive taxonomy characterizing intricacies of LLM-MA systems 
- Review of agent interfaces, profiling methods, communication paradigms/structures, and capability acquisition
- Categorization of LLM-MA applications into problem-solving and world simulation
- Summary of datasets, benchmarks, and frameworks commonly used in LLM-MA research
- Identification of challenges and opportunities, including scaling laws, evaluation methods, potential applications, and theoretical perspectives

Overall, this paper serves as a founding survey offering researchers across disciplines a useful resource to understand progress in LLM-MA systems and guiding future explorations in this rapidly evolving field.
