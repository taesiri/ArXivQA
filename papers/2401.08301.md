# [Sum Throughput Maximization in Multi-BD Symbiotic Radio NOMA Network   Assisted by Active-STAR-RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper aims to address two key challenges for enabling massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity: spectrum scarcity and energy efficiency. Traditional solutions like cognitive radio and backscatter communication have limitations. This paper proposes using symbiotic radio (SR) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to overcome these limitations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a commensal symbiotic radio (CSR) network assisted by an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (ASRIS). The network has a base station (BS) with massive MIMO, multiple symbiotic backscatter devices (SBDs) and symbiotic user equipments (SUEs).

In the first phase, the BS transmits ambient signals to the SBDs using NOMA. The SBDs harvest energy from these signals to power their circuits, modulate their own information on the carrier, and backscatter the signals to the BS. 

In the second phase, the BS uses maximal ratio combining, successive interference cancellation and beamforming to forward the SBD signals to intended SUEs. The ASRIS assists by providing coverage to SUEs without line-of-sight to BS and amplifying signals for other SUEs.

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum throughput by optimizing scheduling between the two phases, ASRIS beamforming, SBD reflection coefficients and BS beamforming. 

Deep reinforcement learning methods like PPO, TD3 and A3C are used to solve this non-convex optimization problem.

Main Contributions:

1) A practical system model for information exchange between active and passive users using CSR and ASRIS.

2) Problem formulation to maximize sum throughput under energy harvesting, QoS and SIC constraints.

3) Using advanced DRL techniques to model and solve the non-convex optimization problem.

4) Performance comparison of PPO, TD3 and A3C methods, with A3C showing fastest convergence and highest throughput.

5) Demonstrating significant gains of using ASRIS over passive RIS.

In summary, the paper makes meaningful contributions in modeling, optimization and performance analysis of ASRIS-assisted CSR networks for future IoT connectivity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an active STAR-RIS assisted symbiotic radio network with massive MIMO to maximize sum throughput among passive IoT devices and active users through optimal resource allocation using deep reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes an innovative and comprehensive system model that includes multiple active and passive users exchanging information, using technologies like massive MIMO, ASRIS, backscatter communication, and NOMA. 

2) It formulates an optimization problem to maximize the sum throughput rate across all users, under practical constraints like minimum QoS, maximum transmit power limits, energy harvesting limits for devices, and SIC requirements.  

3) It employs and compares three deep reinforcement learning methods - PPO, TD3 and A3C - to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Through simulations, it shows that A3C achieves the fastest convergence and highest overall throughput.

4) It demonstrates via results that using an active STAR-RIS structure leads to significantly higher throughput compared to a passive STAR-RIS structure in this system.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel system design and problem formulation for an ASRIS-assisted symbiotic radio network, along with the application of DRL techniques to optimize throughput performance. The comparisons between active/passive STAR-RIS and different DRL methods are also valuable contributions.
