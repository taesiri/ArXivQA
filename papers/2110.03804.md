# [FOCUS: Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03804)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How do deep learning image classification models perform on images containing familiar objects in uncommon or atypical environments/settings, and can their ability to classify such images be improved?The key points are:- Standard image datasets used to train deep learning models often do not contain many examples of objects in uncommon settings (e.g. planes on water, cars in snow). - This can cause models to rely too heavily on contextual cues and have poor generalizability to uncommon settings.- The authors introduce a new dataset called FOCUS containing images of familiar objects in both common and uncommon settings.- They evaluate several popular deep learning models on FOCUS and find a significant drop in accuracy on uncommon images.- Finetuning the models on FOCUS improves their ability to classify objects in uncommon settings.So in summary, the main question is whether deep learning models can accurately classify familiar objects in uncommon settings, and if their performance on such uncommon cases can be improved via finetuning on a dataset containing more diversity. The FOCUS dataset and experiments are aimed at addressing this question.
