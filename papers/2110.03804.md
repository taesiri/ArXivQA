# [FOCUS: Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03804)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How do deep learning image classification models perform on images containing familiar objects in uncommon or atypical environments/settings, and can their ability to classify such images be improved?

The key points are:

- Standard image datasets used to train deep learning models often do not contain many examples of objects in uncommon settings (e.g. planes on water, cars in snow). 

- This can cause models to rely too heavily on contextual cues and have poor generalizability to uncommon settings.

- The authors introduce a new dataset called FOCUS containing images of familiar objects in both common and uncommon settings.

- They evaluate several popular deep learning models on FOCUS and find a significant drop in accuracy on uncommon images.

- Finetuning the models on FOCUS improves their ability to classify objects in uncommon settings.

So in summary, the main question is whether deep learning models can accurately classify familiar objects in uncommon settings, and if their performance on such uncommon cases can be improved via finetuning on a dataset containing more diversity. The FOCUS dataset and experiments are aimed at addressing this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new dataset called FOCUS (Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings) to evaluate deep learning image classifiers. The key ideas are:

- Leveraging search engines to deliberately gather images with objects in both common and uncommon settings like locations, weather conditions, and time of day.

- Using FOCUS to evaluate popular ImageNet classifiers and finding they perform significantly worse on uncommon images, demonstrating insufficient generalization. 

- Showing that finetuning on FOCUS improves models' ability to focus on the object of interest, leading to better accuracy on uncommon images.

- Using FOCUS to add rich context annotations (time, weather, location) to the whole ImageNet dataset.

In summary, the paper introduces FOCUS as a dataset to stress test generalization of classifiers to uncommon settings, reveals poor generalization of popular models, and shows finetuning on FOCUS improves generalization. The dataset and annotations also enable future work on improving model robustness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FOCUS, a dataset of natural images containing common and uncommon settings to evaluate the ability of deep learning image classifiers to generalize to atypical contexts; the authors find popular classifiers have reduced performance on uncommon settings which is improved by fine-tuning on FOCUS.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper focuses on studying the ability of deep learning models to classify images containing common objects in uncommon contexts or settings. This is an important but understudied problem, as most existing image datasets contain biases towards objects in their typical contexts.

- The paper introduces a new dataset called FOCUS specifically designed to have a balanced distribution of objects in both common and uncommon settings. Most prior work has studied model robustness using artificial image corruptions or synthetic distribution shifts. FOCUS provides more natural distribution shifts.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates many recent state-of-the-art image classifiers on FOCUS and shows they have substantially reduced accuracy on uncommon images, highlighting their lack of robustness. Prior work has not systematically studied such a wide range of models.

- The paper shows that finetuning on FOCUS significantly improves model accuracy on uncommon settings. This demonstrates that datasets like FOCUS can be used to improve model generalization. Most prior work has focused only on evaluating models rather than improving them.

- The paper uses FOCUS to add richer contextual attribute labels to ImageNet, facilitating future large-scale studies. Expanding datasets with contextual attributes has not been explored much before.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions in rigorously benchmarking model robustness on natural distribution shifts and demonstrating how targeted datasets can diagnose and improve model biases. The comparisons to other datasets and breadth of models evaluated also move forward the understanding in this problem space.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improve the distributional robustness and generalization ability of deep learning models to uncommon settings. The FOCUS dataset could be used to develop models that are more robust to rare contexts.

- Better understand the reasons behind deep models' inability to generalize well to uncommon contexts. The authors suggest analysis of deep features and visualizations like Grad-CAM could provide more insight. 

- Develop techniques to reduce reliance on spurious correlations between objects and contexts. The authors suggest their analysis shows models exploit these shortcuts, hurting generalization. New methods could help models focus on the object.

- Expand existing datasets like ImageNet with richer context annotations, as the authors did using FOCUS. More contextual diversity in training data could improve generalization.

- Design better evaluation metrics and benchmarks to measure out-of-distribution model performance. FOCUS provides a starting point but more comprehensive tests are needed.

- Study the differences in human and machine reliance on context for classification. Understanding similarities and differences could inspire new techniques.

In summary, the main directions are: improving generalization through novel models or training regimes, gaining further insight into model failures, expanding datasets to reduce distribution gaps, and developing better evaluation methods for out-of-distribution settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces FOCUS, a dataset for evaluating image classifiers on their ability to identify objects in uncommon settings. The key ideas are:

- Standard image datasets like ImageNet lack diversity in the environments objects appear in. Most images show objects in their typical, common settings. This causes models to rely too much on context and fail on atypical, uncommon images.

- FOCUS contains around 21K images of 10 object classes in a variety of common and uncommon settings like different times of day, weather conditions, and locations. Images are annotated with these attributes. 

- Popular ImageNet classifiers like ResNet50 and EfficientNet are evaluated on FOCUS. All models show significantly reduced accuracy on uncommon images, indicating they overly rely on context. Finetuning on FOCUS improves accuracy in uncommon settings.

- FOCUS is used to train classifiers to predict contextual attributes. These are applied to add rich annotations of time, weather, location to all ImageNet images.

- The authors argue FOCUS can help develop models that reliably identify objects in both common and uncommon settings. The dataset and evaluations highlight shortcomings of current models and provide a benchmark to drive progress.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces FOCUS, a new dataset for evaluating the ability of image classifiers to generalize to uncommon settings. The authors argue that existing datasets like ImageNet contain mostly images of objects in their common contexts (e.g. planes flying, cars on roads). As a result, models trained on these datasets may rely too heavily on contextual cues and fail to classify objects correctly when they appear in uncommon or rare contexts. 

To address this, the FOCUS dataset contains around 21,000 images covering 10 object classes from CIFAR-10. The images are annotated with time of day, weather, and location attributes, with a deliberate focus on gathering uncommon combinations (e.g. planes on water, cars in the snow). The authors demonstrate that several popular ImageNet classifiers suffer a significant drop in accuracy on uncommon images from FOCUS. Further experiments show that fine-tuning on FOCUS can substantially improve a model's ability to focus on the object itself, rather than the context, leading to better generalization. The paper concludes that datasets like FOCUS can reveal weaknesses in generalization and drive progress on building more robust models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new dataset called FOCUS (Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings) for evaluating the generalization ability of image classifiers to uncommon settings. 

The key idea is to leverage modern search engines to explicitly collect images of objects in both common environments (e.g. planes in sky, cars on roads) as well as uncommon environments (e.g. planes on water, cars on snow). This is done by querying for objects along with descriptors of various environments like "plane on water". 

The authors collect around 21K images covering 10 object classes from CIFAR-10 with annotations for time of day, weather, and location. Certain (object, environment) pairs like (plane, water) are categorized as uncommon based on their rarity in real world as well as in other datasets like ImageNet. 

Using FOCUS, the authors evaluate several popular classifiers like ResNet50, EfficientNet, etc. pre-trained on ImageNet. They observe significant drops in accuracy on uncommon images, indicating poor generalization. Finetuning on FOCUS is shown to improve accuracy on uncommon settings. The authors also use FOCUS to train attribute classifiers and annotate 1.2M Images in ImageNet with time, weather and location.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Standard image datasets used for training deep learning models often lack diversity in the environments and contexts in which objects appear. For example, most images of ships are on water, cars are on roads, etc.

- This can cause models to rely too heavily on contextual cues and fail to generalize to uncommon or atypical environments like ships indoors or cars on sand.

- The authors introduce a new dataset called FOCUS (Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings) which deliberately contains images of objects in both common and uncommon environmental contexts.

- FOCUS has around 21K images across 10 object classes with annotations for time of day, weather, and location. Some contexts are marked as common or uncommon for each object class.

- Popular deep learning models like ResNet50, EfficientNet, etc. all show significant drops in accuracy when evaluated on FOCUS images in uncommon contexts.

- Finetuning on FOCUS improves model accuracy on uncommon contexts, showing it helps improve generalization.

- FOCUS is also used to add environmental context annotations to all of ImageNet to enable future work.

So in summary, the key problem is that standard datasets lack diversity of contexts and this causes poor generalization. FOCUS is introduced to help expose and mitigate this problem.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces FOCUS, a new dataset for evaluating the distributional robustness of image classifiers. The key idea is that existing datasets like ImageNet contain mostly images of objects in their typical or common settings. For example, ships are usually on water, cars are on streets, etc. However, real-world images can contain objects in uncommon or atypical settings as well (e.g. a plane on water). FOCUS contains around 21K carefully curated images of 10 common object classes in both common and uncommon settings. The images are annotated with attributes like time of day, weather, and location. Using FOCUS, the authors evaluate several standard ImageNet classifiers and show a significant drop in accuracy on uncommon images versus common ones, indicating poor generalization. Further, finetuning on FOCUS leads to large gains in accuracy on uncommon test images. The authors also use FOCUS to train attribute classifiers to annotate all of ImageNet with time, weather, and location attributes. Overall, FOCUS enables studying if classifiers merely exploit spurious correlations between objects and contexts or if they genuinely understand objects. The authors believe that datasets like FOCUS are crucial for developing deep learning models that are reliable in both common and rare situations.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces FOCUS, a new dataset for evaluating the ability of image classifiers to generalize to uncommon settings. The authors collect around 21K images depicting 10 common object classes (categories in CIFAR-10) in a variety of environments, including different times of day, weather conditions, and locations. Each image is annotated with labels for these attributes, distinguishing between common and uncommon settings for each object class. Using FOCUS, the authors evaluate several popular deep learning models pretrained on ImageNet and find a significant drop in accuracy when classifying objects in uncommon settings. Finetuning these models on FOCUS substantially improves their ability to focus on and correctly classify the objects of interest even in uncommon contexts. The authors also use FOCUS to train attribute classifiers that can annotate the entire ImageNet dataset with the contextual attributes considered in FOCUS. Overall, this work demonstrates that existing image classifiers struggle to generalize to uncommon environments and introduces a new dataset that can be used for improving model robustness across different contexts and settings.
