# [What Do Dialect Speakers Want? A Survey of Attitudes Towards Language   Technology for German Dialects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most natural language processing (NLP) research has focused on standardized languages. There is now increasing interest in local, non-standardized languages and dialects. However, it is largely unknown what tools and applications speakers of such varieties would actually find useful. 

Solution:
The authors survey 327 speakers of German dialects and regional languages to understand their attitudes towards hypothetical language technologies tailored to their dialects. The survey asks participants to rate the usefulness of several technologies on a 5-point scale, including machine translation to/from the dialect, speech recognition and synthesis, spell checkers, search engines, chatbots, and virtual assistants.

Key Findings:
- Overall, respondents prefer technologies processing dialect input (e.g. assistants responding to dialect questions) over those producing dialect output. They also tend to favor speech over text processing.
- The most popular hypothetical tools are virtual assistants understanding dialectal input (71% approval) and speech recognition into standard German (61%). 
- Respondents are especially skeptical of technologies creating dialect output like machine translation (25-52% approval depending on direction) and text-to-speech (47% approval).
- Subgroup analysis shows language activists, Low German speakers and Swiss respondents tend to have more positive attitudes towards dialect technology compared to other groups.

Main Contributions:
- First survey investigating speaker communities' perspectives on language technology for dialects and minority languages related to German
- Highlights the heterogeneity in attitudes across groups; input vs output and speech vs text are important dimensions
- Provides guidance on promising and controversial types of applications for under-resourced language varieties

The paper therefore surveys speaker attitudes to determine which technologies should be prioritized when aiming to create useful applications tailored to the language use of minority speech communities.
