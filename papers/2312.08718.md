# [Motion Planning and Control of Hybrid Flying-Crawling Quadrotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08718)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a motion planning and control framework for Hybrid Flying-Crawling Quadrotors (HyFCQs) - transformable robots capable of both aerial and terrestrial locomotion. The framework enables autonomous navigation in complex environments. First, the terrestrial path-searching method in the hybrid planner is optimized by incorporating crawling constraints like limited turning radius. This ensures feasible trajectories for ground movement. Next, a hierarchical controller maps the flight autopilot's control outputs to crawling and flying modes for precise tracking. Additionally, a motion state machine manages transitions between motion states and locomotion modes based on the trajectory, facilitating smooth autonomous mode switching. Real-world experiments validate the framework's capabilities, as HyFCQs autonomously navigated terrain containing obstacles and narrow passages, crawled around obstructions, and flew over barriers necessitating mode transitions. In sum, this comprehensive motion planning and control solution enables robust autonomous navigation leveraging the hybrid mobility of HyFCQs.
