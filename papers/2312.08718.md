# [Motion Planning and Control of Hybrid Flying-Crawling Quadrotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08718)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a motion planning and control framework for Hybrid Flying-Crawling Quadrotors (HyFCQs) - transformable robots capable of both aerial and terrestrial locomotion. The framework enables autonomous navigation in complex environments. First, the terrestrial path-searching method in the hybrid planner is optimized by incorporating crawling constraints like limited turning radius. This ensures feasible trajectories for ground movement. Next, a hierarchical controller maps the flight autopilot's control outputs to crawling and flying modes for precise tracking. Additionally, a motion state machine manages transitions between motion states and locomotion modes based on the trajectory, facilitating smooth autonomous mode switching. Real-world experiments validate the framework's capabilities, as HyFCQs autonomously navigated terrain containing obstacles and narrow passages, crawled around obstructions, and flew over barriers necessitating mode transitions. In sum, this comprehensive motion planning and control solution enables robust autonomous navigation leveraging the hybrid mobility of HyFCQs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hybrid flying-crawling quadrotors (HyFCQs) are aerial-ground robots with the ability to transition between flying and crawling locomotion. This allows them to combine the mobility of aerial motion with the efficiency and robustness of ground motion.
- However, existing research has focused more on the mechanical design rather than the autonomous navigation capabilities. There are several challenges in developing motion planning and control frameworks tailored for HyFCQs:
  1) Ensuring crawler trajectories are feasible given turning radius constraints
  2) Mapping control outputs from the flight autopilot to both aerial and crawling motion
  3) Smooth transitioning between crawling, flying and transitionary states

Proposed Solution:
- A motion planning and control framework specifically designed for HyFCQs, enabling fully autonomous navigation. Main components:
  1) Hybrid motion planner: 
     - Kinodynamic path searching optimized with "crawling refinement" to guarantee feasible curves
     - Handles transition from ground to aerial trajectories
  2) Hierarchical motion controller:  
     - Maps control outputs from flight autopilot to control either flying or crawling
     - Adaptive throttle control for stable crawling
  3) Motion state machine:
     - Classifies motion into distinct states (ground/hover, takeoff, aerial, etc) 
     - Coordinates transitions between motion states based on trajectory

Main Contributions:
- A hybrid motion planner that incorporates crawling constraints into terrestrial path searching to guarantee dynamic feasibility
- A hierarchical controller that maps the flight autopilot to different actuations for both flying and crawling modes
- A motion state machine that autonomously selects suitable locomotion and manages transitions based on trajectory

The proposed framework is integrated into a full navigation system. Real-world experiments demonstrate the HyFCQ autonomously navigating various environments requiring hybrid crawling-flying motions. This shows the framework enables robust trajectory tracking and smooth state transitions during hybrid navigation.
