# [Asking the Right Question at the Right Time: Human and Model Uncertainty   Guidance to Ask Clarification Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Asking clarification questions is an important capability for dialogue systems to resolve uncertainties and ambiguities, but modern neural network models still struggle with generating effective clarification questions.  
- Some existing approaches train models on human clarification behavior, but there is variability in human strategies. Other approaches use model uncertainty, but the relationship between model and human uncertainty is unclear.

Proposed Solution:
- Use the CoDraw visual dialogue task as a testbed to study model uncertainty and its relationship to human uncertainty regarding asking clarification questions. 
- Propose different ways to estimate model uncertainty and analyze its correlation with human clarification behavior. Find poor correlation, possibly due to inconsistent human strategies.
- Propose an uncertainty-based clarification module for the Drawer agent that generates templated clarification questions about object size when model uncertainty exceeds a threshold. Allows controlling number of questions by tuning the threshold.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing poor correlation between model uncertainty and human clarification behavior in CoDraw.
- Proposed uncertainty-driven clarification module that significantly outperforms baselines in task accuracy, including a model trained on human clarification behavior. 
- Demonstrates the benefit of using model's own uncertainty to trigger clarification questions. Highlights importance of equipping dialogue agents with uncertainty estimation abilities.

In summary, the paper studies model uncertainty in CoDraw dialogues, reveals poor correlation with inconsistent human strategies, and shows that using model uncertainty to generate clarification questions leads to improved task performance over alternatives. Key contribution is highlighting the usefulness of model uncertainty for dialogue agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates uncertainty-driven strategies for generating clarification questions in collaborative agents, comparing model uncertainty to human behavior and finding better task success by equipping agents to assess and exploit their own uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing an approach for generating clarification questions in conversational agents based on model uncertainty estimation. Specifically:

- The paper studies the relationship between model uncertainty and human uncertainty in the CoDraw collaborative dialogue task. It finds that the two are poorly correlated, possibly due to variability in human clarification strategies. 

- The paper proposes an uncertainty-driven Questioning Drawer (QDrawer) agent that asks clarification questions about object size when its uncertainty exceeds a threshold. This approach allows controlling the number of questions asked.

- Experiments show that the uncertainty-based QDrawer significantly outperforms baselines in terms of task success. This highlights the importance of equipping agents with the ability to assess and act upon their own uncertainty through effective clarification questions.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an uncertainty-based method for generating clarification questions in conversational agents and demonstrating its effectiveness compared to alternatives, including models trained on human clarification behavior, in a collaborative dialogue setting. The paper also provides analysis into the relationship between human and model uncertainty.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using model uncertainty to decide when to generate clarification questions. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using human clarification behavior as supervision?

2. The paper finds that model uncertainty correlates poorly with human uncertainty in the CoDraw task. What are some possible explanations for this poor correlation that are discussed? How could this be further investigated? 

3. The paper uses a template-based approach to generate clarification questions about the size attribute. What are the trade-offs with this simplified approach? How could a more sophisticated question generation method be incorporated while still isolating the effect of clarification?

4. What metrics are used to represent different types of model uncertainty in the CoDraw task (clipart selection, size, orientation, position)? How are these computed and what challenges are discussed regarding position uncertainty?  

5. How is the Questioning Drawer model adapted from the Silent Drawer model? What changes are made to the loss function and why?

6. What baselines is the Questioning Drawer compared against? What are the key differences between the uncertainty-based approach and the alternatives like using a Decider module?

7. The number of questions asked is controlled by varying a threshold hyperparameter. What is this and what effect does it have on the percentage of dialogues with questions and number of questions per dialogue?   

8. What calibration metrics are used to analyze the effect of clarification questions? How do these metrics change from the Silent to the Questioning Drawer?

9. What are some of the key limitations discussed regarding the generalization of this approach to other tasks and architectures? What additional factors would need to be considered?

10. How could this approach of using model uncertainty for clarification be extended to other attributes like orientation? What challenges might this introduce?
