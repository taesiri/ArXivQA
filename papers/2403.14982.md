# [MasonTigers at SemEval-2024 Task 9: Solving Puzzles with an Ensemble of   Chain-of-Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14982)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores the challenge of solving complex reasoning puzzles which require multi-step inference and deduction. Such elaborative reasoning problems remain difficult for current NLP systems. The paper specifically looks at the new BrainTeaser dataset which contains word and sentence puzzles needing creative thinking.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper uses large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and applies prompting strategies to map the puzzles into conditional text that guides the reasoning process. The key method is "chain-of-thought" prompting which breaks down the deduction step-by-step into logical simplified steps. Experiments compare zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.

Main Contributions:
- Shows promise of prompted LLMs for solving reasoning puzzles when provided explanatory prompts 
- Performance improves with more steps/specificity in prompts
- Ensemble approach over multiple chain-of-thought prompts gives best results
- Achieves highly competitive rankings on the leaderboard (2nd on word, 13th on sentence puzzles)
- Sheds light on latent reasoning potential of LLMs when given structured thought process
- Highlights need for automating prompting process and overcoming architectural constraints

In summary, the paper demonstrates that by decomposing reasoning into an explanatory chain of thought, strong puzzle solving abilities can be unlocked in large language models. The approach points to the future possibilities of guided reasoning with LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents team MasonTigers' approach of using prompted large language models, especially with chain-of-thought prompting and ensembles, to solve complex reasoning puzzles from the BrainTeaser dataset, achieving highly competitive performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper explores various prompting strategies, especially chain-of-thought prompting, to guide large language models to solve complex reasoning puzzles from the BrainTeaser dataset. The key method involves iteratively breaking down the reasoning process into simplified logical steps to improve the models' deduction abilities. Through experiments with different prompting approaches and model ensembles, the paper shows that providing explanatory prompts can substantially unlock the reasoning potential in large language models. The system achieves highly competitive performance, ranking 2nd on word puzzles and 13th on sentence puzzles in the SemEval-2024 Task 9 challenge. The work provides insights into how structured thought process prompts can elicit more of the knowledge encoded within the parameters of large models.

In summary, the main contribution is using guided prompting strategies, particularly chain-of-thought prompting, to enable large language models to solve elaborate reasoning puzzles that require multi-step inference.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using both proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 as well as open-source models like Mixtral. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using proprietary vs open-source models for a task like this? 

2. The chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting approach iteratively breaks down reasoning into logical steps. How does this compare to other step-wise reasoning approaches like tree-of-thought or proof-of-thought? What are the relative merits?

3. The paper shows performance improves with more CoT steps and specificity. Is there a risk of overfitting with too many iterative prompt steps? How can we determine the optimal level of prompting? 

4. What types of puzzles or questions seem particularly challenging or resistant to solving through CoT prompting? What adjustments could make them more amenable to this approach?

5. The ensemble methodology helps improve robustness and confidence in the predictions. But how do we ensure diversity in the prompts to avoid correlated errors across ensemble components? 

6. How transferrable is this CoT prompting approach to other complex reasoning tasks beyond these specific puzzles and brainteasers? What adaptations would be required?

7. The paper mentions architectural constraints related to memory and reasoning as limitations. What specific architectural innovations could better support multi-step deductive reasoning?  

8. Is there a risk of the CoT prompts injecting human biases or incorrect reasoning? How do we verify logical soundness at each step?

9. How does the performance compare when CoT prompting is done in natural language compared to a more structured, logical format? What are the tradeoffs?

10. What other prompting approaches or techniques could complement or enhance CoT prompting? How can we combine methods to maximize performance?
