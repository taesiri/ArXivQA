# [MasonTigers at SemEval-2024 Task 9: Solving Puzzles with an Ensemble of   Chain-of-Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14982)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores the challenge of solving complex reasoning puzzles which require multi-step inference and deduction. Such elaborative reasoning problems remain difficult for current NLP systems. The paper specifically looks at the new BrainTeaser dataset which contains word and sentence puzzles needing creative thinking.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper uses large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and applies prompting strategies to map the puzzles into conditional text that guides the reasoning process. The key method is "chain-of-thought" prompting which breaks down the deduction step-by-step into logical simplified steps. Experiments compare zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.

Main Contributions:
- Shows promise of prompted LLMs for solving reasoning puzzles when provided explanatory prompts 
- Performance improves with more steps/specificity in prompts
- Ensemble approach over multiple chain-of-thought prompts gives best results
- Achieves highly competitive rankings on the leaderboard (2nd on word, 13th on sentence puzzles)
- Sheds light on latent reasoning potential of LLMs when given structured thought process
- Highlights need for automating prompting process and overcoming architectural constraints

In summary, the paper demonstrates that by decomposing reasoning into an explanatory chain of thought, strong puzzle solving abilities can be unlocked in large language models. The approach points to the future possibilities of guided reasoning with LLMs.
