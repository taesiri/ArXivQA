## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
Autonomous driving systems require vast amounts of diverse and high-quality data to ensure safety in complex real-world environments. However, collecting real-world data is expensive, time-consuming and has potential safety risks. Existing simulators have limitations in terms of photorealism, customizability and scalability. There is a need for a simulator that can generate high-fidelity, customizable and scalable autonomous driving data.

Proposed Solution 
The paper proposes OASim, an open and adaptive simulator for generating high-fidelity autonomous driving data using neural implicit reconstruction and rendering. The key aspects of OASim are:

1. Photorealistic environment reconstruction using neural implicit surface techniques like StreetSurf. Static background and dynamic foreground objects are modeled separately.

2. Interactive visualization interface to edit ego vehicle trajectory, simulate traffic flows and vehicle interactions. Different sensor configurations can also be selected.

3. Customizable data generation system that can synthesize diverse sensor data (cameras, LiDAR, radar) based on customized trajectories and sensor parameters.

4. Downstream applications in perception, planning, closed-loop testing etc. by generating rare corner cases.

Main Contributions
The main contributions of the paper are:

1. High-fidelity neural implicit reconstruction and real-time rendering of complex outdoor driving scenes with moving objects.

2. Flexible interactive interface for editing trajectories, simulating interactions and configuring sensor parameters.

3. Customizable data generation capabilities to create diverse sensor data for various downstream tasks.

4. Open source system that can work with custom or public autonomous driving datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes OASim, a highly customizable, photorealistic and scalable simulator for autonomous driving based on neural rendering. It provides an interactive interface and can generate high-fidelity sensor data for testing and validating autonomous driving systems.
