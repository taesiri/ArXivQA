# [Desigen: A Pipeline for Controllable Design Template Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Desigen: A Pipeline for Controllable Design Template Generation":

Problem:
- Design templates (e.g. banners, slides) serve as good starting points for users to create designs, but manually creating templates requires great effort from designers. 
- Existing text-to-image (T2I) models have limited spatial control to generate appropriate backgrounds with empty space for overlaying layout elements using only text descriptions. 
- Current layout generation methods focus solely on synthesizing layouts conditioned on given backgrounds without considering interactive refinement between backgrounds and layouts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Desigen, a pipeline for automatic design template generation, consisting of a background generator and a layout generator.

Background Generator:
- Extends T2I models with two techniques for stronger spatial control to generate backgrounds:
   1) Salient attention constraint: Adds auxiliary loss to make attention map distribution approximate the saliency distribution.
   2) Attention reduction: Reduces attention weights in user-specified regions.

Layout Generator: 
- Implements a Transformer-based sequential layout generator conditioned on backgrounds.
- Proposes iterative inference strategy to enable interactive refinement between backgrounds and layouts for more harmonious compositions.

Main Contributions:
- First attempt to establish an automatic pipeline for design template generation with comprehensive evaluation metrics.
- Constructed a dataset of 40k advertisement banners with rich design metadata.  
- Extended T2I models with saliency constraints and attention reduction for spatial control in background generation.
- Proposed iterative refinement between backgrounds and layouts for more harmonious compositions.
- Showed an application of generating presentation slides, demonstrating potential for automated design creation.
