# [Unlink to Unlearn: Simplifying Edge Unlearning in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unlink to Unlearn: Simplifying Edge Unlearning in GNNs":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) can implicitly "remember" sensitive training data, posing privacy risks. To address this, the concept of machine unlearning has emerged to enable removal of specific data from trained models.
- The paper focuses on edge unlearning in GNNs, which is important for applications like social networks where users may want to delete connections. 
- The state-of-the-art method, GNNDelete, can effectively unlearn edges but suffers from "over-forgetting", where the model inadvertently forgets too much and harms performance on retained data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes GNNDelete's loss functions and finds they are unsuitable optimization objectives, causing the over-forgetting.
- The paper then proposes a simplified method called "Unlink to Unlearn" (UtU) which solely unlinks the forgotten edges from the graph structure input to the GNN at inference time. This blocks message passing related to forgotten edges.
- UtU eliminates the need for loss functions and complex parameter optimization, reducing computations. It acts directly on the graph structure with O(1) complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies connection between GNNDelete's loss functions and over-forgetting phenomenon
- Proposes UtU, a simplified edge unlearning approach that just unlinks forget edges from graph structure input to GNN
- Experiments show UtU's performance and outputs align closely with a model retrained from scratch, upholding 97.3% of its privacy protection and 99.8% accuracy
- UtU resolves over-forgetting, unlike GNNDelete, and is highly efficient with near-zero computations
- Overall presents UtU as a lightweight yet effective practical solution for edge unlearning in GNNs
