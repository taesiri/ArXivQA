# [ANN vs SNN: A case study for Neural Decoding in Implantable   Brain-Machine Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMI) are a promising technology to help paralyzed patients by decoding their intent from neural activity. However, increasing number of recording channels poses challenges for wireless transmission due to high data rates. 
- On-sensor computing by extracting information (e.g. intention decoding) can provide maximum data compression but requires extremely efficient algorithms.

Solutions Proposed:
- Compare different neural network (NN) models - spiking neural networks (SNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), ANN with memory (ANN_3D), LSTM and streaming SNN.
- Evaluate tradeoffs between accuracy and cost where cost is memory footprint and operations (proxy for energy).
- Introduce Bessel filtering at output to add memory and smoothness to predictions.
- Compare across model complexity, training data size and test data quality.

Main Contributions:
- Bidirectional Bessel filtering boosts performance of all models with gains of 0.05, 0.04 and 0.03 in R^2 score for ANN_3d, SNN_3D and ANN respectively.
- ANN model combined with filtering achieves similar accuracy as SNN_streaming without filtering. This shows adding memory to ANN can make it as good as SNNs.
- Increasing training data helps improve R^2 by 0.03-0.04 showing models have capacity for more gains.
- Pareto front for accuracy vs cost has LSTM and streaming SNN at two extremes with intermediate points occupied by SNN_3D and ANN_3D.

In summary, the paper explores combining NNs with signal processing methods to get accurate and extremely efficient intention decoders for future wireless high-channel count BMIs. The introduced benchmarking helps guide designs requiring different cost-performance tradeoffs.
