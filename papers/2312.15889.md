# [ANN vs SNN: A case study for Neural Decoding in Implantable   Brain-Machine Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMI) are a promising technology to help paralyzed patients by decoding their intent from neural activity. However, increasing number of recording channels poses challenges for wireless transmission due to high data rates. 
- On-sensor computing by extracting information (e.g. intention decoding) can provide maximum data compression but requires extremely efficient algorithms.

Solutions Proposed:
- Compare different neural network (NN) models - spiking neural networks (SNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), ANN with memory (ANN_3D), LSTM and streaming SNN.
- Evaluate tradeoffs between accuracy and cost where cost is memory footprint and operations (proxy for energy).
- Introduce Bessel filtering at output to add memory and smoothness to predictions.
- Compare across model complexity, training data size and test data quality.

Main Contributions:
- Bidirectional Bessel filtering boosts performance of all models with gains of 0.05, 0.04 and 0.03 in R^2 score for ANN_3d, SNN_3D and ANN respectively.
- ANN model combined with filtering achieves similar accuracy as SNN_streaming without filtering. This shows adding memory to ANN can make it as good as SNNs.
- Increasing training data helps improve R^2 by 0.03-0.04 showing models have capacity for more gains.
- Pareto front for accuracy vs cost has LSTM and streaming SNN at two extremes with intermediate points occupied by SNN_3D and ANN_3D.

In summary, the paper explores combining NNs with signal processing methods to get accurate and extremely efficient intention decoders for future wireless high-channel count BMIs. The introduced benchmarking helps guide designs requiring different cost-performance tradeoffs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

This paper compares different neural network models for motor decoding in brain-machine interfaces, showing that combining traditional signal processing techniques like filtering with machine learning models delivers good performance even with simple networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It compares SNNs with ANNs augmented with memory (at hidden state using LSTM and at output using traditional Bessel filtering from signal processing) for motor decoding on a common benchmark dataset. 

2. It shows that combining NNs with traditional signal processing methods like filtering can drastically improve performance with minimal increase in compute/memory cost. Adding Bessel filtering led to accuracy improvements of 0.05, 0.04 and 0.03 in R^2 score for the ANN_3d, SNN_3D and ANN models respectively.

3. It analyzes the effect of increasing training data, showing which models have potential for further improvements. Increasing data from 50% to 80% of reaches led to R^2 improvements of 0.03-0.04 for all models.

4. It tests with better curated test data by removing outlier reaches, leading to R^2 improvements of ~0.01 across models.

5. It provides comprehensive pareto curve analysis highlighting accuracy vs compute/memory tradeoffs and where different models lie showing LSTM and SNN_streaming at two extremes while SNN_3D and ANN_3D occupy intermediate positions.

In summary, it provides extensive benchmarking and analysis to show that augmenting ANNs can make their performance comparable or better than SNNs for motor decoding. The work also culminates in new state-of-the-art results for this dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores using both traditional signal processing techniques like filters as well as neural networks for motor decoding. What is the intuition behind combining these two approaches? What are the limitations of using them independently?

2. The paper evaluates multiple neural network architectures like LSTM, ANNs, and SNNs. What are the key differences between these architectures in terms of how they process temporal information? How do these architectural differences translate to differences in accuracy and computational/memory costs?

3. The paper proposes using a Bessel filter at the output of the neural network models to smooth the predictions. What are the advantages of using a Bessel filter over other types of filters for this application? How does the order and cutoff frequency impact the accuracy versus latency tradeoff? 

4. The SNN_3D model divides the input timeframe into sub-windows and processes spikes from each sub-window using a separate weight over multiple time steps. What is the motivation behind this approach compared to the simple summation of spikes over the entire timeframe? What are its implications on accuracy and computational complexity?

5. The paper evaluates forwarding, bidirectional, and block bidirectional filtering approaches. Why is standard bidirectional filtering not suitable for real-time applications? What compromise does the block bidirectional filtering make to balance latency and accuracy?

6. The paper shows that the SNN streaming model with extremely low complexity achieves surprisingly good accuracy after the addition of filtering. What aspects of the streaming SNN architecture enable such significant complexity versus accuracy gains after filtering? What are its limitations?

7. The paper demonstrates that increasing training data from 50% to 80% of reaches improved accuracy across all models. What does this result imply about the model capacities and potential for future improvements? Are there any data augmentation strategies that can be adopted?

8. The paper shows improved accuracy from carefully curating the test data. What are some data selection and cleaning strategies that can be incorporated into the testing workflow to reflect real deployment conditions better?

9. The addition of filtering improved ANN model accuracy close to that of SNN models. Can optimizations like network quantization be applied to reduce the memory footprint gap between ANNs and SNNs further? What techniques can be incorporated to retain sparsity in SNNs after input normalization?

10. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of simple neural network models combined with filters. Would increasing model complexity significantly improve accuracy further or lead to overfitting issues? How can model complexity versus accuracy and generalizability be studied systematically?
