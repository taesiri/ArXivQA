# [APPLE: Adversarial Privacy-aware Perturbations on Latent Embedding for   Unfairness Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ensuring fairness in medical image analysis is important for health equity. However, large pre-trained models may inherit biases from the training data. 
- Re-training these models requires extensive compute resources. Hence, there is a need for methods to improve fairness of deployed models without changing model parameters.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes APPLE - Adversarial Privacy-aware Perturbations on Latent Embedding. 
- It adds a perturbation module to the latent embedding of a fixed segmentation model. The perturbation aims to hide sensitive attributes from propagating to the decoder, while preserving utility.
- APPLE employs a generator to create fair perturbations and a discriminator tries to predict sensitive attributes from them. They are trained adversarially. 

Key Contributions:
- APPLE can improve fairness of deployed medical segmentation models without re-training them. This is more practical compared to methods needing full re-training.
- Experiments on two datasets with three segmentation architectures demonstrate improved fairness in terms of maximum disparity, skewed error rate etc.
- Ablations verify the impact of loss hyperparameters on balancing utility and fairness.
- Experiments show promise for using APPLE with large pre-trained models like SAM and MedSAM to mitigate their biases without full fine-tuning.

In summary, the key novelty is being able to modify any deployed segmentation model to make it fairer by manipulating only the latent embeddings in an adversarial manner, without needing to change model parameters. Experiments prove its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called APPLE that can improve the fairness of deployed medical image segmentors by perturbing their latent embeddings using a GAN, without needing to modify the segmentors' parameters or architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are fourfold:

1. It implements the first attempt at unfairness mitigation in medical segmentation where the parameters of the base model are fixed. This is more practical for medical applications where retraining large models is difficult. 

2. It proposes APPLE, an algorithm that improves model fairness by perturbing the latent embedding of a pre-trained segmentor using a GAN. By adjusting the loss weight β, APPLE can control the extent of unfairness mitigation.

3. Extensive experiments on two medical segmentation datasets prove that APPLE can effectively improve the fairness of deployed segmentors.

4. Experiments integrating APPLE with large-scale foundation segmentation models like SAM and MedSAM demonstrate its promising utility for unfairness mitigation in those models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing APPLE as a practical and effective method to mitigate unfairness in fixed pre-trained medical segmentors and large foundation models, without needing to retrain them.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Fairness - The paper focuses on ensuring fairness and mitigating unfairness in medical image segmentation models.

- Segmentation - The paper addresses unfairness issues specifically in segmentation tasks/models.

- Feature perturbation - The proposed APPLE method works by perturbing the latent features of a segmentation model to hide sensitive attributes. 

- Generative adversarial networks (GAN) - APPLE uses a GAN-based approach, with a generator and discriminator, to learn fair perturbations.

- Model agnostic - APPLE is described as a model-agnostic algorithm that can work with different segmentation architectures.

- Foundation models - Experiments show APPLE can mitigate unfairness when integrated into foundation segmentation models like SAM and MedSAM.

- Health equity - Improving fairness is connected to goals of preserving privacy and promoting health equity.

So in summary, key terms revolve around fairness, segmentation, perturbation, GANs, model agnosticism, foundation models, and health equity. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
