# [Rendering Humans from Object-Occluded Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04622)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we render high-quality 3D humans from monocular videos that contain occlusions from real-world objects like obstacles?

The key challenges and hypotheses appear to be:

- Existing neural human rendering methods like Neural Body and HumanNeRF fail under occlusions due to relying on point-based rendering and not properly incorporating priors. 

- A surface-based rendering strategy along with visibility and geometry priors can help address these issues and achieve better rendering quality of humans from object-occluded monocular videos.

So in summary, the central research question seems to be focused on developing a method to render high-quality 3D humans from monocular videos containing occlusions, with the key hypothesis being that a surface-based rendering approach and appropriate priors can enable this capability. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a novel method called OccNeRF for rendering humans from object-occluded monocular videos. This is the first work to study dynamic human rendering under real-world occlusions. 

2. The paper presents two key technical innovations to enable high-quality rendering under occlusions:

- Formulating visibility frequencies as attention maps to focus rendering on commonly visible areas.  

3. The proposed OccNeRF method is evaluated on both simulated and real occlusions and shown to significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art like HumanNeRF. This establishes the first strong baseline for the task of rendering occluded humans from monocular video.

4. Through ablations, the paper demonstrates the importance of the surface rendering and visibility attention components for achieving good performance.

In summary, the core contribution is proposing a novel neural rendering approach OccNeRF that can effectively handle occlusions and render high-quality humans from monocular videos. This is enabled by technical innovations around surface-based rendering and visibility attention. The strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of OccNeRF as the new state-of-the-art approach for this challenging problem.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a neural rendering method called OccNeRF that achieves better rendering of humans in severely occluded scenes by using surface-based rendering with geometry and visibility priors.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on rendering humans from monocular videos:

- This paper focuses specifically on handling occlusions and rendering humans from object-occluded videos. Most prior work assumes a clean view of the human without occlusions. This paper is one of the first to tackle the problem of occlusions.

- The proposed method OccNeRF uses a surface-based rendering approach rather than standard point-based rendering used in most neural radiance field methods. This allows better handling of occlusions by considering a region around each point rather than just a single point input.

- The paper incorporates geometry and visibility priors to help fill in occluded regions. This includes using an SMPL model to parameterize the surface and formulating visibility as attention maps. Most methods do not leverage such explicit priors.

- For evaluation, the paper tests on both simulated and real occlusion datasets. Comparisons to prior arts like HumanNeRF show significant improvements in rendering quality, especially in occluded regions. This is the first work to benchmark on real occluded human videos.

- The approach has some limitations like slower rendering speed and inability to fully inpaint unseen regions. But overall it sets a new state-of-the-art for handling occlusions in human rendering from monocular video.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions by tackling the challenging problem of occlusions in human rendering where most prior work fails. The novel components like surface-based rendering and visibility attention offer advantages over previous point-based methods. The results are state-of-the-art despite limitations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better geometry priors for representing the human body shape and surface. The authors mention that using more accurate body models like the ones from SelfRecon could further improve their surface-based rendering approach.

- Exploring cross-scene training strategies to overcome limitations in inpainting occluded areas that are never observed in the training video. The authors suggest using methods like GP-NeRF that can leverage information across different scenes.

- Improving training and inference speed. The hash grid encoding helps accelerate training convergence but slows down rendering speed. Faster encoding strategies could help optimize both speed and quality. 

- Generalizing the approach to handle dynamic scenes with moving cameras and backgrounds. The current method focuses on static backgrounds and fixed camera positions. Extending it to more complex dynamic scenes is an important direction.

- Combining with human pose estimation and tracking methods to handle cases where priors like body poses and SMPL parameters are inaccurate or not available. Making the method more robust to imperfect inputs could improve applicability.

- Extending the surface-based rendering idea to general objects beyond just humans. The core ideas could potentially generalize to improve rendering of other objects under occlusions.

In summary, the key future directions are improving the geometry priors, enabling cross-scene training, speeding up training/inference, handling dynamic scenes, improving robustness to imperfect inputs, and generalizing beyond humans. Overall, enhancing the method's quality, flexibility and applicability in real-world conditions appears to be the central focus.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called OccNeRF for rendering 3D humans from monocular videos that contain occlusions caused by obstacles blocking parts of the human body. Most prior work assumes a clear view of the full body, but real-world scenes often have occlusions. The key ideas are 1) using surface-based rendering that aggregates information across the human surface rather than just single points to improve robustness to occlusions, 2) formulating visibility frequencies as attention maps to focus more on visible areas, and 3) adding a completeness loss to encourage filling in occluded regions properly. Experiments show the method outperforms previous state-of-the-art on simulated and real occlusions, producing more complete renderings with fewer artifacts. The work provides a new strong baseline for the challenging problem of rendering humans from object-occluded monocular video.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents OccNeRF, a novel neural rendering method to achieve high-quality rendering of humans in severely occluded scenes from monocular videos. Most prior work assumes clear views of the entire human body without any occlusions. However, real-world environments often contain obstacles that block the camera view and contaminate the captured videos. Directly applying previous methods leads to poor performance. The authors identify two major drawbacks of existing approaches: (1) reliance on point-to-point mapping during rendering fails to model local geometry and leads to artifacts in occluded areas, and (2) lack of incorporating proper priors in the rendering process. 

To address the above issues, the authors propose three main contributions: (1) A surface-based rendering strategy that conditions each sample's radiance prediction on a surface region rather than a single point. This better models local geometry under occlusions. (2) Converting the visibility frequency of different body parts into attention maps to guide the aggregation of surface regions. This incorporates visibility priors into the rendering process. (3) A novel loss function that encourages high density values inside the 3D human body to maintain geometry completeness. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real-world occlusion scenarios. The proposed OccNeRF establishes the new benchmark for the task of rendering occluded humans from monocular videos.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents OccNeRF, a novel neural rendering method to achieve high-quality rendering of humans in severely occluded scenes from monocular videos. OccNeRF proposes a surface-based rendering strategy that determines the radiance of each ray sample by conditioning it on a wide region of the human body's surface, which is discretely parameterized using the vertices of a precomputed SMPL mesh. It also computes attention scores for the SMPL vertices based on their visibility frequency in the training frames, allowing more attention on frequently visible areas to improve rendering quality. Additionally, a completeness loss is designed to encourage outputting high density values within the human body. Through the proposed surface-based rendering, visibility attention, and completeness loss, OccNeRF is able to accurately render humans even with severe occlusions in the training video.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of rendering 3D humans from monocular videos in real-world scenarios where the human may be partially occluded by obstacles in the scene. Specifically, it aims to tackle two key challenges:

1. Existing rendering methods rely on point-to-point mapping, which can lead to dramatic disparities between visible and occluded areas when training on partially occluded data. 

2. Naive direct regression approaches do not incorporate any feasibility constraints or prior information to handle occluded regions.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new method called OccNeRF that integrates geometry and visibility priors into the rendering process through surface-based rendering, visibility attention, and a novel loss function. The goal is to achieve high-quality rendering of humans from monocular video even with severe occlusions present.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively render 3D humans from monocular video in real-world settings with occlusions, which existing methods fail to handle properly. The paper introduces a new approach called OccNeRF to incorporate useful priors and constraints that allow rendering occluded regions in a feasible way.
