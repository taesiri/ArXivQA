# [Rendering Humans from Object-Occluded Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04622)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we render high-quality 3D humans from monocular videos that contain occlusions from real-world objects like obstacles?The key challenges and hypotheses appear to be:- Existing neural human rendering methods like Neural Body and HumanNeRF fail under occlusions due to relying on point-based rendering and not properly incorporating priors. - A surface-based rendering strategy along with visibility and geometry priors can help address these issues and achieve better rendering quality of humans from object-occluded monocular videos.So in summary, the central research question seems to be focused on developing a method to render high-quality 3D humans from monocular videos containing occlusions, with the key hypothesis being that a surface-based rendering approach and appropriate priors can enable this capability. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose a novel method called OccNeRF for rendering humans from object-occluded monocular videos. This is the first work to study dynamic human rendering under real-world occlusions. 2. The paper presents two key technical innovations to enable high-quality rendering under occlusions:- Surface-based rendering that conditions the radiance prediction on surface segments rather than individual points. This provides better generalization under occlusion.- Formulating visibility frequencies as attention maps to focus rendering on commonly visible areas.  3. The proposed OccNeRF method is evaluated on both simulated and real occlusions and shown to significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art like HumanNeRF. This establishes the first strong baseline for the task of rendering occluded humans from monocular video.4. Through ablations, the paper demonstrates the importance of the surface rendering and visibility attention components for achieving good performance.In summary, the core contribution is proposing a novel neural rendering approach OccNeRF that can effectively handle occlusions and render high-quality humans from monocular videos. This is enabled by technical innovations around surface-based rendering and visibility attention. The strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of OccNeRF as the new state-of-the-art approach for this challenging problem.
