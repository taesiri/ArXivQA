# [Learning Pixel-wise Continuous Depth Representation via Clustering for   Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing classification-based depth completion methods rely on pixel-shared and discrete depth categories to represent depth values. However, this representation fails to capture the continuous distribution of real-world depth values across different scenes, leading to depth smearing around object boundaries. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel clustering-based framework called CluDe that focuses on learning pixel-wise continuous depth representation to address the problem. The key idea is to iteratively convert an initial discrete depth representation to a continuous counterpart that aligns with the scene's actual depth distribution. 

Specifically, CluDe first uses depth value clustering to learn a set of depth centers that represent the depth distribution better than predefined categories. Although still discrete, these centers are aligned with the distribution. Next, CluDe estimates per-pixel offsets to dynamically adjust the centers along the depth axis, converting them into a pixel-wise continuous representation.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to tackle depth completion from a clustering view by learning pixel-wise continuous depth representations 
- Implicitly learns valid depth centers from real distribution using depth guidance signals 
- Introduces hierarchical translation module to iteratively transform discrete centers into per-pixel continuous representations
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance among classification-based methods on KITTI and VOID datasets
- Alleviates depth smearing around boundaries by capturing scene-specific depth distributions

In summary, the proposed CluDe framework innovatively addresses limitations of classification-based depth completion by learning adaptive pixel-wise depth representations, leading to improved completion quality.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel clustering-based depth completion framework called CluDe that focuses on learning pixel-wise continuous depth representation to address the issue of depth smearing in boundary regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a novel clustering-based framework called CluDe for depth completion. To the best of their knowledge, this is the first work to approach depth completion from a clustering perspective. 

2. CluDe focuses on learning pixel-wise and continuous depth representation to capture the real depth distribution and address depth smearing issues. It first learns a set of depth centers through clustering to represent the depth distribution. Then it estimates offsets to adjust these centers into a pixel-wise continuous representation.

3. Extensive experiments show that CluDe effectively reduces depth smearing around object boundaries by utilizing the pixel-wise continuous representation. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance among classification-based depth completion methods on the KITTI and VOID datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a new clustering-based depth completion framework CluDe, which can learn pixel-wise continuous depth representation to improve completion quality and reduce depth smearing. The effectiveness of CluDe is demonstrated through extensive experiments.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing a clustering-based framework for depth completion instead of using the traditional classification-based framework?

2. How does the clustering transformer support depth clustering and learn the depth centers from the dataset? What is the role of self-attention and cross-attention here?

4. What is the purpose of using the depth cue calculated from the sparse depth map and predicted depth? How does it guide the offset estimation?

5. What are the limitations of using max/min pooling on multi-scale sparse depth maps? Why is an additional filtering method still required at the original scale?

6. How does the approximate Laplace distribution help in transforming the sparse depth values into logistic scores? What information does it provide?

7. How does the implicit learning of depth centers take place in the absence of direct supervision? Explain the role of depth guidance here.

8. What are the comparative advantages and limitations of the clustering framework over the classification framework for depth completion?

9. Why does the method face challenges in effectively learning representations for depth values in the tail categories of the distribution?

10. How can the idea of clustering-based representation be extended to other dense prediction tasks like optical flow, scene flow etc.? What components would need to change?
