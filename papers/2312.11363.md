 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Online Vertical Federated Learning for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing":

Problem: 
The paper addresses two key challenges in using vertical federated learning (VFL) for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in wireless networks:
1) Existing VFL solutions rely on static datasets and do not work well with streaming data generated by mobile secondary users (SUs).
2) The learning objectives shift over time due to mobility of SUs and evolving wireless environments.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new algorithm called Online Vertical Federated Learning (OVFL) to address these challenges. The key aspects of OVFL are:

1) Processes streaming data from SUs instead of static batches.
2) Adapts model incrementally via online learning to handle shifting objectives.  
3) Uses quantization of embeddings before transmission to improve communication efficiency.

4) Performs local model updates at both SUs and fusion center in each global round based on new streaming data.

Theoretical Contributions:
1) Provides regret analysis of OVFL and shows it achieves sub-linear regret bound O(√T) over T rounds without quantization.

2) Analysis shows that with proper decay of quantization levels over time, OVFL can still achieve sub-linear regret bound O(√T) despite quantization errors.

Experimental Contributions: 
1) Evaluates OVFL for CSS using simulations and shows superior performance over benchmarks.

2) Studies impact of parameters like local epochs, mobility rate, quantization levels, number of primary and secondary users etc. on the model performance.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in proposing an online VFL algorithm for handling streaming data and shifting objectives, along with theoretical and empirical evidence of its practical utility.
