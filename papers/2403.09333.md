# [Griffon v2: Advancing Multimodal Perception with High-Resolution Scaling   and Visual-Language Co-Referring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current large vision language models (LVLMs) are limited in surpassing task-specific expert models due to constraints on image resolution, which restricts their ability to capture nuanced visual details. This affects performance on complex, dense scenarios requiring fine-grained perception.

- Existing methods that divide images into patches lose contextual information. Progressive scaling methods are computationally expensive. 

- Singular visual or textual referring modes have limitations - visual prompts lack conversational ability while textual prompts can be ambiguous.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Griffon v2, a high-resolution LVLM supporting flexible visual-language co-referring to refer to objects.

- Design a lightweight down-sampling projector to compress high-res visual features into tokens for the language model, avoiding image division. Preserves contexts and details.

- Enable referring objects via visual prompts (cropped screenshot), texts (descriptions & coordinates) and both. Mitigates limitations of singular modes.

- Use a 3-stage training pipeline over 12M multi-task data and 900K instruction data.

Main Contributions:
- High-res structure supporting >1K resolution input without division, via projector. More accurate perception.

- Visual-language co-referring structure for flexible reference modes. Mitigates limitations of singular modes.

- Surpasses state-of-the-art in REC, phrase grounding and REG tasks. Outperforms experts in detection & counting.

- Establishes strong foundation for LVLMs with enhanced fine-grained perception and localization abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Griffon v2 is a high-resolution multimodal model with visual-language co-referring capabilities that achieves state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension, generation, phrase grounding, and surpasses expert models in object detection and counting tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a high-resolution multimodal perception model called Griffon v2 that supports image resolutions up to 1K without using image division. This is achieved through a lightweight down-sampling projector design.

2. Introducing a visual-language co-referring paradigm that allows referring to objects through local cropped images, texts, and coordinates. This provides more flexible and accurate object referring capabilities. 

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on tasks like Referring Expression Comprehension, Referring Expression Generation, phrase grounding. Also showing better performance than specialist models on object detection and counting tasks.

4. Releasing large-scale datasets containing 12M instances for pre-training and 900K instructions for fine-tuning to facilitate research in this direction.

In summary, the main highlights are proposing a high-resolution model design, flexible visual-textual referring, strong empirical results surpassing specialist models, and releasing useful datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a high-resolution multimodal model called Griffon v2. What is the key motivation behind developing a high-resolution model compared to existing lower resolution models? What specific limitations does it aim to address?

2. The paper introduces a down-sampling projector to handle high-resolution images. How does this projector work? What are the advantages compared to simply dividing the image into smaller patches?

3. The paper proposes a visual-language co-referring structure. What are the different modes of referring supported and how do they work? How does this overcome limitations of using just visual or just textual referring?  

4. The paper adopts a 3-stage training pipeline. Can you explain what happens in each training stage and what is the purpose of that stage? Why is a multi-stage approach used?

5. For the high-resolution visual encoder, the paper experiments with different pretrained models like EVA2-CLIP and SAM-CLIP. What differences were observed? Why does EVA2-CLIP perform the best?

6. The paper compares the downsampling projector with a resampler used in prior work. What differences in performance and computational requirements were observed? Why is the projector more suitable?

7. What was the motivation behind using an unfrozen visual encoder? What improvements were obtained by unfreezing the encoder compared to keeping it frozen?

8. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets like RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ etc. Analyze the results and explain why the proposed model outperforms prior state-of-the-art models. 

9. For complex detection and counting tasks, the paper shows that Griffon v2 can surpass expert models designed specifically for those tasks. What capabilities enable this level of performance from a general multimodal model?

10. The model supports flexible visual and textual referring during evaluation. Can you discuss some real-world applications that could benefit from this capability? What new user interaction modes does it enable?
