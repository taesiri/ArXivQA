# [PreRoutGNN for Timing Prediction with Order Preserving Partition: Global   Circuit Pre-training, Local Delay Learning and Attentional Cell Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00012)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Timing analysis is critical to evaluate circuit design quality but accurate timing information is only available after time-consuming routing stage. 
- Machine learning has been applied for pre-routing timing prediction but suffers from two key issues:
  1) Signal decay and error accumulation due to long timing paths in large circuits
  2) High peak GPU memory cost during training that makes training intractable

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage approach
  1) Global circuit pre-training: Train an autoencoder to extract global graph embeddings that capture global circuit topology
  2) Residual local learning GNN: 
     - Novel message passing scheme that explicitly models local signal delays along timing paths  
     - Attention mechanism to model cell's timing behavior 
     - Order preserving graph partitioning to reduce memory while maintaining topological dependencies

Key Contributions:  
- First work to introduce global circuit pre-training for timing prediction. Captures global topology to address signal decay issue
- New residual message passing scheme for local signal delay modeling in long timing paths  
- Attention mechanism for cell modeling inspired by cell delay model lookup tables
- Order preserving graph partitioning algorithm to handle large circuits  
- State-of-the-art results on 21 real-world circuits - Achieves slack prediction $R^2$ of 0.93, significantly improving over previous SOTA of 0.59

In summary, the paper proposes both global pre-training and specialized GNN design to address key challenges in pre-routing timing prediction for integrated circuit design. The global-local approach combined with efficient partitioning enables strong performance on practical large-scale circuit benchmarks.
