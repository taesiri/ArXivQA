# [MYTE: Morphology-Driven Byte Encoding for Better and Fairer Multilingual   Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10691)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing text encoding methods like UTF-8 exhibit bias towards high-resource languages, leading to over-segmentation of texts from underrepresented languages into long sequences of meaningless units. This hurts model performance and inference cost.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new byte encoding scheme called MYTE (Morphology-driven Byte Encoding) that is based on morphological segmentation using an unsupervised algorithm. 
- Assign byte codes to morphemes instead of characters since morphemes are more balanced units across languages. This leads to shorter, more equitable encodings.

Key Contributions:
- Propose a novel morphology-based paradigm for byte-level text encoding to improve multilingual language modeling.
- Empirically show MYTE produces more equitable text encodings across 99 diverse languages - sequence lengths are decreased for all languages, especially non-European ones.
- Compression rate is 70% for some languages, improving efficiency.
- Apply MYTE to train MyT5 models which outperform ByT5 models on perplexity across almost all languages. Closes the LM performance gap between high and low resource languages.
- MyT5 also has faster inference than ByT5 while achieving competitive performance on downstream tasks like QA, NER and MT.
- Overall, MYTE encoding bridges disparities in representing texts across languages, benefiting low-resource ones the most.
