# [MARS: Model-agnostic Biased Object Removal without Additional   Supervision for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It aims to address the "biased problem" in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), where models tend to falsely activate class-related backgrounds (e.g. detecting boats with sea or trains with railroad). This is a major limitation in current WSSS methods. 

- The paper proposes a new approach called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal without additional Supervision) to eliminate biased objects in WSSS predictions without needing additional datasets or manual supervision.

- MARS utilizes unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) methods to extract semantically consistent features. It makes two key observations:
   - USS-based clustering can separate biased and target objects in WSSS predictions.
   - A new USS-based distance metric can identify biased objects against target objects.

- Using these USS features, MARS removes biased objects by matching them to background regions of other images in the dataset. It also complements the debiased labels using model predictions to avoid increasing false negatives.

- Experiments show MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. It narrows the gap with fully-supervised methods by 53% and consistently improves various WSSS methods.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that exploiting semantic consistency from USS can help automatically remove biased objects in WSSS without needing additional supervision or datasets. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARS approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper proposes a new method called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal without additional Supervision) to address the "biased problem" in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). 

2. The key idea is to leverage unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) to automatically remove biased objects from the pseudo labels generated by WSSS, without needing any extra supervision or datasets.

3. Specifically, MARS has two main technical contributions:

(a) It introduces a method to select "debiased centroids" from the USS embeddings to represent target objects and filter out biased objects. This is done by comparing distances between foreground centroids and global background centroids.

(b) It generates "debiased labels" by computing similarity between the debiased centroids and pixel-wise USS embeddings. It then complements these debiased labels using predictions from the model during training.

4. Experiments show that MARS achieves new state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012 (77.7% mIoU) and MS COCO 2014 (49.4% mIoU) among prior WSSS methods.

5. MARS demonstrates consistent improvements over several existing WSSS techniques, highlighting its model-agnostic nature.

In summary, the key novelty is using USS in a model-agnostic way to automatically remove biased objects from WSSS pseudo labels, eliminating the need for extra supervision or datasets that prior biased-object removal techniques require. The proposed techniques for debiased centroid selection and label generation are simple yet effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel model-agnostic approach called MARS that leverages semantic feature consistency from unsupervised segmentation to automatically remove biased objects in weakly supervised segmentation without requiring additional datasets or manual identification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in weakly supervised semantic segmentation:

- It focuses on addressing the "biased problem" in WSSS. Many WSSS methods struggle with activating class-related backgrounds (e.g. trains on railroads, boats on water), leading to false positives. This paper analyzes the extent of this problem and proposes a novel approach to mitigate it.

- The proposed method, MARS, leverages unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) to help identify and eliminate biased objects in the WSSS pipeline. This is a unique approach compared to other WSSS methods, and the first to explore combining USS and WSSS for debiasing. 

- MARS does not require any additional supervision (e.g. saliency maps, human-labeled datasets of biased objects) or modification of the WSSS method. It works in a model-agnostic way by simply utilizing the output of existing USS and WSSS models. This makes it more flexible and practical compared to prior works.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. MARS significantly closes the gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised methods, outperforming prior WSSS techniques by 3-6% mIoU.

- The authors validate MARS on more complex and larger-scale datasets like COCO, whereas most prior biased object removal techniques only show results on simpler datasets like PASCAL VOC.

In summary, this paper provides valuable new analysis and insights into the biased object problem in WSSS, and proposes a flexible, model-agnostic solution that pushes state-of-the-art performance. The model-agnostic nature and lack of extra supervision requirements are notable advantages compared to related techniques.
