# [MARS: Model-agnostic Biased Object Removal without Additional   Supervision for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It aims to address the "biased problem" in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), where models tend to falsely activate class-related backgrounds (e.g. detecting boats with sea or trains with railroad). This is a major limitation in current WSSS methods. - The paper proposes a new approach called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal without additional Supervision) to eliminate biased objects in WSSS predictions without needing additional datasets or manual supervision.- MARS utilizes unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) methods to extract semantically consistent features. It makes two key observations:   - USS-based clustering can separate biased and target objects in WSSS predictions.   - A new USS-based distance metric can identify biased objects against target objects.- Using these USS features, MARS removes biased objects by matching them to background regions of other images in the dataset. It also complements the debiased labels using model predictions to avoid increasing false negatives.- Experiments show MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. It narrows the gap with fully-supervised methods by 53% and consistently improves various WSSS methods.In summary, the main hypothesis is that exploiting semantic consistency from USS can help automatically remove biased objects in WSSS without needing additional supervision or datasets. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARS approach.
