# [Reducing self-supervised learning complexity improves weakly-supervised   classification performance in computational pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for training foundation models in computational pathology use very large datasets and models, requiring massive computational resources. This limits access to only a few institutions with abundant resources. 
- There is a need to explore ways to reduce the complexity of SSL to make it more accessible for institutions with limited resources.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors perform a comprehensive ablation study analyzing how modifications to the SSL data volume, model architecture, and contrastive learning algorithm impact downstream classification performance and computational requirements.
- They train SSL models on a public breast cancer cohort and validate on mutation prediction and metastasis detection tasks using two external cohorts in a weakly supervised manner.

Main Contributions:
- Show that reducing SSL training data by 50% does not affect downstream performance. Enables cutting compute resources in half.
- Demonstrate that removing later stages of the SSL model architecture can improve downstream performance while reducing parameters. 
- Propose negative sampling and dynamic sampling methods that improve over state-of-the-art semantically relevant contrastive learning techniques.
- Overall, adaptations proposed enable conducting SSL for computational pathology effectively using consumer-grade hardware, making it accessible to more institutions globally.

In summary, the authors provide methodological insights that could enable more groups to leverage SSL techniques for computational pathology, overcoming limitations of computational resources. The techniques help scale SSL while even improving effectiveness on clinical prediction tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper explores modifications to contrastive self-supervised learning approaches for computational pathology, including reducing training data volume, modifying model architecture, and adapting the loss function, which enable improved efficiency and downstream performance while lowering computational requirements to facilitate broader access to these methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive ablation study that analyzes methods to reduce the complexity of contrastive self-supervised learning in computational pathology, in order to enable its use in resource-constrained environments. Specifically, the paper:

- Shows that a 50% reduction in self-supervised training data does not affect downstream classification performance. This allows cutting computational costs in half.

- Demonstrates that removing the last stage of the Swin Transformer encoder for feature extraction can improve performance on some downstream tasks while also reducing computational complexity. 

- Proposes new semantically relevant sampling methods (negative sampling and dynamic sampling) that improve over prior work in histopathology.

- More broadly, the experiments and analysis provide a framework to benchmark modifications to contrastive self-supervised learning in pathology, in order to make it accessible to more institutions without massive computational resources.

The main conclusion is that with careful tuning, the complexity of self-supervised learning for computational pathology can be reduced substantially without sacrificing downstream performance. This enables more groups to leverage these methods and contribute to advancements in the field.
