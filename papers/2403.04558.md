# [Reducing self-supervised learning complexity improves weakly-supervised   classification performance in computational pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for training foundation models in computational pathology use very large datasets and models, requiring massive computational resources. This limits access to only a few institutions with abundant resources. 
- There is a need to explore ways to reduce the complexity of SSL to make it more accessible for institutions with limited resources.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors perform a comprehensive ablation study analyzing how modifications to the SSL data volume, model architecture, and contrastive learning algorithm impact downstream classification performance and computational requirements.
- They train SSL models on a public breast cancer cohort and validate on mutation prediction and metastasis detection tasks using two external cohorts in a weakly supervised manner.

Main Contributions:
- Show that reducing SSL training data by 50% does not affect downstream performance. Enables cutting compute resources in half.
- Demonstrate that removing later stages of the SSL model architecture can improve downstream performance while reducing parameters. 
- Propose negative sampling and dynamic sampling methods that improve over state-of-the-art semantically relevant contrastive learning techniques.
- Overall, adaptations proposed enable conducting SSL for computational pathology effectively using consumer-grade hardware, making it accessible to more institutions globally.

In summary, the authors provide methodological insights that could enable more groups to leverage SSL techniques for computational pathology, overcoming limitations of computational resources. The techniques help scale SSL while even improving effectiveness on clinical prediction tasks.
