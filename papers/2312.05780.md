# [PULSAR: Graph based Positive Unlabeled Learning with Multi Stream   Adaptive Convolutions for Parkinson's Disease Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and coordination. Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve quality of life for patients.  
- However, access to clinical diagnosis is limited, especially in low and middle income countries. There is a need for automated screening tools to make PD diagnosis more accessible.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents PULSAR, a novel method to screen for PD from videos of the finger-tapping task. 
- It uses an adaptive graph convolutional neural network to model the inherent graph structure of the hand and finger joints spatially, and leverage features like bone vectors, velocity and acceleration temporally.
- It frames the problem as positive unlabeled (PU) learning to overcome the issue of unreliable negative labels in the dataset.

Data:
- Videos of the finger-tapping task recorded from 382 participants, with 183 self-reporting as having PD.
- The training set had 200 participants, test set had 182 participants, disjoint from training set.

Key Results:
- PULSAR achieved 80.95% validation accuracy and 71.29% (Â±2.49%) test accuracy over multiple trials, demonstrating efficacy of the proposed techniques.
- It outperformed baseline models significantly, showing benefits of:
   - Multi-stream features like bone, velocity and acceleration
   - Adaptive graph convolutions
   - PU learning

Main Contributions:
- A multi-stream adaptive graph convolution model for PD screening from finger-tapping videos, using limited training data
- Introduction of PU learning for this problem to overcome unreliable negative labels
- Promising performance showing potential to make PD screening more accessible through a webcam based test  

The paper demonstrates how advanced deep learning and modeling techniques can facilitate accessible PD screening with limited labeled training data.
