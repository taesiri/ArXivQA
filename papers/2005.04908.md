# [Local Self-Attention over Long Text for Efficient Document Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04908)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

RQ1: How does the proposed TKL model compare to the TK model and other state-of-the-art retrieval methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency? 

RQ2: Does retrieval quality improve when TKL considers longer portions of documents compared to just the first 200 words?

RQ3: Is TKL more likely to retrieve longer documents compared to TK?

RQ4: What is the effect of using a learned saturation function in TKL compared to fixed saturation functions?

RQ5: How often does TKL attend to different parts of the document versus just focusing on the beginning?

The key ideas explored are using local self-attention over document windows rather than full self-attention, a learned saturation function, and a two-stage pooling strategy to identify important regions. The central hypothesis seems to be that these modifications will allow efficiently eliciting relevance from long documents while avoiding bias against longer documents. The experiments aim to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of TKL versus baselines, and analyze the model's behavior.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a local self-attention mechanism for Transformer models that considers a moving window over document terms. Each term only attends to other terms in the same window, reducing compute and memory costs compared to full attention.

- A two-stage pooling strategy to identify important regions in documents - first local aggregation within windows using a learned saturation function, then global selection of top distinct regions. 

- Incorporating these ideas into a Transformer-Kernel pooling model (TKL) that can handle long documents (thousands of tokens) more efficiently and effectively.

- Experiments on TREC document ranking datasets showing TKL improves over prior Transformer-Kernel model, retrieves longer documents better, and takes advantage of longer input document lengths.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be more efficient Transformer architectures for neural document ranking that can leverage long document text through local attention and multi-stage pooling. This allows the model to avoid biases against long documents faced by prior work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Transformer-Kernel model called TKL for efficient document retrieval that uses local attention within sliding windows over long documents and a learned saturation function with two-stage pooling to identify and aggregate evidence from the most relevant regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural ranking models for document retrieval:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a local self-attention mechanism and two-staged aggregation for the Transformer-Kernel (TK) pooling architecture to enable effective ranking of long documents. This builds on prior work on TK models such as Hofst√§tter et al. 2020, but makes key innovations to handle long text.

- The paper compares against several state-of-the-art neural ranking baselines on the TREC Deep Learning 2019 document ranking dataset. The results show that the proposed TKL model outperforms prior TK models and other neural baselines, and achieves effectiveness comparable to BERT reranking models while being more efficient.

- The idea of assessing document relevance based on key relevant passages/segments has been explored before in classical IR works like Salton et al. 1993. This paper continues that line of work using neural models. 

- The local self-attention idea is related to efficient Transformer techniques in models like Reformer (Kitaev et al. 2020), but this paper specifically targets document ranking. The two-stage aggregation strategy is a novel technique proposed in this paper.

- Unlike MacAvaney et al. 2019 and Yan et al. 2020 which rely on passage-level scores, the TKL model is trained end-to-end with document-level supervision only.

- The analysis of the model's behavior provides insights into the benefits of modeling longer text and the model's ability to identify relevant regions throughout a document. This helps explain the improvements over baseline TK.

In summary, this paper makes nice contributions in adapting Transformer-Kernel models to handle long text for document ranking, with both empirical improvements and useful analysis. The innovations over prior work like local attention and two-stage aggregation seem meaningful for this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different architectures for efficient attention over long documents, such as sparse attention and dilated convolutions. The authors mention these techniques as promising ways to reduce the computational complexity of attention.

- Incorporating additional document structure into the model, such as section headings, lists, etc. The authors suggest that explicitly modeling document structure could help identify key relevant regions.

- Evaluation on a wider range of document retrieval tasks and datasets. The authors mostly evaluated on news articles and web documents, so testing on other genres could be useful.

- Analysis of the model's behavior and attention patterns to better understand what it learns. The authors suggest further analysis like visualizations could provide insights.

- Combining query-independent document representations with query-specific modeling. The authors suggest incorporating universal document embeddings pretrained on unlabeled data.

- Exploring different region scoring strategies besides selecting top maxima regions. The authors propose ideas like clustering windows or learning to combine all regions.

- Training objectives beyond pairwise ranking loss for document ranking. The authors suggest contrastive, listwise, and other losses could help further.

So in summary, the main directions seem to be improving efficiency, incorporating document structure, more rigorous evaluation, model analysis, and enhanced training objectives. The authors provide a good overview of promising ways to build on this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes modifications to the Transformer-Kernel pooling model for efficient and effective document retrieval. The modifications include using local self-attention within fixed windows over the document to reduce compute costs compared to full attention, and employing a learned saturation function and two-stage pooling strategy to identify key relevant regions in a document. The proposed TKL model is benchmarked on the TREC 2019 Deep Learning document ranking task. The results show significant improvements over the baseline TK model in retrieval quality, increased retrieval of longer documents, and only a moderate increase in compute costs. The local attention and pooling allow TKL to consider longer portions of documents (thousands of terms) compared to models that use just the first 200 terms. Analysis also reveals TKL learns to leverage signals throughout the full document.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modified Transformer-Kernel pooling model called TKL for efficient and effective document retrieval. The key modifications are: 1) Using local self-attention within moving windows over the document to reduce compute and memory costs compared to attending over the full document. 2) Employing a novel two-stage aggregation strategy involving a learned saturation function to identify the most relevant regions within a document and combining signals from these regions. 

The authors evaluate TKL on the document ranking task from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning track. The results show that TKL achieves significant improvements over the baseline Transformer-Kernel model in terms of retrieval quality while also being more likely to retrieve longer relevant documents. The local attention and two-stage aggregation allow TKL to take advantage of larger portions of document text than the baseline. Overall, the proposed TKL modifications enable efficient relevance matching over thousands of document tokens for improved document retrieval compared to truncation-based approaches.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a modified Transformer-Kernel pooling model called TKL for efficiently ranking long documents. TKL uses local self-attention within fixed-size moving windows over the document to reduce the prohibitively high compute and memory cost of full self-attention. It also employs a novel two-stage aggregation strategy - first a learned saturation function aggregates signals within each window, then the top t distinct important regions are selected globally and their signals aggregated. This allows TKL to effectively leverage signals from different parts of long documents. Experiments on the TREC Deep Learning document ranking task show TKL achieves significantly better retrieval quality than the baseline TK model and is more likely to retrieve longer relevant documents. The local attention and two-stage aggregation make TKL efficient for handling thousands of document terms.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of applying Transformer models to full document ranking, which can be prohibitively expensive in terms of compute and memory requirements due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. 

Specifically, it aims to answer the following key questions:

1) How does the proposed TKL model compare to previous methods like TK and other state-of-the-art retrieval models?

2) Does retrieval quality improve when TKL considers longer portions of documents compared to just the first 200 words? 

3) Is TKL more likely to retrieve longer documents compared to TK?

4) What is the effect of the learned saturation function proposed in TKL?

5) How often does TKL attend to different parts of the document compared to just focusing on the beginning?

To summarize, the main problem is applying Transformer models efficiently to full document ranking while avoiding bias against longer documents, and the questions aim to evaluate the proposed TKL model in terms of effectiveness, length bias, and interpretation.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes modifications to the Transformer-Kernel (TK) pooling model to enable efficient and effective relevance matching between long text documents and queries. The authors introduce local self-attention to reduce the quadratic computation cost of standard self-attention when applied to long sequences. Their model, TKL, processes the document in overlapping fixed-size windows, allowing each term to only attend to other terms in the same window. They also propose learned saturation within each window and aggregation of evidence from distinct important regions of the document. Experiments on TREC document ranking datasets show that TKL achieves significant improvements over TK and is comparable to BERT-based models while operating on much longer text at lower computational cost. TKL is more likely to retrieve longer relevant documents compared to TK. The local attention and two-stage aggregation allow TKL to elicit signals from different parts of long documents to improve ranking accuracy.
