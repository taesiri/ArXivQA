# [Understanding the Training Speedup from Sampling with Approximate Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is commonly used to train ML models, but vanilla SGD selects samples randomly. Selecting more "important" samples can accelerate training.
- Exact importance sampling is infeasible due to the high computational cost of computing per-sample gradients. 
- Prior work uses approximations like the per-sample loss, but computing exact losses has high overhead for large models.

Proposed Solution:
- Consider a "greedy" SGD variant (GSGD) which selects the sample with highest approximate loss to perform the update.
- Use early exiting to quickly get approximate losses using intermediate layer representations. This is a lightweight way to filter samples.
- Propose SIFT - a practical strategy to backprop on only 50% of samples in a batch with highest approximate losses from early exiting.

Theoretical Contributions:
- Provide convergence guarantees for GSGD with approximate losses, characterizing when it can converge faster than SGD to a constant factor of the minimum loss.
- Quantify probability of early exit-based selection preserving the argmax of actual losses.

Empirical Contributions:
- Apply SIFT to train 12 layer BERT base from scratch. With early exit at layer 1, SIFT takes ~43 hours to reach 64% validation accuracy versus ~57 hours for baseline.
- Show SIFT is better than baseline in terms of sample complexity and wall-clock time. Entropy-based selection does better than loss-based.

In summary, the paper provides an analysis of greedy selection with approximate losses and demonstrates the promise of early exiting to accelerate training of large models like BERT.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper theoretically and empirically studies greedy sample selection with approximate losses for accelerating neural network training, showing benefits over random sampling early on and proposing an efficient approximation method using early exiting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides a theoretical characterization of the benefits and limitations of using approximate losses (instead of exact losses) for greedy sample selection in stochastic gradient descent. Specifically, it shows that greedy SGD with approximate losses can converge to a constant factor of the optimal value faster than standard SGD, but may perform worse asymptotically.

2) It proposes using early exiting to obtain approximate losses for sample selection in a light-weight manner during training of large machine learning models like transformers. This "sample sifting" strategy based on early exiting, called SIFT, is shown to accelerate BERT base model training significantly without any optimized implementation.

3) For linear feedforward neural networks, it quantifies the probability that early exiting preserves the sample with the maximum actual loss as a function of the model weights. This provides some theoretical justification for the efficacy of early exiting for sample selection.

In summary, the main novelty is in providing convergence guarantees for greedy SGD with approximate losses and demonstrating the promise of early exiting for accelerating training in practice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Greedy SGD (GSGD): An optimization algorithm that greedily selects the sample with the largest approximate loss to perform the gradient update at each step, instead of selecting samples randomly like vanilla SGD.

- Early exiting: Using the intermediate layer representations of a neural network to make quick predictions and obtain approximate losses to reduce computation. This is proposed as a way to efficiently implement GSGD.

- SIFT: The proposed training approach of combining GSGD with early exiting to filter samples and backpropagate on only those with large losses. Stands for "sample filtering via early exiting".

- Convergence analysis: The paper provides theoretical analysis bounding the convergence rate of GSGD compared to SGD, characterizing when GSGD can converge faster to a constant factor of the minimum loss.

- Sample selection: The general principle of intelligently selecting certain "important" samples to focus the training on, rather than using randomly selected samples. This is done to accelerate training.

- Approximate losses: Instead of using the exact loss values to select samples, using cheaper, approximate loss values computed from intermediate network representations via early exiting.

So in summary, key ideas involve greedy sample selection, early exiting for efficiency, theoretical analysis of convergence, and the use of approximate losses to enable faster training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using early exiting to obtain approximate losses for greedy sample selection during training. What are some ways the approximation quality of the losses obtained via early exiting could be further improved? For example, could we fine-tune the exits or use ensemble exits?

2. The paper theoretically shows that greedy SGD with approximate losses can converge faster initially compared to vanilla SGD, but may perform worse asymptotically. What modifications could be made to the greedy SGD algorithm to provide asymptotic convergence guarantees while still preserving the initial faster convergence?

3. The paper evaluates the proposed method on BERT pre-training. What challenges do you foresee in applying this method to other large model architectures like GPT or computer vision models? Would the exits need to be designed differently?

4. The convergence analysis provided in the paper is for smooth convex losses. How would you go about extending the analysis to nonconvex losses commonly used to train neural networks? 

5. The paper proposes selecting samples based on loss and entropy criteria computed from early exit representations. Can you think of other potential criteria for greedily selecting important samples that could work well with early exiting?

6. One limitation mentioned is that the initial forward pass for sampling selection is not pipelined with the model update forward/backward passes. What software/hardware optimizations could help pipeline these steps to further improve training efficiency?

7. The performance gains shown are mostly in terms of faster time-to-accuracy. But does the proposed method also provide any benefits in terms of better generalization or model quality compared to baseline training?

8. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to the choice of which intermediate layer is used for early exiting? Is there a principled way to determine the optimal exit location? 

9. The paper focuses on pre-training giant language models like BERT. Do you think similar training acceleration can be obtained for other domains like computer vision or speech where early exiting has also shown promise?

10. The proposed method essentially performs gradient-based optimization on a subset of the true loss surface. Does this incomplete view of the loss landscape cause issues like poor generalization or getting stuck in bad local optima compared to standard training?
