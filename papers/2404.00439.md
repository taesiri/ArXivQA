# [DOCMASTER: A Unified Platform for Annotation, Training, &amp; Inference in   Document Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Applying natural language processing (NLP) models to PDF documents is important for business applications, but organizations face challenges in training custom models due to:
1) Complexity of working with PDF formats - text and layout information needs to be extracted to generate training data
2) Lack of privacy-preserving annotation tools - organizations handle sensitive data and need in-house annotation

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces DocMaster, a unified platform for annotating, training, and inference for document question-answering (QA) tasks. Key highlights:

1. Annotation Interface: 
- Uploads PDFs and enables highlighting text spans as answers to input questions
- Saves layout information and text spans into local database
- Addresses challenges of extracting layout data from PDFs 

2. Model Training:
- Supports state-of-the-art layout-aware and text-only NLP models 
- Annotations and model weights saved locally for privacy

3. Inference Interface: 
- Accepts PDF documents and trained model
- Highlights predicted answer spans for questions in PDF

Main Contributions:
1. Unified platform covering full pipeline - annotation, training, inference - for document QA 
2. Privacy preserving - all processing done on-device, no reliance on 3rd party services
3. Addresses PDF challenges by robustly extracting layout and text  
4. Case study: Helped UCSD office process documents 7x faster with trained QA model

The open-sourced platform enables organizations to build in-house document QA systems tailored to their use cases without privacy concerns.
