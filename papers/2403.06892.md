# [Real-time Transformer-based Open-Vocabulary Detection with Efficient   Fusion Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing object detection models can only detect objects from a fixed set of categories they are trained on, limiting their generalization ability. Meanwhile, transformer-based open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) methods that can recognize objects from natural language descriptions have been developed, but they face efficiency and speed challenges for real-world applications.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes OmDet-Turbo, a real-time transformer-based OVD model. The key contribution is the Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module that addresses bottlenecks in other OVD models:

1. It replaces heavy encoders with a light-weight language-aware encoder that efficiently generates query proposals. 

2. It simplifies vision-language fusion in the decoder by eliminating slow ROIAlign modules, using only simple self-attention and deformable attention.

3. It decouples label and prompt embedding for flexible prompts, enabling language caching and training on larger vocabularies.

Main Contributions:

1. OmDet-Turbo combines efficient inference speed suitable for real-time OD with strong open-vocabulary detection capabilities.

2. The proposed EFH module reduces computation complexity in the encoder and head to improve speed while maintaining accuracy.

3. OmDet-Turbo Base model achieves SOTA results on ODinW (30.1 AP) and OVDEval (26.86 NMS-AP), demonstrating excellent zero-shot detection abilities. 

4. OmDet-Turbo Base achieves 18.6 FPS inference speed using PyTorch and 100.2 FPS optimized with TensorRT, which is up to 20x faster than competing models.

In summary, OmDet-Turbo addresses the need for efficient open-vocabulary detection models that balance speed and accuracy for practical applications. The key efficiency gains from the EFH enable it to achieve SOTA results while running in real-time.
