# [Zero-shot sampling of adversarial entities in biomedical question   answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10527)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly deployed in high-stakes real-world applications like clinical decision support, but their vulnerabilities are not well understood. 
- Specifically, adversarial attacks through named entity substitution can reveal model weaknesses but sampling methods to efficiently generate such attacks are lacking, especially in knowledge-rich domains like biomedicine.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a powerscaled distance-weighted sampling (DWS) method to efficiently sample adversarial entity substitutes in the embedding space of biomedical named entities.
- Apply this approach to generate adversarial distractors in multiple choice questions for biomedical QA. 
- Analyze attack success rates and model explanations to understand two regimes of adversarial entities - those semantically close to or far from anchor points.

Key Contributions:
- First application of DWS for adversarial text attacks and analysis of biphasic characteristic revealing two regimes of adversarial entities.
- New biomedical QA datasets with entity type annotations and FDA drug and disease entity vocabularies as perturbation sets.  
- Evaluation of adversarial vulnerability across general and biomedical LLMs using relative accuracy change, showing superior robustness of smaller biomedical LLM.
- Analysis showing successful attacks also manipulate token-wise Shapley value explanations, making them deceptive.

Overall, the paper introduces an efficient adversarial sampling method tailored for knowledge-rich domains, evaluates model robustness on biomedical QA, and unpacks how explanations can become unreliable after attacks. The insights on model weaknesses motivate further work on reliability and auditing frameworks before real-world LLM deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a powerscaled distance-weighted sampling method to generate adversarial examples by substituting biomedical named entities in multiple choice questions, revealing model vulnerabilities in two regimes and showing that successful attacks manipulate token-wise Shapley value explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a powerscaled distance-weighted sampling method to generate adversarial examples for biomedical question answering. Specifically:

- They introduce a flexible sampling scheme that can traverse between two regimes of adversarial entities - those semantically close to or far away from the key entity in the question. This allows exploring different regions of the attack surface.

- They demonstrate the approach enables more effective attacks compared to random sampling, revealing model vulnerabilities in biomedical QA. The attacks successfully fool large language models, both generalist and specialist models. 

- Their analysis shows models exhibit a "two-regime effect", where adversarial entities in the two distance regimes have different characteristics. Entities closer to the key have more diversity, while those further away are more reusable (transferable).

- They analyze the susceptibility of token-wise Shapley value explanations to adversarial attacks, showing that explanations get manipulated and become deceptive after successful attacks.

In summary, the key contribution is using distance-weighted sampling for adversarial testing of language models for biomedical QA, revealing model vulnerabilities and limitations of standard evaluations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the powerscaled distance-weighted sampling method allow traversing between sampling adversarial entities semantically close to and far away from the anchor point? What are the advantages of this flexibility?

2. The paper talks about a "two-regime effect" exhibited by the sampling method. Can you explain what these two regimes are and what causes this effect? How is it useful?  

3. What were some of the most reusable adversarial entities found using the proposed sampling scheme? What made them more effective adversaries compared to other entities?

4. How exactly does the proposed sampling scheme manipulate the Shapley value explanations of the models? What does this indicate about the susceptibility of model explanations to adversarial attacks?

5. How does the relative change in accuracy (R-CAP) metric allow comparing model robustness across different datasets? What trends were observed regarding model size and robustness using this metric?

6. What differences were noted in the attack statistics and effectiveness between sampling adversarial entities semantically close versus far from the anchor point? What may explain these differences?

7. Why is assessing model performance against adversarial entities important for real-world deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like biomedicine? What risks does the current work highlight?

8. How may the sampling scheme be further improved through sequential sampling or changing the entity vocabulary? What benefits might these modifications provide?

9. How do the findings motivate future work on making language models more reliable against adversarial entities? What approaches seem promising in this regard?

10. What are some ways the proposed distance-weighted sampling methodology could be extended to other machine learning methods like kernel and metric learning methods?
