# [A Generalized Approach to Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper studies online convex optimization, where an agent sequentially makes decisions by querying an oracle, while facing an adversary that chooses a convex loss function in each round.
- Different settings are considered based on the type of oracle (first-order, zeroth-order, stochastic, deterministic), feedback (bandit, semi-bandit, full information), and adversary (oblivious, adaptive).

Proposed Solution
- A key result shows that any semi-bandit algorithm for online linear optimization with adaptive adversaries can be used for online convex optimization with the same type of adversary and regret. This allows transferring linear optimization algorithms.
- Meta-algorithms are provided to convert:
   - Full information algorithms to semi-bandit algorithms
   - Algorithms designed for deterministic oracles to handle stochastic oracles against oblivious adversaries
   - First-order algorithms to zeroth-order algorithms

Main Contributions  
- Established that semi-bandit feedback is enough for online convex optimization with adaptive adversaries.
- Showed that handling deterministic oracles implies handling stochastic oracles against oblivious adversaries. 
- Provided modular meta-algorithms connecting different settings.
- Used the linear to convex result to obtain the first projection-free online convex optimization algorithm with optimal regret based on linear optimization.

In summary, the paper develops a unified approach for online convex optimization that connects different problem settings, and shows that algorithms designed for more difficult settings (like adaptive adversaries) can be automatically transferred to other settings (like stochastic oracles). This allows obtaining optimal and efficient algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing online convex optimization algorithms by establishing connections between settings with different types of feedback, adversaries, and regret notions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It establishes that any semi-bandit feedback online linear/quadratic optimization algorithm for fully adaptive adversaries can be used as an online convex/strongly convex optimization algorithm with comparable regret bounds (Theorem 1). This allows transferring results between these settings.

2) It shows that for online convex optimization with fully adaptive adversaries, semi-bandit feedback is generally enough, and algorithms designed for full-information feedback can be converted to use only semi-bandit feedback with the same regret bounds (Theorem 2). 

3) It demonstrates that algorithms designed for fully adaptive adversaries using deterministic feedback can obtain similar regret bounds with stochastic feedback against oblivious adversaries, without needing variance reduction techniques (Theorem 3). 

4) It provides a general framework to convert first order algorithms to zeroth order algorithms with comparable regret bounds, using a smoothing technique (Theorems 4 and 5). This allows transferring results between bandit, semi-bandit and full information settings.

5) As an application, it gives the first efficient projection-free online convex optimization algorithm using only linear optimization oracles, by applying the above results to the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader algorithm.

In summary, the paper provides a unified approach for analyzing and converting between different settings of online convex optimization, establishing connections between regret bounds across these settings.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper shows that any online linear optimization algorithm can be used for online convex optimization. Does this connection extend to other function classes beyond convex, such as strongly convex or smooth functions?

2. The reduction from full information to semi-bandit feedback relies on constructing quadratic functions from the gradient. Could other function constructions lead to tighter regret bounds?

3. For handling stochastic bandit feedback, the paper uses a one-point estimator. Have the authors considered using more sophisticated variance reduction techniques? 

4. The projection-free algorithm uses linear optimization as a subroutine. What is the practical performance if standard solvers versus first-order methods are used?

5. The regret bounds hold for any bounded convex set. Do the results still apply if the convex set is unbounded but functions are coercive?

6. How does the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader algorithm compare empirically to other projection-free methods on benchmark problems?

7. Can the techniques be extended to handle time-varying constraint sets or switching costs between different bases?

8. What convergence rates can be proven for the last-iterate of the algorithm instead of the static regret?

9. How do the high-probability regret bounds translate into probably approximately correct style convergence guarantees?

10. The reduction shows semi-bandit feedback suffices versus full information. Does this connection hold for other performance measures like dynamic regret?
