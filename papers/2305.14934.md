# [Discriminator-Guided Multi-step Reasoning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14934)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis seems to be:

Discriminator-guided decoding can improve the multi-step reasoning abilities of language models by nudging them towards generating correct intermediate reasoning steps. 

The key ideas relevant to this hypothesis are:

- Language models are often miscalibrated - they assign high probabilities to incorrect solutions. This leads greedy decoding to produce invalid reasoning chains.

- Methods like self-consistency and verifiers operate on the level of complete solutions rather than individual steps. They do not directly address the miscalibration issue.

- The proposed method GRACE uses a discriminator to score candidate next steps based on correctness. By integrating these correctness scores into the decoding process, it guides the model towards sampling more valid reasoning trajectories. 

- The discriminator provides finer-grained step-level control compared to previous methods. It is trained using a novel alignment algorithm and max-margin loss without requiring any human annotations.

- Experiments on math reasoning datasets demonstrate GRACE improves answer accuracy and reasoning correctness over baselines like greedy decoding and self-consistency.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a step-level correctness discriminator can be used to guide decoding and enhance language models' multi-step reasoning abilities. The results support this hypothesis and highlight the benefits of integrating intermediate step information into the decoding process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called GRACE (G uiding Multi-step R eas oning with a C orrectnE ss Di scriminator) for improving the multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. 

The key ideas are:

- Introducing a discriminator model that is trained to score the correctness of each reasoning step. This allows guiding the decoding process towards generating valid steps.

- Proposing a novel 3-step approach to train the discriminator without any step-level human annotations, by aligning and comparing model-generated solutions to reference solutions.

- Integrating the discriminator in a stepwise decoding process to nudge the language model towards logical and mathematically sound reasoning chains.

- Showing that GRACE significantly improves performance over greedy decoding and other baselines on multiple math reasoning datasets, in terms of both final answer accuracy and intermediate step correctness.

- Demonstrating the applicability of GRACE to language models of different sizes and families like T5 and LLaMA without any fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel way to leverage a correctness discriminator to guide multi-step decoding and enhance reasoning, which does not require model re-training or human step annotations. The method is shown to boost reasoning performance over strong baselines across several benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new method called Discriminator-Guided Multistep Reasoning for improving the multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. The key idea is to use a discriminator model to guide the decoding process towards generating correct reasoning steps, thereby improving both final answer accuracy and intermediate step correctness on math reasoning benchmarks. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between correct and incorrect steps without requiring any human annotations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of improving multi-step reasoning with language models:

- The key idea of using a discriminator model to guide the decoding towards more correct reasoning steps is novel. Other work has used discriminators for controlled text generation, but applying this idea at the step level for multi-step reasoning problems is new. 

- The approach of training the discriminator without any human step-level annotations is creative. It avoids the expense and difficulty of collecting a large labeled dataset. Using an alignment algorithm on sampled solutions is an interesting way to create the training data automatically.

- The paper comprehensively compares to several strong baselines like greedy decoding, self-consistency, and sample-then-rank verifiers. Showing improvements over all of them demonstrates the strength of the proposed method. The combination with self-consistency is especially promising.

- The focus on not requiring any model tuning and being applicable even with large pretrained LMs like LLama is powerful. Many other techniques require model fine-tuning which can be cumbersome and lead to overfitting.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into the approach, like the effect of discriminator size and loss function. The analyses help convey an understanding of why and how the method works.

- The evaluation goes beyond just final answer accuracy to also measure the correctness of intermediate steps. Using both human evaluation and LLM-based evaluation to assess step correctness is thorough.

Overall, the paper introduces an innovative application of discriminators to directly address the calibration issue of LMs for multi-step reasoning. The comprehensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the promise of this idea. The method's flexibility to work without any model tuning is a major advantage. The paper makes excellent contributions to improving reasoning with large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the paper:

1. Iteratively training the discriminator. The authors propose iterating the 3-step training process for the discriminator, where they would sample solutions using GRACE, perform alignment on these solutions, and re-train the discriminator. This could further improve the discriminator's ability to guide the decoding towards more correct solutions.

2. Extending the approach to logical and symbolic reasoning tasks beyond math word problems. The authors state that applying their approach to tasks like proof generation is a promising direction for future work.

3. Combining GRACE with prompt-based methods. The authors note that their decoding approach operates on the output-side and could be combined with input-side prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.

4. Using GRACE to improve the reasoning of very large language models. The authors show improvements from using a discriminator that is significantly smaller than the language model, indicating the potential for using small discriminators to steer the generation of huge language models.

5. Exploring different sampling methods like quasi-rejection sampling. The authors note their approach could leverage recent advances in sampling from discrete energy-based models.

In summary, the main future directions are iteratively training the discriminator, applying the approach to more reasoning tasks, combining it with prompting methods, using it to improve very large LLMs, and exploring advanced sampling techniques. The overall goal is to further improve the multi-step reasoning abilities of language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Discriminator-Guided Multi-step Reasoning with Language Models (GRACE) to improve the reasoning ability of language models on multi-step problems. The key issue is that language models are often miscalibrated, assigning high probabilities to incorrect solutions. GRACE uses a discriminator model to score candidate next steps based on their correctness during the decoding process, guiding the model towards more accurate reasoning chains. The discriminator is trained using an alignment procedure between sampled incorrect solutions and reference solutions to create correct/incorrect step examples, without needing human annotations. GRACE is evaluated on math reasoning datasets with two language models, FLAN-T5 and LLaMA, and shows significant gains over greedy decoding and self-consistency baselines in both final answer and step accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a correctness discriminator to steer decoding and boost language models' reasoning skills, without requiring model fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper introduces Discriminator-Guided Multi-step Reasoning with Language Models (GRACE), which is a new method for improving the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) on multi-step problems. GRACE utilizes a correctness discriminator that is trained to distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps. The discriminator is then used during decoding to guide the LM towards generating valid reasoning steps and avoiding mistakes, with the goal of producing more accurate final answers. 

GRACE does not require any LM fine-tuning or re-training. The discriminator is trained using an alignment algorithm on samples from the original LM distribution to identify correct versus incorrect steps. Experiments on four math reasoning datasets show that GRACE significantly outperforms greedy decoding and other baselines in terms of both final answer accuracy and intermediate step correctness. Combining GRACE with self-consistency further improves performance. The results demonstrate that steering the decoding process using the discriminator is an effective approach for boosting reasoning performance. The discriminators are shown to work well even when significantly smaller than the LM. Overall, GRACE provides an innovative way to improve multi-step reasoning without needing to modify the original LM.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called \model (Guide Multi-step Reasoning with Correctness Discriminators) for improving the multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. The key idea is to use a discriminator model during decoding to guide the language model towards generating correct reasoning steps. The discriminator is trained to score the correctness of each intermediate step using a novel 3-step process: (1) Sample incorrect solutions from the language model, (2) Align the incorrect solutions with reference solutions to identify incorrect steps, and (3) Train the discriminator with a max-margin loss to distinguish between correct and incorrect steps. During decoding, the discriminator scores candidate next steps and the model selects the step with the highest score. This allows steering the language model away from invalid reasoning trajectories. The method is evaluated on math reasoning tasks and shown to outperform greedy decoding and self-consistency techniques by a significant margin without requiring any training of the language model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper seems to be addressing the issue of getting language models to correctly perform multi-step reasoning. Specifically, it notes that standard language models often struggle with complex multi-step reasoning problems, where they can assign high probabilities to incorrect solutions. 

The key problem being addressed is that language models are often miscalibrated with respect to correctness when it comes to multi-step reasoning - their probabilities do not accurately reflect the likelihood of a solution being correct. This makes it difficult to elicit valid multi-step reasoning chains from language models using standard decoding techniques like greedy decoding or beam search.

To address this issue, the paper introduces a new method called "Discriminator-Guided Multi-step Reasoning with Language Models" (GRACE). The key idea is to use a discriminator model to guide the decoding process towards correct reasoning steps. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning steps. During decoding, it is used to adjust the sampling probabilities to favor correct steps, steering the language model away from logical errors.

In summary, the key problem being addressed is the miscalibration of language models with respect to correctness when performing complex multi-step reasoning. The proposed solution is a guided decoding method using a correctness discriminator to nudge the language model towards logical, valid reasoning chains.
