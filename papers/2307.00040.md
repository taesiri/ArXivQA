# [DisCo: Disentangled Control for Referring Human Dance Generation in Real   World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00040)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:How can we generate realistic human dance images and videos that are faithful to a given reference image, generalizable to unseen subjects/poses/backgrounds, and composable from different image sources? The key challenges they aim to address are:- Maintaining fidelity and consistency of human appearance and background when altering the pose.- Generalizing to novel combinations of human subjects, poses, and backgrounds without needing human-specific fine-tuning. - Allowing flexible composition of seen or unseen elements (subjects, poses, backgrounds) sourced from different images.To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a new framework called DisCo with two key components:1) A model architecture with disentangled control of human foreground, background, and pose to improve faithfulness and compositionality. 2) A human attribute pre-training strategy to enhance generalizability by learning diverse human attributes from large-scale human image datasets.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by disentangling control and leveraging diverse human pre-training data, their proposed DisCo framework can generate realistic and controllable human dance content that is faithful, generalizable, and composable. The experiments aim to demonstrate DisCo's abilities on these fronts compared to prior arts.
