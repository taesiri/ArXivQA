# [DisCo: Disentangled Control for Referring Human Dance Generation in Real   World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00040)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

How can we generate realistic human dance images and videos that are faithful to a given reference image, generalizable to unseen subjects/poses/backgrounds, and composable from different image sources? 

The key challenges they aim to address are:

- Maintaining fidelity and consistency of human appearance and background when altering the pose.

- Generalizing to novel combinations of human subjects, poses, and backgrounds without needing human-specific fine-tuning. 

- Allowing flexible composition of seen or unseen elements (subjects, poses, backgrounds) sourced from different images.

To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a new framework called DisCo with two key components:

1) A model architecture with disentangled control of human foreground, background, and pose to improve faithfulness and compositionality. 

2) A human attribute pre-training strategy to enhance generalizability by learning diverse human attributes from large-scale human image datasets.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that by disentangling control and leveraging diverse human pre-training data, their proposed DisCo framework can generate realistic and controllable human dance content that is faithful, generalizable, and composable. The experiments aim to demonstrate DisCo's abilities on these fronts compared to prior arts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It defines a new problem setting called "referring human dance generation", which focuses on synthesizing realistic human dance images/videos with controllable attributes like human subject, background, and pose. This is motivated by real-world applications like user-specific short video generation.

2. It proposes a novel framework called DisCo to address this problem. DisCo has two key components:

(a) A model architecture with disentangled control of human foreground, background, and pose. This is designed to ensure faithfulness and compositionality in the generated content. 

(b) A human attribute pre-training strategy to improve generalization to unseen human subjects. This avoids the need for subject-specific fine-tuning.

3. It provides extensive experiments on human image editing and dance video generation tasks to demonstrate DisCo's effectiveness. The results show DisCo can generate high quality and controllable human-centric content while generalizing well to novel combinations of human subjects, backgrounds, and poses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the DisCo framework to enable controllable and realistic referring human dance generation, which could facilitate applications like image/video editing and content creation. The disentangled control architecture and human attribute pre-training are key innovations to achieving faithfulness, compositionality and generalizability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in controllable image/video generation:

- Compared to other diffusion models for text-to-image/video generation (e.g. DALL-E 2, Imagen, Make-A-Video), this paper focuses more on precise control over human appearance, background, and pose in a dance setting. The proposed DisCo model aims for better faithfulness, generalizability, and compositionality.

- For human dance synthesis, previous work relied on video-to-video transfer, still image animation, or motion transfer methods. These often require person-specific fine-tuning or cascaded training stages. DisCo simplifies training with a unified model and pre-training strategy. 

- DisCo builds upon recent advances like Stable Diffusion and ControlNet for controllable generation. The key novelty is the disentangled control mechanism and human attribute pre-training. This enables better adaptation to unseen combinations of subjects, backgrounds, and poses.

- Compared to the most related DreamPose model, DisCo shows substantially better quantitative scores and qualitative results on real-world dance synthesis. This highlights the benefits of the proposed approach for faithful and generalizable human-centric generation.

- The problem formulation of "referring human dance generation" is new and focused on practical applications. DisCo represents an advance towards controllable generation of real-world content, whereas much prior work used cleaner datasets.

In summary, DisCo makes notable research contributions in controllable human image/video generation, introducing architectural innovations for disentangled control and compositional generalization. The evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art results on challenging real-world dance synthesis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Incorporating hand keypoints for more fine-grained control of hand pose. The current method focuses primarily on body pose, but adding hand keypoints could allow for more intricate hand gestures and poses to be specified. 

- Explicit temporal modeling to improve temporal consistency, especially for motions with large frame-to-frame changes. The current approach achieves good consistency without explicit modeling, but large motions could still benefit from temporal constraints.

- Extending the method to more complex scenarios like multi-person dance generation and human-object interactions. The current method focuses on single person dance generation. Expanding to multi-person would require reasoning about occlusions, interactions, etc. Adding objects would require understanding hand-object and body-object relationships.

- Scaling up the model size and training data. The authors suggest their method could benefit from larger models and datasets, which could potentially improve the quality and diversity of generated content.

- Combining with subject-specific fine-tuning techniques for better personalization. The pretrained model could be further tailored to a specific person with techniques like LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

- Applications like editing real videos by manipulating foreground, background, and pose. The controllability of the method could enable applications like editing existing dance videos by changing components.

- Exploring other domains beyond dance, such as sports or calisthenics. The human-centric control could apply to other types of human motions beyond just dance.

So in summary, the key directions are improving control, generalizability, and applicability by expanding the types of motions, subjects, and scenarios the model can handle. Scaling up the models and data as well as combining with personalization techniques are also suggested to further improve quality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called \ourmodel for referring human dance generation in real world settings. The key idea is to introduce disentangled control over the human foreground, background, and pose conditions in order to improve faithfulness, generalizability, and compositionality of dance image/video synthesis. The method has two main components: (1) A model architecture with separate cross-attention and ControlNet branches to independently process the foreground, background, and pose conditions. This enables precise pose control while maintaining attribute/background consistency. (2) A human attribute pre-training task that reconstructs images from segmented foreground/background. This allows learning diverse human appearance from large image datasets, improving generalization to unseen subjects. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on dance video generation benchmarks. Qualitative results showcase applications like human image editing by flexibly composing novel subjects, backgrounds, and poses. Overall, the proposed \ourmodel framework presents an important advance towards controllable and adaptable human dance generation in real-world settings.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called \ourmodel for referring human dance generation. Referring human dance generation aims to synthesize realistic human dance images or videos of a person given a reference image of that person and a target pose or sequence of poses. The key challenge is generating results that are faithful to the reference image's human subject and background, while precisely following the target pose. 

To achieve this, \ourmodel uses two main techniques: 1) A model architecture with disentangled control that separates the human subject, background, and pose conditions. This allows precise control over the pose while maintaining consistency in the human appearance and background. 2) A pre-training strategy called human attribute pre-training that reconstructs human images without pose changes. This helps the model learn to encode diverse human attributes before fine-tuning for dance generation. Experiments demonstrate \ourmodel can generate high-quality dance images/videos that are faithful, generalizable to new subjects/poses, and composable from different image sources. The results significantly outperform recent state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called \ourmodel for referring human dance generation. The key idea is to have disentangled control over the human foreground, background, and pose conditions to enable faithful and compositional image synthesis. Specifically, the human foreground image is encoded via cross-attention modules in the U-Net architecture to preserve attributes. The background and pose are controlled via separate ControlNet branches that manipulate the U-Net features. To improve generalization to unseen humans, a novel pretraining task called human attribute pretraining is introduced. Here the model reconstructs human images without pose by conditioning on separated foreground and background patches. This allows learning varied human appearances from large-scale human image datasets before fine-tuning for dance generation. The model architecture and pretraining enable \ourmodel to synthesize human dances with precisely controlled attributes, backgrounds, and motions in a fully compositional way.
