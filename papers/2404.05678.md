# [Flexible Fairness Learning via Inverse Conditional Permutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05678)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing algorithms for achieving equalized odds fairness can only handle one protected attribute (e.g. race or gender). However, in many applications, there is a need to mitigate biases related to multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously. Additionally, handling continuous sensitive attributes under the equalized odds framework is still less explored. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new fairness learning approach called FairICP that can flexibly handle multiple sensitive attributes, potentially of mixed types (continuous/categorical), to achieve equalized odds. The key ideas are:

(1) Generate a resampled version of sensitive attributes, called $\tilde{A}$, using a novel inverse conditional permutation (ICP) strategy. Specifically, ICP permutes the response $Y$ conditioned on $A$ to avoid directly estimating the multidimensional density of $A|Y$. 

(2) Show theoretically that asymptotically the equalized odds condition holds between the prediction $\hat{Y}$, permuted attributes $\tilde{A}$ and labels $Y$.

(3) Construct a discriminator network to push the joint distribution of $(\hat{Y}, A, Y)$ to be close to the distribution of $(\hat{Y}, \tilde{A}, Y)$ using an adversarial learning framework.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a novel ICP strategy to generate resampled sensitive attributes without estimating the multi-dimensional conditional density $A|Y$. This allows handling complex/continuous $A$.

- Provide theory showing ICP leads to asymptotic equalized odds while circumventing density estimation challenges.

- Demonstrate improved efficacy and flexibility of FairICP over existing methods through simulations and analysis of real datasets. Can handle mixed type and multidimensional $A$.

- Introduce the use of a nonparametric conditional dependence measure (KPC) to reliably quantify equalized odds violations.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in developing flexible and practical algorithms to mitigate bias and ensure fairness regarding multiple sensitive attributes.
