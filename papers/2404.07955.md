# [Triple Component Matrix Factorization: Untangling Global, Local, and   Noisy Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of extracting common (global) and unique (local) low-rank features from multiple noisy observation matrices, where the noise can be sparse but have arbitrarily large values. This is challenging because the number of unknown parameters (global, local features and noise) is approximately three times the number of observations. Existing methods either do not handle outliers robustly or lack theoretical guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a method called Triple Component Matrix Factorization (TCMF) to provably separate the global features, local features and sparse noise. TCMF is based on an alternating minimization approach involving two steps:

1. Use hard thresholding to estimate the sparse noise component.

2. Apply an inner optimization algorithm (like personalized PCA or HMF) to extract global and local low-rank features from the denoised observations, by solving a nonconvex problem.

Despite the nonconvex and nonsmooth nature of the overall problem, the paper shows that under certain "identifiability conditions" on incoherence and misalignment of features, as well as sparsity of noise, TCMF guarantees linear convergence to the ground truth components.

Main Contributions:

- Derives a new set of sufficient identifiability conditions for exactly recovering the triple components 

- Proposes an efficient distributed algorithm TCMF with convergence guarantees, which can leverage existing methods like personalized PCA or HMF

- Provides a sample complexity bound in terms of key problem parameters like rank, noise sparsity, number of clients etc.

- Introduces a new perturbation analysis technique by expressing solutions of the inner problem's KKT conditions as convergent Taylor-like series 

- Demonstrates the effectiveness of TCMF on tasks like video segmentation and anomaly detection compared to other benchmarks

The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions for an important problem of extracting robust low-rank patterns from heterogeneous noisy data.
