# [Max-Affine Spline Insights Into Deep Network Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02338v4)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we gain novel insights into deep network pruning techniques using a max-affine spline interpretation of deep networks?

More specifically, the authors aim to:

- Bridge the connection between spline theory and network pruning techniques to provide explicit visualization and new understanding of how pruning affects a network's decision boundaries.

- Discover that a network's spline mapping exhibits an "early-bird" phenomenon where the spline partition converges early in training, allowing detection of prunable subnetworks. 

- Leverage these insights to develop a principled and efficient pruning strategy that focuses on pruning nodes with redundant contributions to the spline partition.

The central hypothesis appears to be that viewing deep networks through the lens of spline theory can lead to new theoretical analysis and development of network pruning techniques. The authors test this by using the spline viewpoint to interpret existing pruning methods, detect early-bird tickets in a pruning-invariant way, and derive a new pruning algorithm.

In summary, the paper aims to demonstrate the utility of the max-affine spline perspective for deepening understanding and advancing the state-of-the-art in network pruning research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Providing a novel spline-based perspective to interpret and analyze pruning techniques in deep neural networks. Specifically, the authors connect pruning operations (e.g. removing nodes or weights) to alterations in the network's underlying input space partitioning and per-region affine mappings. 

2. Discovering an "early-bird" (EB) phenomenon where the spline partitioning of a network converges early in training, which allows detection of prune-ready networks regardless of the pruning method. The authors propose a partition distance metric to quantify this.

3. Leveraging these insights to develop a new spline-based pruning technique focused on removing redundant nodes that do not contribute meaningfully to the decision boundary.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed spline-based pruning method achieves superior efficiency (~3.5x FLOPs reduction) and accuracy compared to prior state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark datasets and models.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be in providing a theoretical spline perspective to deeply understand and improve pruning in neural networks, validated through the development of a new pruning algorithm and extensive experiments. The early-bird detection via spline trajectory monitoring also appears to be a notable contribution for efficient pruning.
