# [The "Colonial Impulse" of Natural Language Processing: An Audit of   Bengali Sentiment Analysis Tools and Their Identity-based Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10535)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis tools are widely used to analyze text data and guide decision-making, but they can perpetuate biases and unfairness, especially for marginalized communities. 
- There is little research examining biases in non-English sentiment analysis tools, including for languages like Bengali that have complex colonial histories shaping social identities and hierarchies.

Methods:
- The authors conducted an algorithmic audit, systematically testing 13 Bengali sentiment analysis tools from GitHub and PyPI using an existing dataset of 25,000+ Bengali sentences expressing different gender, religious, and national identities. 
- They statistically compared the sentiment scores these tools assigned to identical sentences and to implicit vs explicit expressions of identities to assess inconsistencies and biases.

Key Findings:
- Different tools assign significantly different sentiment scores to the same sentences, challenging assumptions of universality and objectivity in sentiment analysis.
- Tools perceive explicit mentions of identities as more negative than implicit expressions. 
- Most tools exhibit biases, consistently scoring certain gender, religious, or national identities as more positive than others, in ways reflecting and reanimating colonial hierarchies.

Contributions:  
- Provides empirical evidence that sentiment analysis tools exhibit "colonial impulses" by relying on problematic assumptions and perpetuating unfair biases, using the understudied context of Bengali tools and identities.
- Calls for collaboration among marginalized technology developers, accountability in tool development, and critical engagement of the historical and sociocultural context when studying algorithmic systems.
- Contributes methodologically through an algorithmic audit approach that quantitatively evaluates biases while also qualitatively interpreting the meaning and implications of results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper audits available Bengali sentiment analysis tools to examine inconsistencies in their outputs, their biases regarding gender, religious, and nationality-based identities in the context of historically colonized Bengali communities, and the relationship between tools' biases and developers' demographics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an algorithmic audit of available Bengali sentiment analysis (BSA) tools to understand whether and how they exhibit identity-based biases. Specifically, the paper:

1) Conducts statistical tests on 13 BSA tools using a bias evaluation dataset to see if their sentiment scores differ significantly when expressing various gender, religious, and nationality-based identities explicitly vs. implicitly. The analysis finds inconsistencies among tools and tools perceiving explicit identity expressions as more negative.  

2) Examines if these tools are biased towards certain gender, religious, or nationality groups that have been impacted by colonial histories. The paper finds most tools exhibit bias aligning with colonial hierarchies (e.g. favoring Muslim over Hindu identities).

3) Connects the quantitative findings to qualitative literatures on identity and colonialism to argue that BSA tools exhibit a "colonial impulse" - resembling biases and stereotypes shaped by and through colonial rule in the studied communities.  

4) Calls for engineering activism and collaborations among marginalized technology developers to mitigate issues stemming from the lack of diversity among current BSA tool creators.

In focusing on non-English language technology audits and connecting those to postcolonial theories, the paper makes broader contributions highlighting issues of bias and fairness in NLP specifically among historically marginalized communities/languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Sentiment analysis - The paper is examining sentiment analysis tools for the Bengali language and auditing them for biases. Sentiment analysis is a key focus. 

- Colonialism - The paper discusses how colonialism has impacted Bengali identity and examines whether sentiment analysis tools perpetuate colonial biases. 

- Identity - The paper looks at biases related to gender, religious, and national identities in sentiment analysis tools. Expressions of identity are a core theme.

- Bias - A main research question is examining biases in sentiment analysis systems related to different Bengali identities. Algorithmic bias and fairness are central topics.

- Audit - The methodology used is an algorithmic audit, querying sentiment tools with text expressing different identities to detect biases.

- Bengalis - The paper focuses specifically on sentiment analysis in the context of the Bengali language and Bengali ethnic identity. 

- Postcolonial computing - The paper draws on postcolonial computing perspectives to critically analyze and interpret the findings regarding bias.

Some other potentially relevant terms are algorithms, language technology, machine learning, natural language processing, and social computing. But the core focus seems to be using an algorithmic audit approach to understand identity and colonial biases in Bengali sentiment analysis tools.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests for hypothesis testing. What was the rationale behind choosing between parametric and non-parametric tests? What are the tradeoffs between these two kinds of tests?

2. The authors used the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normality of the sentiment score distributions. What are some alternative tests for checking normality assumptions and what are their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

3. For RQ1a, the paper utilized the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Conover-Iman posthoc tests. What is the motivation behind using the Conover-Iman test specifically after the Kruskal-Wallis test? What are some other posthoc tests that could have been used?

4. The significance level alpha was set at 0.0025 in this study. What are the implications of using a stringent significance threshold? How does it impact the chance of Type I and Type II errors?

5. The paper mentions using a Bonferroni correction for adjusting the significance level in posthoc comparisons. What is the mathematical basis and rationale behind using Bonferroni correction? When is it appropriate or inappropriate to use?

6. For RQ1b, RQ2a and RQ2b, different statistical tests were used based on considerations like normality, paired/unpaired data etc. Discuss the thought process behind selecting each of those tests and what would have changed if different tests were used instead.

7. The study evaluated statistical power by repeating each test 10 times with subset of data. What were the criteria for selecting number of repetitions and subset size? What are the tradeoffs in power evaluation by changing those parameters?

8. The sentiment scores were normalized to a 0-1 range to enable comparison. What are some alternative standardization methods? Would using other methods significantly impact the statistical testing methodology or results?

9. The study made multiple pairwise statistical comparisons between tools and identity categories. How does this impact familywise error rate? Were additional corrections necessary beyond the Bonferroni method used?

10. What are some limitations of the statistical testing methodology used in this study? What enhancements or additional analyses could have provided more rigorous results?
