# [Multi-Robot Autonomous Exploration and Mapping Under Localization   Uncertainty with Expectation-Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of autonomous exploration and mapping for teams of mobile robots operating in environments with localization uncertainty. Specific challenges include:

- Managing the uncertainty in the map construction process introduced by sensor noise, motion errors, and lack of features for localization. This is critical for operating in environments like underwater where GPS signals are unavailable.

- Efficiently coordinating and distributing exploration tasks among the robot team members to maximize coverage of the unknown environment.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an asynchronous multi-robot exploration algorithm based on expectation-maximization that considers both map uncertainty and efficient task allocation. The key components are:

- A factor graph SLAM system is used for simultaneous localization and mapping by the robots. 

- A virtual map is constructed from past robot trajectories and observations to quantify prevailing localization uncertainties. Virtual landmarks represent map cells.

- An iterative expectation-maximization procedure evaluates potential next target locations for each robot by predicting future states and observations. This accounts for effects of interactions between robots.  

- Target location selection optimizes a utility function that balances reducing map uncertainty (using the virtual map), efficient task allocation among robots, and distance to target.

- The approach can be implemented in a decentralized manner while still considering inter-robot interactions and uncertainty propagation.

Main Contributions:

- Novel asynchronous multi-robot exploration framework that handles map uncertainty for both centralized and decentralized teams

- Introduction of virtual maps and an EM-based technique to estimate impact of a robot's future actions and interactions with teammates 

- Efficient inter-robot and local map uncertainty propagation method suited for multi-robot localization uncertainty

- Demonstrated performance improvement over other state-of-the-art multi-robot exploration approaches in simulation experiments

The approach focuses on reducing map uncertainty while coordinating efficient exploration, making it well-suited for applications like underwater or GPS-denied environments. Future work includes validation on real robots using the team's decentralized SLAM system.
