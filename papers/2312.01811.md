# [Energy-based Potential Games for Joint Motion Forecasting and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01811)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Energy-based Potential Games (EPOs) that connects concepts from differential games, optimal control, and energy-based models. The key idea is to model multi-agent interactions using game theory, where agents aim to optimize individual cost functions. However, solving such games requires knowing parameters like agent goals and preferences that are often unknown. The authors show how to formulate the game as an energy minimization problem with learnable parameters, enabling the use of neural networks for inference. They introduce a differentiable Energy-based Potential Game Layer (EPOL) that combines neural networks to predict parameters and initializations with a game-theoretic optimization layer. Experiments on simulation and real datasets for motion forecasting and control demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines. A key benefit is interpretability - visualizing intermediate feature weights provides insights into decision-making. Overall, this work establishes a novel connection between fields and shows practical benefits of the proposed EPO framework for modeling multi-agent interactions.
