# [STEREOFOG -- Computational DeFogging via Image-to-Image Translation on a   real-world Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adverse weather like fog significantly impairs the vision of autonomous vehicles, which is a major barrier to achieving full (SAE level 4/5) autonomy. Removing fog computationally could help address this challenge. 
- Image-to-image (I2I) translation using paired clear-foggy images is a promising approach for computational defogging. However, real-world paired foggy-clear datasets don't exist.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors built a custom binocular camera setup with one foggy and one clear compartment to capture synchronized image pairs of real foggy and clear scenes.
- They collected the "Stereofog" dataset - the only one of its kind - containing 10,067 real-world foggy and clear image pairs with varying fog density.
- They optimized various hyperparameters of the popular I2I framework "pix2pix" on this dataset to translate foggy images to clear ones.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of the first real-world paired foggy-clear image dataset ("Stereofog") to enable computational defogging via supervised learning.
- Demonstration of fog removal on real images using the "pix2pix" I2I framework, achieving decent performance (average CW-SSIM score of 0.76 on test data).
- Analysis of the impact of fog density on computational defogging performance.
- Identification of limitations (overexposure, dataset diversity and size, model bias) and future work avenues (more diverse data, better models, image recognition on defogged images, uncertainty quantification).

In summary, the paper makes an important pioneering step towards computational defogging by creating a novel real-world paired dataset and showing promising defogging results using an I2I technique. But more work is needed to make such systems practical.
