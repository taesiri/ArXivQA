# [GTA: Guided Transfer of Spatial Attention from Object-Centric   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision Transformers (ViTs) require a large amount of training data to achieve good performance. When trained on limited data, they tend to lose the valuable representations learned during pre-training and end up focusing on non-object areas in images. 

- Common transfer learning techniques like L2-SP and BSS also don't fully leverage the rich representations from pre-trained models when fine-tuned on small datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Guided Transfer of Spatial Attention (GTA), a simple yet effective transfer learning method tailored for ViT. 

- GTA explicitly regularizes the spatial attention logits between the pre-trained source model and the target model being fine-tuned using an L2 distance loss.

- This guides the target model to focus on image regions that require attention for the task while retaining properties from the source model.

Main Contributions:

- GTA consistently outperforms baseline fine-tuning and other transfer learning techniques like L2-SP and BSS on multiple fine-grained classification datasets, especially in low-data regimes.

- Experiments show the importance of guiding the spatial attention logits compared to other ViT outputs like MSA features or transformer block outputs.

- Analyzing attention maps confirms that GTA helps focus on foreground objects while basic fine-tuning loses this and attends to background regions.

- GTA also improves performance when combined with TransMix, an augmentation technique relying on good attention maps.

- Ablation studies analyze the impact of using different source models and regularization strengths.

In summary, the paper presents a simple yet effective spatial attention regularization approach to better leverage representations from pre-trained ViTs for transfer learning when target data is limited.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel transfer learning method called Guided Transfer of spatial Attention (GTA) which improves Vision Transformer performance by explicitly regularizing the spatial self-attention logits between the source and target models to leverage object-centric representations from the source especially when training data is limited.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1) The authors propose a simple yet effective transfer learning technique for Vision Transformer (ViT) named Guided Transfer of spatial Attention (GTA). GTA explicitly regularizes the self-attention logits of a downstream network (target network) through a squared L2 distance to effectively leverage pre-trained knowledge containing discriminative attention.

2) Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, the authors demonstrate that as the amount of training data decreases, the likelihood of self-attention in ViT deviating from the pre-trained model and concentrating on non-object regions increases. The proposed GTA method mitigates this issue and consistently improves accuracy, especially when the training data is limited.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of GTA, a novel and simple regularization method to improve ViT's transfer learning performance by guiding the spatial attention to focus more on foreground objects. The effectiveness of GTA is shown through comprehensive experiments highlighting its superiority over other transfer learning techniques.

The paper proposes a transfer learning method called "Guided Transfer of spatial Attention" (GTA) for Vision Transformers. Itregularizes the self-attention logits between a pre-trained source model and the target model during fine-tuning to prevent the degradation of well-trained representations and effectively leverage them. Terms like self-attention, attention maps/logits, transfer learning, fine-tuning, vision transformers, self-supervised learning etc. are central to describing their method and experiments around it. The goal is to improve performance especially when training data is limited by guiding the model to focus on foreground objects and preventing shortcut learning.
