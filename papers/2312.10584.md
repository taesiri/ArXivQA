# [Policy Optimization in RLHF: The Impact of Out-of-preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper examines methods for aligning intelligent agents with human preferences and values. Specifically, it compares two types of alignment methods:

1) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Directly learns a policy from human preference data without a separate reward model. 

2) Reward-Model-Based Policy Optimization (RMB-PO): Learns a reward model from preference data, then uses policy optimization with additional out-of-preference data to improve the policy.

It is unclear which method is better since the policy model has generalization abilities and can potentially perform well even without additional data. 

Proposed Solution
The paper conducts controlled experiments on two contextual bandit tasks to compare DPO, RMB-PO and a variant RMB-PO+ that uses extra unlabeled data. The tasks use linear and neural function approximation. 

The key finding is that RMB-PO methods outperform DPO substantially, showing the benefit of policy optimization with out-of-preference data. This remains true even when the policy model shares the same good feature representation as the reward model. RMB-PO+ further improves over RMB-PO by reducing approximation errors.

Main Contributions
- Provides a stochastic optimization perspective to interpret DPO and RMB-PO methods as approximations to the reward maximization objective.
- Conducts controlled experiments showing substantial gains from out-of-preference data in RMB-PO methods.
- Discusses connections to imitation learning and RL, aligning with findings on the benefits of data augmentation techniques. 
- Underscores the importance of policy optimization on out-of-preference data to unlock generalization capabilities of the learned reward model.

In summary, the paper clearly demonstrates the superiority of RMB-PO methods over DPO thanks to more accurate stochastic approximation, enabled by additional out-of-preference data.
