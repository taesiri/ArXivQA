# [Adaptive Bounding Box Uncertainties via Two-Step Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07263)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on quantifying predictive uncertainty for multi-object detection models, which is important for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, common uncertainty quantification techniques are not well-suited for modern deep neural networks. The paper proposes using conformal prediction, which provides prediction intervals that come with a probabilistic coverage guarantee for new samples. A key challenge is that bounding box predictions are conditioned on the object class, so errors in predicted class labels can undermine the coverage guarantee.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper develops a two-step conformal approach to generate prediction intervals for object bounding boxes with the desired coverage guarantees. First, they generate a conformal set of predicted class labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. Then they select a bounding box quantile based on this label set to construct guaranteed prediction intervals for the bounding box coordinates. To ensure useful uncertainties, they propose novel ensemble and quantile regression methods so intervals adapt based on object size. They also handle multiple testing issues and guarantee coverage conditional on object class.

Main Contributions:
1) A novel two-step framework to propagate classification uncertainty into bounding box prediction intervals with validity guarantees.
2) New conformal prediction adaptations using ensembling and quantile regression to provide adaptive intervals based on object size.  
3) Demonstrating the first conformal approach for multi-class object detection providing class-conditional coverage guarantees.
4) Empirical demonstration on real datasets showing tight prediction intervals that satisfy the desired coverage across classes and object sizes.

The key novelty is the two-step approach broadening conformal guarantees to misclassified objects. The paper makes conformal prediction applicable to multi-class detection with practical and reliable uncertainty estimates.
