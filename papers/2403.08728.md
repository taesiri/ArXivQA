# [Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling: Solving Inverse Problems with   Diffusion Models trained on Corrupted Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many applications such as MRI have limited access to clean data due to cost, privacy, or physical constraints. However, it is still desirable to train high-quality generative models that can be used as priors to solve inverse problems in the data domain, even in regimes not seen during training. Prior works have studied training models on corrupted data, but not for solving out-of-distribution tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a method to leverage diffusion models trained on linearly corrupted data as priors for solving inverse problems with potentially different corruption at test time. 

Key Ideas:
- Extend concept of Ambient Diffusion models trained on corrupted data to the setting of MRI with multi-coil Fourier measurements. Show theoretically that these models still estimate the underlying clean distribution.
- Derive an Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling algorithm akin to standard DPS that uses Ambient Diffusion models to approximately sample the posterior for out-of-distribution tasks.
- Evaluate A-DPS on image inpainting models for tasks like compressed sensing and super-resolution. Surprisingly, models trained with corruption can outperform clean models. 
- Train Ambient Diffusion models directly on Fourier undersampled multi-coil MRI data. Show they are useful for accelerated MRI reconstruction, especially at high accelerations not seen during training.

Main Contributions:
1) A framework to unlock corruption-trained diffusion models for general inverse problems via Ambient DPS.
2) Empirical evidence that models trained with corruption can exceed clean model performance.
3) An extension of Ambient Diffusion to the multi-coil MRI setting with theoretical justification. 
4) State-of-the-art accelerated MRI reconstruction with Ambient Diffusion models trained directly on undersampled data.

The key insight is that corruption-based training acts as an implicit regularizer that makes diffusion models useful for out-of-distribution tasks in a way not achieved by models trained on clean data.
