# [Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling: Solving Inverse Problems with   Diffusion Models trained on Corrupted Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many applications such as MRI have limited access to clean data due to cost, privacy, or physical constraints. However, it is still desirable to train high-quality generative models that can be used as priors to solve inverse problems in the data domain, even in regimes not seen during training. Prior works have studied training models on corrupted data, but not for solving out-of-distribution tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a method to leverage diffusion models trained on linearly corrupted data as priors for solving inverse problems with potentially different corruption at test time. 

Key Ideas:
- Extend concept of Ambient Diffusion models trained on corrupted data to the setting of MRI with multi-coil Fourier measurements. Show theoretically that these models still estimate the underlying clean distribution.
- Derive an Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling algorithm akin to standard DPS that uses Ambient Diffusion models to approximately sample the posterior for out-of-distribution tasks.
- Evaluate A-DPS on image inpainting models for tasks like compressed sensing and super-resolution. Surprisingly, models trained with corruption can outperform clean models. 
- Train Ambient Diffusion models directly on Fourier undersampled multi-coil MRI data. Show they are useful for accelerated MRI reconstruction, especially at high accelerations not seen during training.

Main Contributions:
1) A framework to unlock corruption-trained diffusion models for general inverse problems via Ambient DPS.
2) Empirical evidence that models trained with corruption can exceed clean model performance.
3) An extension of Ambient Diffusion to the multi-coil MRI setting with theoretical justification. 
4) State-of-the-art accelerated MRI reconstruction with Ambient Diffusion models trained directly on undersampled data.

The key insight is that corruption-based training acts as an implicit regularizer that makes diffusion models useful for out-of-distribution tasks in a way not achieved by models trained on clean data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework called Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling that uses diffusion models trained on linearly corrupted data as priors to solve inverse problems with different corruption types at test time, demonstrating strong performance on image restoration tasks and accelerated MRI reconstruction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a framework called "Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling" (A-DPS) for solving inverse problems with diffusion models learned from linearly corrupted data. Specifically, it shows how models trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) can be used as priors to solve inverse problems with different forward processes (e.g. image blurring).

2) It demonstrates the efficacy of A-DPS on standard image datasets like CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ. It shows that diffusion models trained on corrupted data can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for tasks like compressed sensing and super-resolution, especially in high corruption regimes. 

3) It extends the Ambient Diffusion framework to train MRI models directly from Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at various acceleration factors. It again observes that models trained on highly subsampled data serve as better priors compared to models trained on fully sampled data when solving inverse problems at high acceleration factors.

4) It open-sources code and trained models to help accelerate research in this direction. Specifically, it releases pre-trained Ambient Diffusion MRI models for brain MRI reconstruction.

In summary, the main contribution is a framework to unlock the potential of diffusion models trained on corrupted data to solve inverse problems, even those with different forward processes than seen during training. This is demonstrated through strong results on image datasets and MRI reconstruction tasks.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS): The proposed method to use diffusion models trained on linearly corrupted data to perform posterior sampling and solve inverse problems with different forward processes.

- Ambient Diffusion: A framework to train diffusion generative models on corrupted training data, estimating the "ambient score". 

- Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS): An algorithm to approximately sample from posteriors using diffusion models by incorporating a measurements likelihood term.

- Multi-coil MRI: The paper focuses specifically on using Ambient Diffusion models for multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging, where multiple receiver coils acquire Fourier samples of the image.

- Subsampled training data: The paper trains models directly on retrospective undersampled MRI data at various acceleration factors.

- Linear corruption: The paper considers corruption of training data by linear forward operators, such as random inpainting or MRI undersampling.

- Inverse problems: Using the trained Ambient Diffusion models to solve image reconstruction inverse problems at test time, such as compressed sensing or super-resolution.

- Acceleration factor: In MRI, the undersampling ratio compared to a fully-sampled acquisition.

So in summary, key terms cover Ambient Diffusion, posterior sampling with diffusion models, multi-coil MRI reconstruction, training on corrupted data, and solving inverse problems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that Ambient Diffusion models trained on corrupted data can outperform models trained on clean data for solving inverse problems, which is counterintuitive. What aspects of the Ambient Diffusion framework enable this surprising result? 

2. The proposed Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS) method adapts standard Diffusion Posterior Sampling to use Ambient Diffusion models. What are the key modifications made to the DPS algorithm and how do they account for using a model trained on corrupted data?

3. For the MRI application, the paper proves a theorem that the Ambient Diffusion objective will learn the optimal conditional mean estimator. How does the proof differ from the original Ambient Diffusion paper and what extra conditions need to be satisfied for the MRI setting?

4. The MRI experiments train separate Ambient Diffusion models for different undersampling rates. Could a single Ambient Diffusion model be trained across multiple undersampling rates? What challenges would this introduce?

5. The proposed approach aggregates multi-coil measurements through a simple adjoint operation. The paper mentions more complex aggregation schemes could improve performance. What are some alternatives and what would be the trade-offs?  

6. What forms of structured corruption could the proposed approach be applied to beyond random erasures or Fourier undersampling? What new mathematical results would need to be derived?

7. For what types of likelihood functions and inverse problems might the Ambient DPS approximation perform poorly compared to more complex posterior sampling algorithms?

8. The Ambient Diffusion models for natural images were pre-trained, but the MRI models were trained from scratch. How big of an impact could pre-training an MRI model on natural images have?

9. The experiments focus on T2 brain MRI scans. Would the conclusions generalize to other MRI scan types and anatomical regions? What differences may emerge?

10. The paper hypothesizes there could be a theoretical understanding for why Ambient models outperform clean models on some tasks. What aspects would such a theory need to explain about corrupted data learning?
