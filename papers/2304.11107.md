# ChatABL: Abductive Learning via Natural Language Interaction with
  ChatGPT

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is how to integrate the capabilities of perception, language understanding, and reasoning in a more user-friendly and natural manner by combining large language models (LLMs) with abductive learning. Specifically, the paper proposes a new framework called ChatABL that leverages the strengths of LLMs and abductive learning to bridge perception, language, and reasoning abilities. The key challenges the paper tries to tackle are:1. How to make effective use of limited labeled data (small sample learning) for a complex perception task like deciphering handwritten equations.2. How to perform logical reasoning and discover unknown rules from limited clues and examples. 3. How to combine perceptual information from images with symbolic knowledge rules in an interpretable way.To address these challenges, ChatABL utilizes LLMs' natural language processing capabilities to provide reasoning explanations, constrain and correct the perceptual model's understanding, and jointly optimize perception and reasoning in an iterative process. The central hypothesis is that by interacting with LLMs in natural language, the model can complete complex reasoning tasks with small training data and incomplete knowledge, in a way that is more consistent with human cognition. The paper demonstrates this through experiments on a handwritten equation decipherment task and shows ChatABL's superior reasoning ability over other methods.In summary, the core research question is how to integrate perception, language, and reasoning via natural interaction with large language models, to enable human-like reasoning and small sample learning. The paper proposes ChatABL as a new framework to validate this hypothesis.
