# [Train/Test-Time Adaptation with Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14333)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt pre-trained models both at train and test time by retrieving relevant information from a large unlabeled external dataset. Specifically, the paper proposes the Train/Test-Time Adaptation with Retrieval (T3AR) method to:

- Improve model adaptation at train time by incorporating retrieved samples from an external dataset into a contrastive self-supervised objective along with the downstream labeled data. 

- Enable test-time adaptation by selecting relevant samples from an external dataset to better approximate the target data distribution, without needing the original training data.

The key hypothesis is that retrieving and aggregating relevant samples from a large heterogeneous external dataset can significantly improve model adaptation, especially when the amount of adaptation data is limited. The paper shows this allows T3AR to outperform standard fine-tuning and existing test-time adaptation methods.

In summary, the central research question is how to leverage retrieval from a large external dataset to improve model adaptation at both train and test time, especially in low-data regimes. The key hypothesis is that intelligent retrieval and aggregation of external data can compensate for limited target data during adaptation.
