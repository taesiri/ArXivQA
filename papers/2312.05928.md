# [AesFA: An Aesthetic Feature-Aware Arbitrary Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05928)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing neural style transfer (NST) methods struggle to effectively transfer aesthetic styles from reference images, leading to unsatisfying stylizations. This is largely due to two issues: (1) They rely solely on summary statistics without considering spatial information, failing to capture distinct local styles. (2) They depend heavily on pretrained models like VGG during inference, limiting efficiency and use for high-resolution images.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes AesFA, an aesthetic feature-aware arbitrary NST model that is lightweight yet effective. The key ideas are:

(1) Decompose images into high- and low-frequencies using Octave Convolutions to better disentangle aesthetic features like textures and tones. This improves style transfer quality without complex algorithms like FFT.  

(2) Introduce a new stylization module called Adaptive Octave Convolution (AdaOct) to infuse decomposed content features with predicted aesthetic-aware kernels/biases for superior stylization.

(3) Propose an efficient contrastive loss for aesthetic features using nearest negative mining. This trains encoders to extract delicate styles without relying on VGG at inference.

Main Contributions:

(1) An end-to-end model for aesthetic feature-aware NST that maintains spatial styles and leverages frequency decomposition for better feature disentanglement and efficiency.

(2) A new AdaOct module to effectively blend frequency-decomposed content features with aesthetic styles using predicted convolution kernels/biases.

(3) An improved contrastive loss for extracting aesthetic features without expensive pretrained models at inference.

Experiments show AesFA outperforms state-of-the-art NST techniques across resolutions in quality and efficiency. It stylizes high-res images in 0.02s and generalizes well from 256px to 4K images. Ablations also demonstrate the efficacy of each model component.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes AesFA, a lightweight and effective neural style transfer model that decomposes images by frequency to better disentangle aesthetic features, uses a new stylization module and contrastive loss to enhance stylization quality, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across spatial resolutions while being efficient enough for real-time ultra high-resolution rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a lightweight yet effective model called AesFA (Aesthetic Feature-Aware Arbitrary Neural Style Transfer) for neural style transfer that maintains spatial style information and decomposes images by frequency to improve feature extraction, enhancing stylization quality and computational efficiency. 

2. Introducing a new stylization module called Adaptive Octave Convolution (AdaOct) that combines frequency-decomposed content features with predicted aesthetic feature-aware kernels and biases to yield more satisfying stylizations with sophisticated aesthetic characteristics. 

3. Proposing a straightforward contrastive learning method for aesthetic features to further accelerate the network's capability to extract more distinct aesthetic representations.

4. Showing that AesFA achieves generalization, quality and efficiency simultaneously across various spatial resolutions through comprehensive comparisons with several state-of-the-art neural style transfer methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective and efficient neural style transfer model called AesFA that decomposes images by frequency to better capture aesthetic features, along with associated techniques to further improve stylization quality.

The paper proposes a new NST method called "AesFA" which aims to effectively transfer aesthetic styles from art images to content images. It uses frequency decomposition via OctConv to better disentangle aesthetic features. The AdaOct module adaptively stylizes frequency-decomposed content features. A contrastive loss is also introduced to better learn aesthetic representations. Experiments show AesFA produces higher quality stylizations compared to recent NST techniques, especially for high resolution images, while also being efficient.
