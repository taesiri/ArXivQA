# [Origami: (un)folding the abstraction of recursion schemes for program   synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13828)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Program synthesis aims to automatically generate computer programs from a high-level specification. A major challenge is effectively handling loops and recursion to avoid non-terminating programs.
- Using common programming patterns like recursion schemes can help constrain the search space and simplify program synthesis.

Proposed Solution - Origami:
- Decompose program synthesis into smaller steps by first picking a recursion scheme, then picking a base data type, then filling in a template.
- Manual inspection of solutions to the GPSB benchmark problems using recursion schemes showed most solutions follow folding, unfolding, or compositions. 
- Once the recursion scheme is chosen, synthesizing the missing parts of the template is simpler due to input/output type constraints.

Recursion Scheme Templates:
- Catamorphism (folding): Common for reducing structure to value. Templates handle mapping, generating functions, and combining patterns.
- Anamorphism (unfolding): Starts from seed value and unfolds into structure. Template requires evolving element generator, next seed generator, and stop condition predicate.  
- Hylomorphism: Combination of catamorphism and anamorphism templates.
- Accumorphism: Allows access to partial results during recursion. Useful for indexing or combining catamorphisms.  

Contributions:
- Analysis of GPSB benchmark problems solved manually using recursion schemes. Most fit folding, unfolding or compositions. 
- Origami approach to break down synthesis by first picking recursion scheme and data type, then filling in template. Constrains search space.
- Outline of catamorphism, anamorphism, hylomorphism and accumorphism templates showing which parts must be evolved.
- Proof-of-concept experiments showing improved success rate on a subset of GPSB problems by fixing the catamorphism template.
