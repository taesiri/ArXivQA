# [Origami: (un)folding the abstraction of recursion schemes for program   synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13828)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Program synthesis aims to automatically generate computer programs from a high-level specification. A major challenge is effectively handling loops and recursion to avoid non-terminating programs.
- Using common programming patterns like recursion schemes can help constrain the search space and simplify program synthesis.

Proposed Solution - Origami:
- Decompose program synthesis into smaller steps by first picking a recursion scheme, then picking a base data type, then filling in a template.
- Manual inspection of solutions to the GPSB benchmark problems using recursion schemes showed most solutions follow folding, unfolding, or compositions. 
- Once the recursion scheme is chosen, synthesizing the missing parts of the template is simpler due to input/output type constraints.

Recursion Scheme Templates:
- Catamorphism (folding): Common for reducing structure to value. Templates handle mapping, generating functions, and combining patterns.
- Anamorphism (unfolding): Starts from seed value and unfolds into structure. Template requires evolving element generator, next seed generator, and stop condition predicate.  
- Hylomorphism: Combination of catamorphism and anamorphism templates.
- Accumorphism: Allows access to partial results during recursion. Useful for indexing or combining catamorphisms.  

Contributions:
- Analysis of GPSB benchmark problems solved manually using recursion schemes. Most fit folding, unfolding or compositions. 
- Origami approach to break down synthesis by first picking recursion scheme and data type, then filling in template. Constrains search space.
- Outline of catamorphism, anamorphism, hylomorphism and accumorphism templates showing which parts must be evolved.
- Proof-of-concept experiments showing improved success rate on a subset of GPSB problems by fixing the catamorphism template.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Origami, a program synthesis approach that uses recursion schemes to constrain the search space by first determining the unfolding/folding pattern and then evolving the missing parts of the corresponding template.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of recursion schemes to simplify and constrain the search space in program synthesis. Specifically, the authors:

- Manually solved benchmark problems using recursion schemes to identify common templates and patterns. They found catamorphism and accumorphism covered over 60% of the solutions.

- Proposed Origami, an approach to program synthesis that first picks a recursion scheme, then picks a data type, generates a template, and evolves the missing parts using genetic programming. This constrains the search space and simplifies evolution.

- Showed preliminary results on a subset of benchmarks by adapting an existing GP system to use catamorphism templates. This improved success rates compared to the baseline, obtaining the best results on 6 out of 7 solvable problems.

- Analyzed the minimal function set required to solve the benchmark problems using recursion schemes and provided guidance on how to pick schemes based on type signatures.

In summary, the main contribution is using recursion schemes to guide and simplify program synthesis, as evidenced by improved empirical results and analysis of benchmark solutions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Recursion schemes - The paper focuses on using recursion schemes, specifically catamorphisms (folds), anamorphisms (unfolds), and hylomorphisms, as program templates to simplify program synthesis.

- Program synthesis - The overall goal is to automatically generate computer programs using genetic programming/inductive program synthesis. The paper explores using recursion schemes to constrain the search space.

- Genetic programming - The paper proposes Origami, a genetic programming approach that first picks a recursion scheme and then evolves the necessary template functions.

- Fold/unfold templates - The recursion scheme templates have evolvable parts that need to be filled in, like folds and unfolds over data structures. The paper manually solves GPSB problems with these.

- Type signatures - The input and output types of functions can guide choosing recursion schemes and further constrain evolvable parts of templates.

- Constraining search space - A key benefit of the recursion scheme templates is reducing the search space for program synthesis by fixing parts of the program structure.

So in summary - recursion schemes, program synthesis, genetic programming, fold/unfold templates, type information, search space reduction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes breaking down program synthesis into smaller steps, including choosing a recursion scheme and then choosing a template. What are some of the challenges or open questions around automating the choice of recursion scheme and template? How could this choice be encoded into the search itself?

2. The paper highlights that once the recursion scheme is fixed, the synthesis problem becomes simpler as each missing part is constrained by the input/output types. Can you elaborate on how the type information constrains the search space and provides an example of this constraint in action? 

3. The paper introduces the idea of "evolvable functions" for different recursion scheme templates. Can you explain the role of these evolvable functions in more detail? What makes them well-suited for search-based program synthesis?

4. Table 1 shows a mapping between type signatures and recursion schemes. What is the intuition behind these mappings? Are there some cases or caveats where this mapping would not work or be ambiguous?  

5. For the anamorphism template, the paper states three evolvable components must be synthesized. How could the interdependency between these components be handled? What co-evolution or divide-and-conquer techniques could help here?

6. The results show improved performance over baselines when fixing the catamorphism template. To what extent could this improvement be attributed to constraining the search space versus capturing common programming idioms? 

7. The function set in Table 2 is assumed to be provided by the user. How sensitive is the performance of the approach to this function set? Could it be learned or expanded automatically?

8. What other recursion schemes beyond the ones explored could be useful templates for program synthesis? What kinds of problems would they be suited for?

9. The paper focuses on a specific benchmark suite. How could the Origami approach be generalized or scaled up to larger, more complex programming problems? What adaptations would be needed?

10. The idea of restricting search using templates is common in machine learning. Could ideas from areas like neural architecture search also apply to or cross-pollinate ideas in constrained program synthesis?
