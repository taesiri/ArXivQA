# [STAIR: Spatial-Temporal Reasoning with Auditable Intermediate Results   for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most video question answering (QA) models do not perform well on questions that require complex temporal reasoning, especially on long and informative videos. Their performance tends to drop when answering questions that need to determine the order of events or identify events within a time period. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes STAIR, a neural module network for video QA that decomposes questions into sub-tasks and solves them with specifically designed neural modules. 

Key ideas of STAIR:

1) A program generator converts a question into a program composed of nested module functions. This program represents the reasoning steps.

2) A set of lightweight neural modules are designed to perform basic video-text sub-tasks like localizing actions in time, recognizing objects in clips, etc. Modules provide intermediate outputs instead of attention maps to increase explainability.

3) Intermediate supervision trains modules end-to-end with ground truth answers of sub-tasks, improving intermediate output accuracy.  

4) Modules can be combined dynamically into a module network according to the generated program. The network processes encoded video/text features and outputs an answer representation.

Main Contributions:

- Defines basic video-text sub-tasks and lightweight neural modules to perform them for the video QA task.

- Achieves strong performance on the AGQA benchmark, outperforming previous methods on complex questions requiring temporal reasoning. 

- Provides interpretability by returning human-readable intermediate outputs at each reasoning step. These can also help improve pre-trained QA models.

- Shows the feasibility of applying the approach to datasets without human-annotated programs, demonstrating wider applicability.

In summary, STAIR advances the state-of-the-art in explainable and interpretable video QA, specifically for complex questions needing temporal reasoning on long, real-world videos. The modular architecture and intermediate outputs are the main innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes STAIR, a video question answering model based on neural module networks that excels at spatial-temporal reasoning through decomposing questions into sub-tasks and providing auditable intermediate results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work include:

1. Proposing STAIR, a video question answering model based on neural module networks, which excels at solving questions that require combinational temporal and logical reasoning and is highly interpretable. The authors define sub-tasks for video QA, and design neural modules to complete these sub-tasks.

2. Introducing intermediate supervision to make the intermediate results of the neural modules more accurate. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on several video question answering tasks to demonstrate STAIR's performance, explainability, possibility to collaborate with pre-trained models, and applicability when program annotations are not available. 

4. Making STAIR more auditable by returning direct, human-understandable intermediate results for almost every reasoning step. These intermediate results can also serve as prompts to improve the performance of pre-trained models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the STAIR model and methodology for explainable and compositional video question answering, with a focus on temporal reasoning, along with empirical demonstrations of its capabilities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. You defined 16 neural modules for different sub-tasks in video QA. What were your principles when determining what modules to include? How did you decide on the granularity of the modules (i.e., not having too few or too many)?

2. The intermediate outputs of the modules make your model more interpretable. How do you balance interpretability and performance when designing the modules? Do more complex modules lead to better performance at the expense of interpretability? 

3. You used intermediate supervision to make the outputs of intermediate modules more accurate. How much does this intermediate supervision help? Have you experimented with removing it? Does it negatively impact final performance?

4. You combined STAIR with GPT-2 by providing module outputs as prompts. What challenges did you face when integrating neural modules with large pre-trained LMs? Did you have to modify or simplify the modules?  

5. Have you explored other ways STAIR could incorporate or collaborate with large pre-trained LMs beyond providing prompts? E.g. using them directly as modules or integrating their representations.

6. You designed the modules specifically for video QA. Do you think they could be reused for other video-and-language tasks like video captioning? Would it require changing the modules or just the method of combining them?

7. You trained the program generator on AGQA question-program pairs. How does its performance change when tested on other datasets like STAR? Are the generated programs less accurate?

8. What are the limitations of relying on a program generator at inference time? Could incorrect programs lead to unpredictable behavior? How could this issue be addressed?  

9. The AGQA dataset provides scene graph annotations. Have you considered incorporating scene graphs more tightly into STAIR instead of just using them to supervise modules? If not, why?

10. Neural module networks require many design choices - defining sub-tasks, creating modules, architecture of program generator, etc. What parts of STAIR were most important to get right? What future work could further improve the framework?
