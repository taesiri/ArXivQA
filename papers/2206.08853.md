# MineDojo: Building Open-Ended Embodied Agents with Internet-Scale   Knowledge

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop autonomous embodied agents that can attain human-level performance across a wide spectrum of diverse, open-ended tasks?The key hypothesis is that three main ingredients are necessary to enable the emergence of generalist embodied agents:1) An environment that supports a multitude of open-ended goals and tasks.2) A large-scale database of prior multimodal knowledge to facilitate learning. 3) A flexible and scalable agent architecture that can effectively leverage this knowledge.To address this research question, the paper introduces MineDojo, a framework built in Minecraft that provides:1) A simulation platform and benchmark suite with thousands of diverse, open-ended tasks.2) An internet-scale, multimodal knowledge base of gameplay videos, wiki pages, forum posts, etc.  3) A novel agent learning algorithm that leverages large pre-trained video-language models as open-vocabulary, multi-task reward functions.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the combination of open-ended environments, internet-scale domain knowledge, and scalable agent architectures with large-scale pre-training will enable progress towards generally capable embodied agents. The MineDojo framework aims to facilitate research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing MineDojo, a new framework built on Minecraft to help develop open-ended, generally capable agents. MineDojo provides:- A simulator with thousands of diverse, open-ended tasks specified in natural language prompts. This is much larger than prior Minecraft benchmarks.- An internet-scale, multimodal knowledge base of YouTube videos, Wiki pages, and Reddit posts that captures gameplay wisdom from millions of Minecraft players. 2. Proposing a novel algorithm that leverages the YouTube video dataset to train MineCLIP, a video-language contrastive model. MineCLIP provides open-vocabulary, multi-task rewards to train a reinforcement learning agent without manual reward engineering.3. Demonstrating an agent that can solve a variety of creative and programmatic MineDojo tasks using only the learned MineCLIP rewards. The agent is competitive with hand-engineered dense rewards in several cases.4. Introducing a metric to automatically evaluate creative tasks using MineCLIP. The metric agrees well with human judgment on the subset of tasks tested.5. Open-sourcing the simulator, datasets, algorithms, and pre-trained models to facilitate research into open-ended agent learning.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the MineDojo framework with task suite, knowledge base, and learning algorithm as a unified platform to make progress on developing generally capable embodied agents. The introduction of internet-scale pre-training is a key novelty.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new framework called MineDojo built on Minecraft to help develop generalist embodied AI agents, featuring a large benchmark of diverse open-ended tasks and an internet-scale knowledge base of gameplay videos, wiki pages, and forum discussions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper introduces a new framework called MineDojo for developing generally capable embodied agents in an open-ended environment. Other related works have proposed various environments and platforms for open-ended learning, but MineDojo's use of Minecraft and focus on leveraging large-scale internet knowledge makes it unique.- A key contribution is the large and diverse benchmark task suite with thousands of natural language prompted tasks. This is much bigger than prior Minecraft benchmarks like MineRL. The creative tasks with freeform objectives are especially novel.- The paper collects an impressive internet-scale multimodal knowledge base of gameplay videos, tutorials, wiki pages, etc. This differentiates from prior works that typically use human demonstrations or simulations alone. Leveraging collective online wisdom is an interesting direction.- The proposed MineCLIP algorithm demonstrates how large pretrained video-language models can enable multi-task RL training with an open-vocabulary reward function. This is inline with trends in NLP and robotics to utilize foundation models. The idea of self-supervision from gameplay videos is novel.- For evaluation, the paper introduces learned metrics based on MineCLIP in lieu of human scores. Automated evaluation for open-ended creativity is an open challenge that this work starts tackling.Overall, the paper makes excellent contributions in terms of the simulator, benchmark tasks, knowledge database, and learning algorithms. The overarching goal of achieving generally capable agents in open worlds is highly ambitious and aligns with AI's long-term aspirations. This paper offers a strong foundation for the community to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest include:- Developing new algorithms and advancing open-ended learning using the MineDojo framework. They have open-sourced MineDojo to serve as a testbed for the community to make progress on building generally capable embodied agents. There are many possibilities to leverage the task suites, knowledge bases, and starter code they provide.- Exploring ways to more directly learn policies and skills from the in-the-wild YouTube videos, such as using learning from observation techniques. The authors point out that their dataset lacks action labels, which poses challenges for imitation learning. Inferring behaviors and skills directly from the human gameplay videos could be a complementary direction to their reward learning approach.- Applying state-of-the-art document understanding techniques like LayoutLM and DocFormer to extract actionable knowledge from the unstructured wiki pages. The wiki data contains multimodal tutorials, recipes, diagrams, etc. that could inform planning methods if properly parsed.- Using the Reddit data to finetune large language models to generate better instructions and plans that are grounded in the Minecraft domain. The authors suggest the recent advances like SayCan and Socratic Models that leverage internet text data are promising for future research on Reddit.- Exploring image synthesis with the data, especially creative tasks like "build a house" where the end result is a novel image. - Incorporating hierarchical planning and model-based reinforcement learning methods to handle the long-horizon complex tasks.- Scaling up the current MineCLIP framework with more data, model parameters, and compute for improved performance.In summary, the key directions are developing new algorithms tailored to MineDojo's resources, using the internet data for imitation learning and instruction generation, leveraging the wiki data, and scaling up the existing methods. The authors frame MineDojo as a platform for advancing open-ended learning.
