# [Unsupervised Sign Language Translation and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sign language translation and generation (SLTG) is important for facilitating communication between deaf and hearing communities. However, training SLTG models requires large parallel video-text datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain.  
- Existing SLTG methods rely on supervised learning, lacking the ability to leverage abundant non-parallel sign language data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an unsupervised sign language translation and generation network (USLNet) that can learn from non-parallel data.
- USLNet has 4 key modules:
   1) Text reconstruction module to learn text representations
   2) Video reconstruction module to learn video representations 
   3) Text-video-text backtranslation to translate text->pseudo video->text
   4) Video-text-video backtranslation to translate video->pseudo text->video
- A sliding window aligner is used to address cross-modality sequence length and dimensionality differences.

Main Contributions:
- USLNet is the first completely unsupervised approach for sign language translation and generation, removing the need for expensive parallel corpora.
- It is an end-to-end model capable of both translation and generation in a unified architecture.
- Experiments on BOBSL and OpenASL datasets show USLNet achieves competitive performance to supervised baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- Analysis provides insights into the model components and areas for further enhancement.

In summary, the paper explores an unsupervised learning direction to alleviate data scarcity issues in SLTG, proposing the pioneering USLNet model that shows promising results on benchmark datasets.
