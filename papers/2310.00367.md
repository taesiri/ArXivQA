# [AutomaTikZ: Text-Guided Synthesis of Scientific Vector Graphics with   TikZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00367)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. Can language models capture the nuances of the TikZ graphics language and generate high-quality scientific figures based solely on textual image captions? 2. Will augmenting LLaMA with multimodal CLIP embeddings (the proposed CLIMA model) improve the textual alignment and overall quality of generated TikZ figures compared to vanilla LLaMA?3. How do fine-tuned models like LLaMA and CLIMA compare to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude when generating scientific TikZ figures from captions?4. Are the fine-tuned models prone to memorization and verbatim copying of captions like GPT-4 and Claude? Or do they generalize better and produce more novel outputs?5. Can conditioning on reference images, instead of just captions, further boost the performance of CLIMA in generating high-quality TikZ figures that closely match human references?In summary, the key goals are assessing whether LLMs can effectively generate TikZ graphics from text, comparing fine-tuned vs general LLMs, evaluating the impact of multimodal conditioning, and analyzing memorization and generalization. The overall aim is developing models that can automatically produce high-quality vector graphics figures from captions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a system called AutomaTikZ for automatically generating TikZ drawings from natural language descriptions. The key points are:- They created a new dataset called TikZ-Captions with around 120k paired TikZ drawings and captions. This is the first large-scale dataset of TikZ graphics.- They fine-tuned the LLM LaMDA on this dataset and showed it can generate more human-like scientific figures compared to GPT-4 and Claude when evaluated automatically and by human annotators. - They proposed a new model called CLIMA which combines LaMDA with CLIP embeddings to better capture the visual concepts in captions. CLIMA outperformed LaMDA alone on several metrics.- They demonstrated that all the models exhibit low memorization and generate novel outputs, unlike GPT-4 and Claude which tend to copy captions more. - They introduced techniques like data augmentation of captions using LLMs and iterative resampling during inference to handle errors and improve results.Overall, the main contribution is developing the first dedicated system for generating TikZ graphics from natural language by leveraging advances in large language models. The new dataset, proposed techniques, and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for producing high-quality vector graphics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset and model for generating scientific vector graphics in TikZ based on natural language captions, demonstrating superior performance over GPT-4 and Claude through automatic metrics and human evaluation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in automated scientific figure generation:- This paper focuses specifically on generating figures in TikZ, a TeX-based vector graphics language. Most prior work has focused on generating raster images or lower-level vector graphics primitives like SVG. Using TikZ as an intermediate representation is a novel approach that provides a higher-level abstraction.- The proposed dataset of 120k+ aligned TikZ drawings and captions seems to be the largest of its kind for this task. Many previous datasets in this field have been smaller or synthetic. The diversity of data sources is also impressive.- The models benchmarked are state-of-the-art large language models like LLama and Claude. Prior work has mostly evaluated smaller task-specific models. Comparing the capabilities of general-purpose LLMs on this task is a valuable contribution.- Both automatic metrics and human evaluations are used to assess the models. The human evals based on best-worst scaling provide nuanced insights into the model performance. Many prior papers have relied solely on automatic metrics.- Analyzing issues like memorization and complexity of generated outputs adds useful color about model behaviors. The code and image novelty measurements are fairly novel.- The proposed CLIMA model appears to advance the state-of-the-art by integrating visual information via CLIP. Multimodal representations have shown promise for text-to-image tasks.Overall, I would say this paper pushes the boundaries on dataset scale, model capabilities, evaluation rigor, and analysis depth compared to related work. The innovations in data representation, model architecture, and human annotation design are noteworthy. If the introduced models, data, and analysis techniques are made publicly available, this could become an influential paper in this niche research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Incorporating insights from the caption generation community to enrich the input texts by adding other figure-mentioning sections from the source documents. This could provide more context and improve the quality of the generated figures.- Enhancing their dataset extraction pipeline, particularly for arXiv papers. They had to exclude over 120k TikZ images from arXiv that failed to compile, so improving the extraction process could allow them to utilize more training data. - Bridging the gap to human performance levels. The authors note there is still a difference between the figures generated by their models and human-created ones, so continuing to improve the models is an important direction.- Potentially using their approach for applications like vectorizing existing raster graphics or conditioning on hand-drawn sketches instead of just text captions. The multimodal capabilities of CLIMA could enable these new applications.- Investigating model memorization and copying issues more thoroughly to develop better techniques for promoting novelty and avoiding typographic attacks.- Exploring integration with other graphics languages besides TikZ, assessing the uniqueness of TikZ and whether their approach could work for other languages.- Experimenting with different model architectures, training techniques, and decoding algorithms to further boost performance.So in summary, the main future directions are improving the training data and extraction pipeline, bridging the human performance gap, exploring new applications, better handling memorization issues, generalizing across graphics languages, and refining the technical details of the models. The authors lay out a roadmap for building on their work to create even more capable systems.
