# [Interpretability in Symbolic Regression: a benchmark of Explanatory   Methods using the Feynman data set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Interpretability and explainability of machine learning models is an important area of research, especially for high-stakes applications like healthcare. Symbolic regression can potentially provide more interpretable models than blackbox methods, but evaluating and comparing the interpretability of different methods remains challenging due to the lack of rigorous definitions and evaluation procedures. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a benchmarking framework called iirsBenchmark to evaluate and compare the interpretability of symbolic regression and other regression methods using explanatory methods. The framework measures the quality and robustness of explanations on synthetic datasets generated from 100 physics equations from the Feynman benchmark. Two symbolic regression methods - Operon GP-NLS and ITEA along with 8 other regression methods ranging from linear models to neural networks are evaluated using 9 explanation methods like SHAP, Integrated Gradients etc. The quality of explanations is measured by cosine similarity and Normalized Mean Squared Error compared to ground truth explanations and robustness is measured by stability, infidelity and Jaccard stability to perturbations.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes a systematic benchmarking framework iirsBenchmark to evaluate interpretability using quality and robustness metrics of explanations

- Provides extensive comparative study of symbolic regression vs other regression methods paired with multiple explanation methods

- Finds symbolic regression can provide accurate and interpretable models comparable or better than blackboxes

- Shows Operon GP-NLS has better accuracy and smaller expression sizes than ITEA

- Finds SHAP and Integrated Gradients to be most robust explanation methods in general

- Shows explanation quality correlates strongly with model prediction accuracy 

- Framework and analysis provides ways to better validate and compare interpretability of predictive models

The paper makes a significant contribution towards better evaluation and validation of interpretability methods, especially for symbolic regression. The proposed benchmarking framework and analysis provides concrete ways to compare different regression methods paired with explanations. The findings also highlight the promise of using symbolic regression for accurate and interpretable predictive modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The iirsBenchmark, an open-source framework to measure explanations quality that unifies the interface of many popular explanatory methods.

2. The revision and proposal of measures to quantitatively evaluate the quality and robustness of explanations. 

3. A robust background to lay the groundwork of interpretability in the symbolic regression context.

4. An extensive comparative study of explanatory methods, using several regression methods including two hand-picked symbolic regression methods. 

The paper presents evidence that symbolic regression models can return accurate and interpretable models. The framework allows evaluating explanatory methods with special attention to symbolic regression. The authors expect this to help researchers evaluate, report and analyze explanatory methods, especially in the context of symbolic regression.
