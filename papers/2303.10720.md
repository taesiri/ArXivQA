# [Trainable Projected Gradient Method for Robust Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10720)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness/generalization of fine-tuned models, so they retain more of the generalization capability of the original pre-trained model?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Enforcing customized distance constraints between the fine-tuned model and pre-trained model for each layer will allow the model to retain more generalization capability from pre-training, leading to better OOD performance.

The paper proposes the trainable projected gradient method (TPGM) to automatically learn these per-layer distance constraints during fine-tuning to improve OOD robustness. The bi-level optimization formulation enables TPGM to balance fitting the training data and generalizing to new data when learning the projection ratios. Theoretically and empirically, TPGM is shown to learn differing constraints for each layer which helps improve OOD performance while maintaining ID accuracy.

So in summary, the central research question is how to improve OOD generalization during fine-tuning, with the key hypothesis being that optimized per-layer distance constraints can achieve this goal. TPGM is the proposed method to automatically learn these constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a trainable projected gradient method (TPGM) for robust fine-tuning of neural networks. Specifically:

- They formulate fine-tuning as a bi-level constrained optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the loss on the training data while constraining the distance between the fine-tuned model and pre-trained model. 

- They propose TPGM which learns a different projection constraint (distance to the pre-trained weights) for each layer of the network. The projection constraints are trainable parameters that are optimized using a validation set.

- This allows automatic learning of per-layer regularization strengths during fine-tuning. TPGM does not require expensive hyperparameter search across layers.

- Through experiments on image classification datasets using ResNet and Vision Transformer models, they demonstrate TPGM can improve out-of-distribution robustness while maintaining in-distribution accuracy.

- Analysis of the learned projection constraints shows lower layers require stronger regularization (closer to pre-trained weights), while higher layers need more flexibility. This matches the intuition that lower layers capture more general features.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a principled and automated way to learn per-layer regularization during fine-tuning through a trainable projected gradient approach. This improves model robustness without sacrificing accuracy or requiring extensive hyperparameter search.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a trainable projected gradient method (TPGM) to automatically learn per-layer distance constraints between a pre-trained model and a fine-tuned model in order to improve out-of-distribution robustness during fine-tuning while matching in-distribution accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes a new method called Trainable Projected Gradient Method (TPGM) for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained models. This approach is novel compared to prior works on fine-tuning, which often use manually designed heuristics or hyperparameter search to regularize model updates. TPGM learns regularization constraints automatically through a bi-level optimization framework.

- For improving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, the most related work is WISE (Wortsman et al. 2022). WISE showed impressive gains by interpolating between a fine-tuned model and pre-trained model using a single fixed ratio. However, TPGM outperforms WISE by learning per-layer interpolation ratios, allowing more flexibility. The experiments demonstrate TPGM's advantages.

- The paper connects to research on understanding why pretrained models generalize well, such as the role of feature reuse in transfer learning (Raghu et al. 2019). The analysis of the learned constraints provides insight into which layers require more or less regularization and correlates with findings that lower layers learn more general features.

- Compared to prior works on provable benefits of pretrained models like PRAD (Tripuraneni et al. 2020), this paper takes an empirical approach. The theoretical analysis aims to provide intuition rather than formal guarantees.

- For robustness to distribution shift, this paper is related to methods like domain generalization (Muandet et al. 2013) and domain adaptation (Wang et al. 2018). However, TPGM specifically focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained models, which is a distinct setting and technique.

In summary, TPGM introduces a new optimization-based perspective on regulating fine-tuning and achieves strong empirical results. The analysis provides useful insights into model adaptation. Overall, the work is a solid contribution to the growing literature on understanding and improving transfer learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to determine the optimal mixing ratio for interpolating between a pre-trained model and a fine-tuned model. The authors note that their proposed WISE method uses a fixed mixing ratio, and finding an adaptive way to determine this ratio could further improve performance.

- Extending the linear connectivity analysis to other model architectures beyond vision transformers, to see if similar gains can be achieved. The authors found vision transformers exhibit surprisingly good linear connectivity, enabling the gains from model interpolation.

- Exploring other ways to leverage linear connectivity and model interpolation to improve out-of-distribution generalization, beyond the specific WISE algorithm proposed in the paper.

- Testing the WISE approach on larger datasets and models to better understand its generalization capabilities. The paper focused on ImageNet and a ViT-B model.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why and when linear connectivity holds, and how it enables improved generalization through model interpolation.

- Exploring extensions of WISE for semi-supervised learning, where only a small labeled dataset is available for fine-tuning. The model interpolation approach may help prevent overfitting.

So in summary, some key directions are: optimizing the mixing ratio, extending to other architectures, developing new algorithms based on linear connectivity, scaling up the experiments, developing theory, and exploring semi-supervised learning settings. The authors pose these as open questions to guide future work in this space.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading, this paper proposes a new method called Trainable Projected Gradient Method (TPGM) for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained deep learning models. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate fine-tuning as a bi-level constrained optimization problem, where the inner level minimizes the training loss, and the outer level minimizes the validation loss under some distance constraint between the fine-tuned and pre-trained models. 

2) Use trainable projection radii as the distance constraints for each layer, and optimize them via alternating optimization - take gradient steps on model weights, then project weights to constraint set and optimize constraints on validation data.

3) Show both empirically and theoretically that this allows automatically learning a per-layer regularization that balances fitting the training data and preserving generalization of pre-trained features. Experiments on ResNet and Transformer models demonstrate improved out-of-distribution robustness.

In summary, TPGM provides an elegant framework to learn layer-wise inductive biases for robust fine-tuning, avoiding expensive hyperparameter search through bilevel optimization. Theoretical analysis offers insight into how it retains generalization of pre-trained models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a trainable projected gradient method (TPGM) for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained models. Fine-tuning often results in reduced performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data as the model overfits to the new training data. TPGM aims to preserve the generalization capability of the pre-trained model during fine-tuning by learning a different distance constraint for each layer of the network. Specifically, TPGM maintains trainable weight projection radii between the pre-trained and fine-tuned models for each layer. These radii act as constraints to control the amount of change allowed during fine-tuning. The radii are optimized through a bi-level formulation that alternates between updating the model weights normally and updating only the projection radii on a held-out validation set. 

Experiments on ImageNet and DomainNet benchmark datasets demonstrate that TPGM significantly improves OOD generalization ability over baseline fine-tuning and prior regularization techniques. Further analysis reveals intuitive patterns in the learned constraints, with lower layers requiring tighter regularization to preserve their more general features. A theoretical analysis helps explain why the bi-level optimization enables learning customized regularization per layer. Overall, TPGM provides an automated way to learn layer-wise inductive biases for robust fine-tuning without extensive hyperparameter search.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a trainable projected gradient method (TPGM) for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained models. TPGM learns a separate projection radius (distance constraint) for each layer of the neural network between the fine-tuned weights and pre-trained weights. Specifically, it alternates between an unconstrained gradient update on the training data, and optimizing the projection radii on a held-out validation set. After updating the radii, it projects the updated weights to be within the constraints. The bi-level optimization enables automatically learning a different regularization strength per layer to balance underfitting and overfitting. Empirically, TPGM is shown to improve out-of-distribution robustness across ResNet and Transformer architectures on DomainNet and ImageNet datasets, while matching or exceeding in-distribution accuracy compared to prior methods with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Theoretical analysis on linear models provides intuition on how the bi-level formulation enables learning layer-wise regularization.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key points of this paper are:

1. The paper aims to address the problem of preserving the generalization capability of pre-trained models when fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. Fine-tuning often leads to reduced out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness as the model overfits to the new data. 

2. The paper hypothesizes that the "forgetting" of generalization capability during fine-tuning is due to unconstrained optimization on the new data. It proposes to mitigate this issue by enforcing distance constraints between the fine-tuned model and pre-trained model.

3. Existing methods use manually designed heuristics or expensive hyperparameter search for setting the distance constraints. This does not scale well as the search space grows combinatorially with the number of layers. 

4. The paper proposes a trainable projected gradient method (TPGM) to automatically learn a separate distance constraint for each layer during fine-tuning. This allows optimizing the constraints efficiently without manual search.

5. TPGM poses fine-tuning as a bi-level constrained optimization problem. The constraints are learned by alternating between normal gradient updates and projecting the model within learned constraints.

6. Experiments on large datasets and models show TPGM matches or improves in-distribution accuracy while significantly boosting OOD robustness compared to existing methods.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and automatic way to learn per-layer distance constraints during fine-tuning to preserve generalization, instead of manual heuristic search. The bi-level formulation and theoretical analysis also provide insights into the behavior of TPGM.
