# [Conditional computation in neural networks: principles and research   trends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural networks have become very large and computationally expensive in the past years. Most NNs have fixed computational graphs that are not dynamically adapted to the current input. This is inefficient, since for different inputs, different network paths are optimal. In addition, fixed architectures also make NNs harder to transfer, specialize, and explain.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the concept of "modular" and "sparsely" activated neural networks. This refers to networks where the computational graph is dynamically adapted to the input via conditional computation. Three types of sparse modularity are discussed:

1) Dynamic input sparsity: Subsample and select the most useful input tokens to process. 

2) Dynamic width sparsity: Decompose layers into blocks (experts) and only activate useful blocks per input.

3) Dynamic depth sparsity: Dynamically skip layer execution if not needed for current input (as in early exit networks).

All three types can be seen as "discrete sampling" inside the network to pick components. A general formalism is provided based on Gumbel-Softmax sampling that unifies the three approaches.

Concrete techniques discussed:
1) Early exit networks: Classifiers are added inside the network; forward pass exits when model is confident. 
2) Mixture-of-expert (MoE) layers: A layer is divided into "experts" (subnetworks), only a few of which process each input.
3) Token selection: Individual input tokens can be subsampled (token dropping) or merged (token merging).

Key Contributions:
The paper:
1) Defines mathematically different types of dynamic sparse modularity via sampling inside networks.
2) Unifies notions of early exits and mixture of experts (MoEs) as sparse conditional computation. 
3) Discusses emerging benefits of sparse modular networks: efficiency, specialization, transferability, explainability.
4) Analyzes open problems, research directions and trends to design dynamically sparse neural networks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a general mathematical framework to describe various conditional computation techniques in neural networks. How does this framework allow categorizing techniques like mixture-of-experts, early exits, and token selection in a unified way? What are the limitations of this categorization?

3. Mixture-of-experts layers are gaining popularity in large language and vision models. What are some open challenges in designing the routing function? How to ensure expert specialization while avoiding instability or collapse during training? 

4. What are some emerging strategies to convert a pretrained model into its mixture-of-experts variant? How does moefication compare to training mixture-of-experts models from scratch? What efficiency and specialization benefits can be obtained?

5. Early exit networks aim to improve efficiency by dynamically activating only parts of a model. What architectural designs and training procedures can provide further acceleration especially during training? Are there any theoretical insights on the acceleration induced by early exits?

6. Token selection has been used successfully in vision transformers. What are some promising directions to apply similar dynamic input sparsity ideas in other domains like NLP or speech? What new token selection designs can be effective there?

7. What theoretical frameworks and benchmarks are required to properly evaluate and compare various conditional computation techniques especially regarding specialization, transferability and explainability?

8. Can conditional computation provide any benefits regarding robustness, uncertainty estimation or out-of-distribution detection in neural networks? What mechanisms can enable that?

9. The paper focuses on a specific set of conditional computation methods. What other types of neural network dynamismexist in the literature? How do they fit into the proposed general framework?

10. What are some promising applications of conditional computation in fields like drug discovery, automated scientific discovery or semantic communication networks? What types of efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs and transferability they require?
