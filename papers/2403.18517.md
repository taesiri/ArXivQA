## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Regularized low-rank approximation (LRA) models like sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) or sparse nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) are useful for interpretable dimensionality reduction. However, choosing appropriate regularizations and hyperparameters is challenging due to the multi-factor nature of these models. In addition, designing efficient optimization algorithms for non-Euclidean losses in regularized LRA has been underexplored.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper studies a general framework called Homogeneous Regularized Scale-Invariant (HRSI) problem which encompasses many regularized LRA models. It shows the scale-invariance in HRSI leads to an implicit regularization effect that provides insights on explicit regularization choices. 
- A generic Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve a range of regularized LRA problems with beta-divergence loss and convergence guarantees. An explicit balancing procedure is introduced in the algorithm to accelerate convergence.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates implicit regularization effects in regularized LRA due to scale-invariance, e.g. ridge regularization induces low-rank solutions. This guides regularization function selection.
- Proposes MM algorithm for efficient optimization of popular regularized LRA models like sparse NMF, ridge nonnegative CPD and sparse NTD. Allows non-Euclidean losses.
- Introduces computationally cheap explicit balancing of solutions to accelerate convergence, with formal proof of accelerated convergence on a toy problem.
- Showcases findings on synthetic and real datasets for sparse NMF, ridge CPD and sparse NTD. Observes increased speed and model interpretability.

In summary, the paper provides useful insights into regularization effects and efficient optimization for an important class of regularized low-rank approximation models, with demonstrations on key problems like sparse NMF and NTD. The explicit balancing strategy in particular helps accelerate convergence at little additional cost.
