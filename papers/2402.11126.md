# [Kolmogorov n-Widths for Multitask Physics-Informed Machine Learning   (PIML) Methods: Towards Robust Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods like physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are gaining popularity for solving PDEs. However, it remains difficult to analyze, benchmark and compare different PIML architectures. 
- Reporting performance on sampled tasks from a multitask PDE problem can be misleading due to overfitting and selective sampling biases. A more robust metric is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Use Kolmogorov n-widths, a measure of effectiveness of approximating functions, to evaluate multitask PIML architectures. 
- Propose a novel optimization procedure to compute the Kolmogorov n-width which requires tri-optimization between the model, reference solution and basis coefficients. 
- Apply Kolmogorov n-width in two ways: 
   1) As an analysis tool to benchmark models and compute lower accuracy bounds
   2) As a regularizer during training to improve generalization

Key Contributions:
- First methodology to compute Kolmogorov n-widths for multitask PIML models using a tri-optimization procedure
- Experimental study comparing different multitask PIML architectures using Kolmogorov n-widths 
- Analysis of how model choices (e.g. activation functions) affect ability to learn generalizable basis functions
- Introduction of Kolmogorov n-width as a regularization technique to reduce overfitting and improve generalization
- Provide a more robust and impartial metric for multitask PIML model evaluation and insights for improving architectures

In summary, the paper proposes using Kolmogorov n-widths, computed via a novel tri-optimization process, to evaluate and improve multitask PIML models. This enables more impartial comparison, insights and benchmarking than selective sampling of tasks.
