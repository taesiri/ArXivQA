## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel model called GAPS for solving geometry math problems. What are some of the key limitations of previous methods for solving geometry problems that GAPS aims to address?

2. One of the main components of GAPS is the geometry-specific program generator. Explain how it works to generate the solution program by separating the generation process for operators and operands. What is the advantage of this approach?

3. The paper proposes using a problem-type classifier in GAPS to handle different types of geometry problems with varying domain-specific languages (DSLs). How does this allow GAPS to use a single program generator for multiple problem types? What role does the mask generated by the classifier play?

4. Explain what a "cache token" is in GAPS and how it is used to represent and update the result of a sub-program. What were the different strategies explored in the paper for updating the cache token and which one worked the best? Why?

5. The hierarchical beam search technique is introduced in GAPS for generating high-quality solution programs. How does it align with and take advantage of the separated operator/operand generation process? Walk through the steps of how it explores different combinations.

6. One method proposed in the paper to improve geometry element selection is the "geometry elements enhancement" technique. Describe what this involves and how appending elements to the problem text enhances performance. How was this tested?

7. Analyze and discuss the differences in complexity and reasoning requirements between geometry calculation (CAL) problems and geometry proof (PRV) problems. How did this impact the performance of GAPS on the two problem types?

8. Additional geometry math datasets were incorporated to augment the training data of GAPS. How does GAPS' architecture enable effective supplementation of the training data? What was the impact observed on model performance with the augmented dataset?

9. The results show GAPS struggles to match top-1 accuracy compared to top-10 accuracy on CAL problems, indicating correct solutions were not always the top prediction. Analyze the potential reasons behind this discrepancy between CAL and PRV performance based on the findings.

10. What were some of the limitations of GAPS identified in the paper? What future work was proposed to address these limitations and enhance performance on calculation-based geometry problems?
