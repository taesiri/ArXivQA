# [Improving Generative Model-based Unfolding with Schrödinger Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12351)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop a machine learning-based unfolding method that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative models?The key points are:- Two main machine learning approaches for unfolding have emerged - discriminative models like OmniFold that learn a small correction, and generative models like cINN that scale better to low data regions. - The authors propose SBUnfold, which uses Schrödinger Bridges and diffusion models to map one set of events to another without having to model the probability density.- This allows SBUnfold to learn a small correction like OmniFold, while still training on simulation like cINN. So it should combine strengths of both approaches.- They test SBUnfold on a synthetic Z+jets dataset and show it achieves excellent performance compared to OmniFold and cINN, especially when data statistics are low.So in summary, the main research question is how to develop an unfolding method that combines the strengths of discriminative and generative models. The proposal is SBUnfold using Schrödinger Bridges, and results on a Z+jets dataset support its strengths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new unfolding method called SBUnfold that combines the strengths of discriminative and generative model-based unfolding approaches. 2. It uses Schrödinger Bridges and diffusion models to learn a mapping between detector-level and particle-level events without having to model the probability density. This allows SBUnfold to learn only a small correction like discriminative models while still scaling well to regions of phase space with little data like generative models.3. It demonstrates that SBUnfold achieves excellent performance compared to state-of-the-art unfolding methods like OmniFold and conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on a synthetic Z+jets dataset. Specifically, it shows SBUnfold outperforms cINN in fidelity and stability while also degrading more gracefully than OmniFold when there is limited data.4. It provides a detailed theoretical explanation and methodology for using Schrödinger Bridges for unfolding, helping connect ideas from optimal transport and generative modeling to particle physics.5. The code implementation is publicly available to facilitate uptake by the community.In summary, this paper introduces a novel unfolding technique using Schrödinger Bridges that combines strengths of existing methods and demonstrates its promising performance compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. The theory, methodology, and code availability also aim to increase adoption of these ideas more broadly.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of machine learning-based unfolding:- The key innovation of this paper is proposing a new unfolding method called SBUnfold that uses Schrödinger Bridges (SB). SB allows mapping between arbitrary distributions without having to model the distributions explicitly. This is an advantage over other generative model approaches like normalizing flows that have to model a tractable prior distribution. - SBUnfold combines strengths of two main unfolding approaches - discriminative models like OmniFold that learn a small correction, and generative models like cINN that handle low statistics regions better. So it aims to get the best of both worlds.- The authors benchmark SBUnfold on a standard unfolding dataset of Z+jets events from previous work. This allows direct comparison to other methods like OmniFold and cINN. The results show SBUnfold achieving excellent performance, outperforming the other methods on various metrics.- The idea of using generative models for the expectation step of an EM unfolding algorithm has been explored before in papers like cINN. The key novelty is using SBs instead of normalizing flows as the generative model. This paper focuses only on the E-step.- Most recent unfolding papers have focused on particle-level measurements. This paper uses a simplified fixed number of jet substructure observables. More complex/realistic benchmarks could further demonstrate the capabilities.Overall, I think this paper makes an important contribution by proposing a promising new generative model for unfolding based on an active area of machine learning research (SBs). The results convincingly demonstrate its strengths over existing methods. Testing on more complex unfolding problems and investigating integration of the M-step could be interesting future work to build on this paper. The approach looks highly promising for unfolding tasks in HEP and beyond.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Investigate the performance of SBUnfold on the full phase space of particles at particle-level and particle flow objects at detector-level. The current study focused on a small set of jet substructure observables. Applying SBUnfold to full particle-level events is noted as non-trivial due to the requirement of permutation invariance.- Study the maximization (M) step of the unfolding algorithm, in addition to the expectation (E) step focused on in this work. Compare how the unfolding results improve over multiple EM iterations between SBUnfold and other algorithms like IcINN.- Adapt SBUnfold to different data structures beyond fixed-size vectors, such as images, video, point clouds, etc. The diffusion process relies on a specific feature ordering, which may need to be modified for such data.- Improve the flexibility of the generative model to better handle distributions with sharp features or discontinuous observables like multiplicity. Normalizing flows, GANs, and other generative models could be explored.- Explore ways to reduce the sensitivity of the unfolded distributions to the choice of simulation sample used for training. The authors note the algorithm's "prior dependence" on the initial simulation.- Evaluate the performance of SBUnfold on real experimental data in addition to the simulated datasets in this study.- Investigate theoretical guarantees on the approximation capabilities and convergence properties of the Schrödinger bridge model.In summary, the main suggested directions are enhancing the flexibility of SBUnfold, reducing its dependence on simulations, applying it to more complex data structures, and evaluating its performance on real experimental data. Theoretical analysis is also noted as an area for further work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new machine learning-based unfolding technique called SBUnfold that combines strengths of previous generative model-based and discriminative model-based approaches. SBUnfold uses a Schrödinger Bridge and diffusion models to map simulated detector-level events to particle-level events without needing to model the probability density explicitly. This allows SBUnfold to learn a small correction like discriminative models while also leveraging simulation for training like generative models. The authors test SBUnfold on a synthetic Z+jets dataset and show it achieves excellent performance compared to existing state-of-the-art unfolding methods like OmniFold and conditional invertible neural networks (cINN). In particular, SBUnfold outperforms cINN due to handling distributions with sharp features better and outperforms OmniFold when data sample size is small. Overall, SBUnfold demonstrates strengths of both discriminative and generative approaches for unfolding.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new unfolding method called SBUnfold that combines strengths of both discriminative and generative models for machine learning-based unfolding. Unfolding corrects detector effects to infer true particle-level distributions from detector-level observables. SBUnfold uses a technique called a Schrödinger Bridge (SB) with a diffusion model to learn a mapping between detector-level and particle-level events. Unlike normalizing flows or standard diffusion models, the SB does not require mapping data to a known probability density. This allows SBUnfold to learn a small correction from simulation while still performing well in low statistics regions. The performance of SBUnfold is tested on a synthetic Z+jets dataset and compared to OmniFold (discriminative model approach) and cINN (generative model approach). Results show SBUnfold achieves excellent performance, outperforming cINN due to more informative priors and outperforming OmniFold in low statistics regions since it does not rely on data for training. The key advantage of SBUnfold is combining strengths of both discriminative and generative models for unfolding. The authors conclude that SBUnfold shows promise as a powerful unfolding technique.

SBUnfold uses a technique called a Schrödinger Bridge (SB) with a diffusion model to learn a generative model that maps between detector-level and particle-level events. Unlike normalizing flows or standard diffusion models, the SB does not require mapping to a known probability density. This allows SBUnfold to learn a small correction from simulation while still performing well with limited data, unlike purely discriminative approaches like OmniFold. The key advantage is that the generative model in SBUnfold trains only on simulation, avoiding issues when data is limited. The authors test SBUnfold on a synthetic Z+jets dataset and show it outperforms existing methods like the cINN and OmniFold in terms of metrics like earth mover's distance between the unfolded and true distributions. Overall, SBUnfold combines strengths of discriminative and generative models for improved unfolding.
