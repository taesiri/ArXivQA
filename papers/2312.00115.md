# [A Video is Worth 10,000 Words: Training and Benchmarking with Diverse   Captions for Better Long Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing long video retrieval systems are trained and tested only on paragraph-to-video retrieval, where each long video has a single paragraph description. This neglects the variety of valid ways to describe a video.
- Real-world video retrieval queries can be diverse - vague, abstract, partial, etc. Current systems are not trained or evaluated on such diverse queries. 

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the "10k Words" problem - a framework to characterize the spectrum of valid video descriptions, along axes like simplification, summarization, and duration.
- Build 10k Words datasets (ActivityNet10k, QuerYD10k, LF-VILA10k) by augmenting existing datasets with diverse synthetic captions generated via language models.
- Validate caption fidelity via automatic stats and human annotation. Captions are robust, preserve meaning, and contain few hallucinations.  
- Benchmark models on 10k Words datasets. Models struggle, especially on short summaries.
- Propose lightweight fine-tuning method to align projections of synthetic captions with real captions and videos using contrastive losses.

Contributions:
- Formulate 10k Words problem and build datasets using a flexible caption generation pipeline
- Show models fail to generalize to diverse queries through benchmarking
- Achieve SOTA on 10k Words problem while also boosting standard paragraph retrieval
- Demonstrate improvements in low-data regimes
- Introduce method to use synthetic captions to guide better text embeddings

The key idea is that using more diverse and synthetic captions, guided by the right objectives, can lead to better video-text alignment and long video understanding. The caption generation pipeline and downstream fine-tuning approach help achieve this.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes generating diverse video captions to train and evaluate long video retrieval systems more thoroughly, showing current models struggle on the new data while a novel contrastive finetuning approach leveraging the diverse descriptions improves performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formulates and proposes the "10k Words" problem, which is a framework for characterizing the broad spectrum of valid descriptions for long videos. 

2. It creates augmented versions of existing video datasets - ActivityNet10k, QuerYD10k, and LF-VILA10k - by using a flexible data generation pipeline to generate diverse captions for videos.

3. It benchmarks state-of-the-art video-language models on the 10k Words problem in a zero-shot setting, revealing that they struggle to generalize to the diverse video descriptions. 

4. It proposes a lightweight finetuning method using contrastive losses to align features from synthetic and real captions and videos. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 10k Words problem while also boosting performance on standard paragraph-to-video retrieval.

In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of the 10k Words problem to characterize the space of possible video descriptions, creation of datasets to enable research in this area, benchmarking and analysis of existing models, and a new finetuning method to improve video retrieval performance using the rich synthetic caption data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Long video retrieval - The paper focuses on retrieving long videos (over minutes or hours in length) given a text query, rather than short video clips.

- Diverse video captions - The paper generates a diverse set of synthetic video captions at different levels of detail and complexity to describe the same long video.

- 10k Words problem - The paper formulates this novel video retrieval setting with diverse video descriptions generated for long videos with multiple events. 

- ActivityNet10k/QuerYD10k/LF-VILA10k - Three new datasets created by augmenting existing datasets with diverse synthetic captions using language models.

- Benchmarking - The paper benchmarks several state-of-the-art video-language models on the 10k Words problem and finds they struggle, especially on short or partial captions.

- Contrastive finetuning - A method proposed to finetune models using both real and synthetic captions, with projection losses to align features.

- Improved video retrieval - The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the 10k Words problem as well as standard paragraph-to-video retrieval benchmarks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new data augmentation strategy to generate diverse captions for videos. How exactly does this caption generation pipeline work? What are the key components and steps? 

2. The paper introduces two new losses, the text-to-text loss and the text-to-video loss, for contrastive finetuning. What is the intuition behind adding these losses? How do they help the model learn better alignments between videos, synthetic captions, and real captions?

3. The mixing ratio hyperparameter η controls what percentage of the training batches contain synthetic vs real captions. What values of η work best and why? What happens if you set η=0 or η=1?

4. The paper shows that existing models struggle with the proposed 10k Words task, especially on short and partial captions. What specifically causes them difficulties - ambiguity, diversity, or something else? Provide examples from the results.  

5. The projection layer used for the text-to-text and text-to-video losses serves an important role. What would happen if you removed this projection layer? Why is it important?

6. The paper only uses a simple prompt-based approach without much human oversight to generate the synthetic captions. Do you think having more control over the caption generation process could further improve results? Why or why not?

7. The results show that the method provides nice gains on ActivityNet but more modest gains on other datasets like LF-VILA. What factors might account for these differences across datasets?

8. The paper focuses on leveraging the synthetic captions for training only. Do you think they could also be useful for evaluation purposes as well? What challenges might that introduce?

9. The method is only evaluated on the text-to-video retrieval task. What other downstream tasks could benefit from pretraining or finetuning with this kind of diverse caption data augmentation?

10. The contrastive losses used in this method could likely complement other existing methods that use different pretraining objectives like masked language modeling or generative captioning. How difficult do you think it would be to integrate these losses into other models' objectives? What challenges might arise?
