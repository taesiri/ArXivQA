# [A Video is Worth 10,000 Words: Training and Benchmarking with Diverse   Captions for Better Long Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing long video retrieval systems are trained and tested only on paragraph-to-video retrieval, where each long video has a single paragraph description. This neglects the variety of valid ways to describe a video.
- Real-world video retrieval queries can be diverse - vague, abstract, partial, etc. Current systems are not trained or evaluated on such diverse queries. 

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the "10k Words" problem - a framework to characterize the spectrum of valid video descriptions, along axes like simplification, summarization, and duration.
- Build 10k Words datasets (ActivityNet10k, QuerYD10k, LF-VILA10k) by augmenting existing datasets with diverse synthetic captions generated via language models.
- Validate caption fidelity via automatic stats and human annotation. Captions are robust, preserve meaning, and contain few hallucinations.  
- Benchmark models on 10k Words datasets. Models struggle, especially on short summaries.
- Propose lightweight fine-tuning method to align projections of synthetic captions with real captions and videos using contrastive losses.

Contributions:
- Formulate 10k Words problem and build datasets using a flexible caption generation pipeline
- Show models fail to generalize to diverse queries through benchmarking
- Achieve SOTA on 10k Words problem while also boosting standard paragraph retrieval
- Demonstrate improvements in low-data regimes
- Introduce method to use synthetic captions to guide better text embeddings

The key idea is that using more diverse and synthetic captions, guided by the right objectives, can lead to better video-text alignment and long video understanding. The caption generation pipeline and downstream fine-tuning approach help achieve this.
