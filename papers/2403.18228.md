# [Fourier or Wavelet bases as counterpart self-attention in spikformer for   efficient visual classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are more energy-efficient and biologically plausible than traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). The spikformer architecture incorporates self-attention from Transformers into SNNs, achieving higher accuracy and lower computational cost. 
- However, the spiking self-attention (SSA) used in spikformer still has high complexity of O(N^2), which can be further optimized within the sparse spike-based frameworks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes to replace SSA with a Fourier/Wavelet (FW) head, based on the hypothesis that both SSA and Fourier/Wavelet transforms use basis functions to represent information. 
- Specifically, the FW head uses fixed Fourier transform or wavelet transform bases to efficiently capture features from sparse spike inputs, instead of learning query/key bases like SSA.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Fourier/Wavelet-based Spikformer (FWformer) that replaces SSA with FW head for efficient sequence feature extraction.
- Achieves comparable or higher accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost compared to spikformer on both event-based video datasets (CIFAR10-DVS, DvsGesture) and static image datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100). 
- Reduces GPU memory usage by 4-26%, training/inference time by 9-70%, and estimated energy consumption by 20-25%.
- Analyzes orthogonality of SSA bases during training and finds they become non-orthogonal, inspiring the use of non-orthogonal wavelet basis combinations in FW head.
- Provides insights on when the proposed FWformer works well compared to vanilla self-attention, indicating promise for developing efficient Transformers inspired by biology and information theory.

In summary, the paper innovatively integrates Fourier/Wavelet transforms into SNN Transformer to form an efficient FWformer architecture for visual classification tasks. Both accuracy and computational performance are thoroughly evaluated, showing accuracy comparable to spikformer but significantly improved efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes replacing the spiking self-attention in spikformer with Fourier or wavelet transforms to achieve comparable accuracy, higher speed, lower memory usage, and reduced energy consumption for visual classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The authors propose to replace the Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) module in spikformer with a Fourier-or-Wavelet-based (FW) module. This is based on the hypothesis that both SSA and Fourier/Wavelet transforms use a set of basis functions to transform information.

2. The proposed FWformer achieves comparable or higher accuracy than spikformer on image classification tasks, while requiring lower computational complexity. Specifically, it reduces memory usage by 4-26%, theoretical energy consumption by 20-25%, and improves training and inference speeds by 9-51% and 19-70% respectively.

3. The authors analyze the orthogonality of the basis functions learned by SSA during training. They find that the bases become less orthogonal over time, inspiring them to explore using non-orthogonal combinations of wavelet bases which further improves accuracy. 

4. The authors provide an analysis of when their proposed FWformer is most applicable - for simpler tasks like event-based video processing where the sparse spike-based features do not require complex relationships to be modeled by dynamic self-learned bases.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a more efficient Transformer architecture for spike-based processing, obtained by replacing self-attention with Fourier and wavelet transforms.

4. The paper explores using different wavelet bases in the FW module, including Haar, Db1, Bior1.1 etc. Compare and contrast the characteristics of these different bases. Why does the choice of basis not seem to significantly impact accuracy?  

5. The paper shows that SSA bases become less orthogonal during training. Explain this phenomenon. How does the paper leverage this finding to motivate exploring combined non-orthogonal wavelet bases?

8. The paper briefly speculates on when FW bases are applicable. Further analyze what key properties of a dataset or task indicate FW bases will be beneficial over learned dynamic bases.

9. The FW bases are motivated by efficiency, but what impact could the use of fixed bases have on model interpretability? Evaluate the interpretability of FW bases versus SSA.
