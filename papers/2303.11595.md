# [Effective Ambiguity Attack Against Passport-based DNN Intellectual   Property Protection Schemes through Fully Connected Layer Substitution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11595)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether passport-based deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property (IP) protection schemes are secure against advanced ambiguity attacks. 

The main hypothesis is that passport-based methods, which were previously claimed to be immune to existing ambiguity attacks, can actually be defeated by a novel and effective ambiguity attack proposed in this paper.

Specifically, the paper aims to design an ambiguity attack that is capable of generating valid substitute passports for passport-protected DNNs using only a small amount of training data. Valid substitute passports allow attackers to claim ownership of the model while maintaining similar performance.

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Experimentally justifying the existence of multiple valid substitute passports that satisfy both indistinguishable model performance and large difference from the original passport.

- Proposing two structures called IERB and CERB to replace passport layers, which assist the search for valid substitute passports. 

- Designing an ambiguity attack algorithm leveraging IERB/CERB structures and limited training data.

- Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the attack can restore model accuracy using less than 10% training data while generating significantly different passports.

- Showing the attack strategy generalizes well to other DNN watermarking methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that passport-based IP protection can be defeated by an advanced ambiguity attack, which is then confirmed through both theoretical analysis and empirical results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective ambiguity attack against passport-based DNN intellectual property protection schemes. The key points are:

- They propose a novel and effective ambiguity attack that can generate valid substitute passports for passport-protected DNN models using only a small amount of training data (less than 10%). 

- They design two structures called Individual Expanded Residual Block (IERB) and Collective Expanded Residual Block (CERB) to replace the passport layers. These structures help search for valid substitute passports during training.

- Experiments show their attack can restore the functionality of passport-protected models with negligible performance loss (<2%) compared to using the original passports, while the substitute passports are very different from the original ones.

- The attack works for both overlapping and non-overlapping training datasets. It is also shown to work on other watermark-based DNN protection schemes.

In summary, the paper breaks the security claims of passport-based DNN intellectual property protection by proposing an ambiguity attack that can forge valid substitute passports with limited data. This is the first attack shown to be effective against passport-based protection schemes.
