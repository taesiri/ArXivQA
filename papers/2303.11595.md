# [Effective Ambiguity Attack Against Passport-based DNN Intellectual   Property Protection Schemes through Fully Connected Layer Substitution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11595)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether passport-based deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property (IP) protection schemes are secure against advanced ambiguity attacks. 

The main hypothesis is that passport-based methods, which were previously claimed to be immune to existing ambiguity attacks, can actually be defeated by a novel and effective ambiguity attack proposed in this paper.

Specifically, the paper aims to design an ambiguity attack that is capable of generating valid substitute passports for passport-protected DNNs using only a small amount of training data. Valid substitute passports allow attackers to claim ownership of the model while maintaining similar performance.

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Experimentally justifying the existence of multiple valid substitute passports that satisfy both indistinguishable model performance and large difference from the original passport.

- Proposing two structures called IERB and CERB to replace passport layers, which assist the search for valid substitute passports. 

- Designing an ambiguity attack algorithm leveraging IERB/CERB structures and limited training data.

- Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the attack can restore model accuracy using less than 10% training data while generating significantly different passports.

- Showing the attack strategy generalizes well to other DNN watermarking methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that passport-based IP protection can be defeated by an advanced ambiguity attack, which is then confirmed through both theoretical analysis and empirical results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective ambiguity attack against passport-based DNN intellectual property protection schemes. The key points are:

- They propose a novel and effective ambiguity attack that can generate valid substitute passports for passport-protected DNN models using only a small amount of training data (less than 10%). 

- They design two structures called Individual Expanded Residual Block (IERB) and Collective Expanded Residual Block (CERB) to replace the passport layers. These structures help search for valid substitute passports during training.

- Experiments show their attack can restore the functionality of passport-protected models with negligible performance loss (<2%) compared to using the original passports, while the substitute passports are very different from the original ones.

- The attack works for both overlapping and non-overlapping training datasets. It is also shown to work on other watermark-based DNN protection schemes.

In summary, the paper breaks the security claims of passport-based DNN intellectual property protection by proposing an ambiguity attack that can forge valid substitute passports with limited data. This is the first attack shown to be effective against passport-based protection schemes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel and effective ambiguity attack against passport-based intellectual property protection schemes for deep neural networks, which can successfully forge multiple valid passports with a small training dataset by inserting a specially designed accessory block ahead of the passport parameters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on defending against ambiguity attacks on DNN watermarking methods:

- This paper proposes a novel and effective ambiguity attack that is able to defeat passport-based DNN watermarking methods, which were previously claimed to be secure against such attacks. Previous ambiguity attacks focused mainly on non-passport based methods.

- The attack uses a small training dataset (less than 10% of original data) to craft valid substitute passports that lead to similar model performance as the original. This is a very practical attack scenario. 

- The paper designs two novel structures - IERB and CERB - to assist the attack by encouraging changes to passport parameters during training. This helps search the space to find good substitute passports.

- Experiments show the attack works well across different model architectures, datasets, and even with non-overlapping training data. The attack performance is strong, restoring over 90% of original accuracy in some cases.

- The attack strategy is shown to generalize well to other non-passport based watermarking methods, making it broadly applicable.

- Compared to prior work on removal attacks that just erase the watermark, this ambiguity attack allows the attacker to claim ownership with the forged passport, making it more threatening.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions by proposing the first ambiguity attack that breaks passport-based defenses, while also showing the attack generalizes across methods and scenarios. The results cast serious doubt on the viability of existing DNN watermarking defenses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following future research directions:

- Explore theoretical justifications for the existence of multiple valid substitute passports that satisfy the ambiguity attack conditions. The paper currently provides experimental verification, but theoretical analysis would provide further insights. 

- Investigate randomized passport layer positions controlled by a secret key, to make it more difficult for attackers to localize and replace passport layers. 

- Explore embedding the passport in model activations instead of weights, and constraining the activation statistics to be unique to each signature. This could potentially make the model functionality more dependent on the specific passport.

- Evaluate the effectiveness of the attack on more complex and larger-scale models like vision transformers. The paper currently focuses on CNNs.

- Study remedies to make passport-based methods more resistant to the proposed expanded residual block structures. For example, adding regularization terms to prevent significant passport parameter changes.

- Generalize the attack strategies to other types of neural network watermarking and fingerprinting schemes beyond the ones discussed.

- Evaluate the impact of different training strategies like transfer learning on the ambiguity attack success.

In summary, the main suggestions are around providing theoretical justifications, enhancing passport randomization, exploring new embedding domains like activations, evaluating on more advanced models, developing defenses, generalizing to other watermarking schemes, and studying the impact of different training methodologies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel and effective ambiguity attack against passport-based intellectual property (IP) protection schemes for deep neural networks (DNNs). Passport-based methods, which replace normalization layers with passport layers, have been claimed to be secure against advanced attacks. This work designs an ambiguity attack capable of successfully forging multiple valid passports with only a small training dataset. The attack is accomplished by inserting a specially designed accessory block called the Expanded Residual Block (ERB) ahead of the passport parameters. Using less than 10% of the original training data, the forged passport leads to almost indistinguishable model performance (within 2% difference) compared to the authorized passport. Experiments on overlapping and non-overlapping datasets, different network structures, and other watermarking methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack. The paper also provides potential directions for remedying solutions, like using random passport layer locations based on a secret key, or changing the embedding position from model weights to activations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel and effective ambiguity attack against passport-based deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property (IP) protection schemes. Passport-based methods have been one of the few IP protection solutions claimed to be secure against advanced attacks. The paper shows that multiple valid substitute passports exist that can restore the model functionality with different passports. To find these substitute passports with limited data, the authors propose two structures - Individual Expanded Residual Block (IERB) and Collective Expanded Residual Block (CERB) - to replace the passport layers. These encourage significant parameter changes in the passport layers during training to search for valid substitutes. Experiments on different models and datasets show the attack is effective in restoring accuracy within 2% of the original model while producing passports very different from the authorized ones. The attack also works with non-overlapping datasets. Finally, the attack strategy generalizes well to other watermarking schemes like Uchida's method.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) proposing an effective ambiguity attack on passport-based IP protection using the IERB and CERB structures; (2) experimentally demonstrating the existence of multiple valid substitute passports that can restore functionality; (3) showing the attack works with limited data and non-overlapping datasets; and (4) generalizing the attack strategy to other watermarking schemes. The results cast doubt on the security of passport-based methods against advanced ambiguity attacks. Potential remedies are changing passport layer positions randomly based on a secret key or moving embedding from weights to activations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel ambiguity attack against passport-based intellectual property (IP) protection schemes for deep neural networks (DNNs). The passport-based method embeds a signature called a "passport" into the normalization layers of a DNN model. The key idea of the ambiguity attack is to replace the passport layers with specially designed structures called Individual Expanded Residual Block (IERB) and Collective Expanded Residual Block (CERB). These structures contain multi-layer perceptrons and skip connections that encourage the passport parameters to change significantly during training. This allows the attack to search for valid substitute passports that lead to similar model performance but are very different from the original authorized passport. With less than 10% of the original training data, the attack can recover over 90% of the original accuracy while producing passport parameters that are highly dissimilar from the original. The attack demonstrates weaknesses in the passport-based protection method against ambiguity attacks.
