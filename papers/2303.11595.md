# [Effective Ambiguity Attack Against Passport-based DNN Intellectual   Property Protection Schemes through Fully Connected Layer Substitution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11595)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether passport-based deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property (IP) protection schemes are secure against advanced ambiguity attacks. 

The main hypothesis is that passport-based methods, which were previously claimed to be immune to existing ambiguity attacks, can actually be defeated by a novel and effective ambiguity attack proposed in this paper.

Specifically, the paper aims to design an ambiguity attack that is capable of generating valid substitute passports for passport-protected DNNs using only a small amount of training data. Valid substitute passports allow attackers to claim ownership of the model while maintaining similar performance.

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Experimentally justifying the existence of multiple valid substitute passports that satisfy both indistinguishable model performance and large difference from the original passport.

- Proposing two structures called IERB and CERB to replace passport layers, which assist the search for valid substitute passports. 

- Designing an ambiguity attack algorithm leveraging IERB/CERB structures and limited training data.

- Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the attack can restore model accuracy using less than 10% training data while generating significantly different passports.

- Showing the attack strategy generalizes well to other DNN watermarking methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that passport-based IP protection can be defeated by an advanced ambiguity attack, which is then confirmed through both theoretical analysis and empirical results.
