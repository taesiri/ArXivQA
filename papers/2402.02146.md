# [Emergency Computing: An Adaptive Collaborative Inference Method Based on   Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Establishing reliable and rapid emergency communication networks during natural disasters is challenging due to infrastructure damage, limited resources, and dynamic environments.  
- Existing emergency networks have issues with slow user access, unreliable data transmission, inflexible topologies unable to adapt to changing conditions.
- There is a need for an intelligent emergency network that integrates communication, computation, caching and sensing capabilities to enable dynamic adaptation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the E-SC3I framework which incorporates four key capabilities:
  1) Emergency computing: Enables collaborative inference across edge and cloud nodes for low-latency services like disaster detection and image recognition.
  2) Emergency caching: Uses coded caching to improve reliability of transmitting large files like maps and videos.
  3) Integrated sensing: Combines communication network with environmental sensors for rapid construction of 3D site maps to guide network optimization.
  4) Intelligence: Uses AI for dynamic network deployment optimization based on time-varying conditions and demands.

- For emergency computing, an Adaptive Collaborative Inference Method (ACIM) is proposed based on hierarchical reinforcement learning to jointly optimize model pruning and partitioning for efficient collaborative inference under resource constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel E-SC3I framework to establish an intelligent emergency communication network with integrated sensing, computation and caching capabilities for rapid, reliable and adaptable services.
- Specifically focuses on optimizing emergency computing and proposes an ACIM method that uses hierarchical reinforcement learning to coupledly determine partition positions and pruning rates to minimize collaborative inference latency under accuracy constraints.  
- Experimental results demonstrate ACIM can reduce inference latency by up to 32% compared to prior pruning methods, enabling time-sensitive services like disaster detection and transmission.

In summary, the paper presents the E-SC3I framework to realize an intelligent emergency network, and concentrates efforts on optimizing emergency computing services through a novel ACIM method based on hierarchical reinforcement learning.
