# [Resource-Efficient Neural Architect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07912)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we efficiently search for neural network architectures that achieve high performance under given hardware resource constraints?

Some key points:

- The paper proposes a framework called Resource-Efficient Neural Architect (RENA) for automated neural architecture search with consideration of hardware resource constraints. 

- RENA uses reinforcement learning and network morphism techniques to efficiently search the architecture space.

- The search objective is to maximize model performance, while meeting constraints on metrics like model size, compute complexity, and compute intensity that relate to hardware implementation.

- RENA is demonstrated on image classification on CIFAR-10 and keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset. It is able to find architectures that achieve competitive accuracy under tight resource constraints.

So in summary, the main research question is around efficiently automating neural architecture search to find high-performing architectures that satisfy specified hardware resource limitations. The key hypothesis is that techniques like RL and network morphism can enable effective resource-constrained NAS within a reasonable search budget. The results on the two tasks provide supporting evidence for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a resource-constrained neural architecture search (NAS) framework called Resource-Efficient Neural Architect (RENA) that can find high-performance neural network architectures under different resource constraints. 

2. Designing a policy network with network embedding to efficiently adapt existing models rather than building architectures from scratch. The policy network uses predefined actions like scale, insert and remove to modify the network.

3. Introducing a framework to modify the reward function for meeting hardware constraints by using simple metrics like model size, compute complexity and compute intensity.

4. Demonstrating RENA on image classification using CIFAR-10 and keyword spotting using Google Speech Commands dataset. RENA is able to find novel architectures that achieve high accuracy even with tight resource constraints.

5. Showing competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models on the two tasks. For CIFAR-10, RENA achieves 2.95% test error under compute intensity constraint and 3.87% error under model size constraint. For speech commands, it achieves 95.81% accuracy without constraints and maintains high accuracy under tight constraints.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an automated and efficient NAS framework called RENA that can find neural architectures tailored to meet specific hardware resource constraints while maximizing accuracy. The key ideas are using a policy network with network embedding for efficient search, and modifying rewards for meeting constraints.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a resource-constrained neural architecture search method called RENA that uses a policy network with network embedding and reinforcement learning to efficiently find neural network architectures that meet given constraints on model size, compute complexity, and compute intensity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other related work on neural architecture search (NAS):

- The authors propose a resource-constrained NAS method called RENA that considers hardware efficiency constraints like model size, compute complexity, and compute intensity in finding optimal architectures. Most prior NAS work focuses only on maximizing accuracy without considering resource usage. 

- RENA uses a policy network with network embedding to efficiently search for architectures by adapting existing models rather than building completely from scratch. Other NAS methods like evolutionary algorithms or Bayesian optimization build models from scratch which can be very slow.

- The authors demonstrate RENA on image classification and keyword spotting tasks. For CIFAR10, RENA achieves high accuracy even with tight constraints on model size or compute intensity. For speech commands, it matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy while meeting specified resource limits.

- Compared to methods like ENAS, DARTS, or NAO that require huge computational resources to search over thousands of models, RENA can find good architectures with only hundreds of searched models. This makes it more practical to use.

- While some other works have started considering efficiency, such as proxylessNAS, FBNet, or ChamNet, RENA seems to be one of the first to formulate resource constraints directly into the NAS optimization framework through the reward function.

Overall, this paper presents a nice framework for enabling constrained NAS that complements other NAS techniques focused purely on accuracy maximization. The efficiency constraints and modest compute requirements for search make RENA appealing for real-world applications. Key limitations may be the simple proxy metrics used for hardware efficiency, and testing on more complex datasets. But it's an interesting step towards more practical and scalable NAS.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:

- Exploring different policy network architectures besides LSTM, such as Transformer or Graph Neural Networks, to represent the neural architecture more effectively. 

- Investigating other efficient search spaces besides layer-by-layer and module search. The authors mention block-wise search as a potential direction.

- Considering more complex and accurate models of resource use, such as actual latency, power, and memory footprint on target hardware platforms.

- Evaluating the approach on more tasks beyond image classification and keyword spotting, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, speech recognition etc.

- Investigating multi-objective NAS with more than two simultaneous objectives.

- Scaling up the search to find good architectures on larger datasets like ImageNet.

- Studying theoretical properties of the proposed method such as regret bounds.

- Comparing against more baselines like evolutionary algorithms or gradient-based NAS methods.

In summary, the main future directions are around exploring alternative policy network designs, search spaces, resource modeling techniques, evaluation tasks, and theoretical analysis. Overall the paper provides a good foundation for research on resource-aware neural architecture search.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Resource-Efficient Neural Architect (RENA), a resource-constrained neural architecture search framework using reinforcement learning with network embedding. RENA uses a policy network that processes network embeddings to generate actions that modify the architecture, like scaling layer hyperparameters, inserting new layers, or removing existing ones. This allows efficient search by adapting existing models rather than building from scratch. The reward function incorporates both model performance and resource usage metrics like model size, computational complexity, and compute intensity. This enables finding high-performance architectures under hardware resource constraints. 

RENA is demonstrated on CIFAR-10 image classification and Google Speech Commands keyword spotting. For CIFAR-10, it achieves under 3% test error even with tight constraints like model size under 3M parameters or compute intensity over 100 FLOPs/byte. For keyword spotting, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without constraints, and outperforms optimized architectures under tight resource constraints like model size under 0.1M parameters. The results show RENA can efficiently find novel architectures optimized for a target task under specified hardware resource limitations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

The paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework named Resource-Efficient Neural Architect (RENA) for finding neural network architectures that achieve high accuracy under resource constraints. RENA uses a policy network with network embedding to generate architecture modifications. Specifically, it represents the architecture using layer embeddings that are fed to an LSTM policy network. The policy network outputs actions to scale layer hyperparameters, insert new layers, or remove existing layers, in order to modify the architecture. It is trained using policy gradient with a reward function that incorporates both accuracy and resource metrics like model size, compute complexity, and compute intensity. By modifying the rewards based on resource use, RENA can find architectures optimized for different hardware constraints. Overall, RENA provides an efficient NAS approach to automate finding high-performance architectures under resource limitations.
