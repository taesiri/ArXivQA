# [The FinBen: An Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their capabilities in the financial domain. Existing benchmarks like FLUE and PIXIU have limited scope focused solely on financial NLP tasks.  
- They fail to assess crucial facets like comprehending financial knowledge, resolving realistic financial tasks, and human-like cognitive abilities in finance. This hinders a nuanced understanding of LLM strengths and limitations.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces FinBen, the first open-sourced, systematic benchmark tailored to assess LLMs' financial capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- FinBen encompasses 35 diverse datasets across 23 financial tasks, spanning text analysis, knowledge extraction, question answering, stock prediction, credit scoring etc.

- It is organized into 3 Spectrums of increasing difficulty inspired by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory to evaluate cognitive skills from inductive reasoning to general intelligence.  

- Spectrum I has foundational NLP tasks, Spectrum II advances into generation and forecasting demanding deeper cognition. Spectrum III focuses on stock trading, showcasing application of general intelligence.

- Evaluation of 15 major LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT and Gemini reveals strengths and weaknesses - GPT-4 leads in quantification and extraction while Gemini excels in generation and forecasting. But gaps exist in numerical reasoning, complex extraction and forecasting.

- FinBen seeks to continuously track LLMs in finance, updated with more tasks and models to advance financial AI capabilities. It distinguishes itself through its breadth, multi-modality, task diversity and structured assessment of cognition.

In summary, FinBen pioneers as an extensive, structured benchmark tailored to further our understanding of sophisticated LLMs specialized for finance through a spectrum of cognitive evaluations. Its public availability facilitates responsible testing and development of financial AI.
