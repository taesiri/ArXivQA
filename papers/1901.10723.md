# [Compositionality for Recursive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10723)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how recursive neural networks for computing compositionality of meaning can be understood within the framework of categorical compositional distributional semantics. In particular, the paper shows how a simplified linear version of recursive neural tensor networks can be directly mapped onto the categorical compositional framework. The key hypothesis is that making this connection between recursive neural networks and categorical compositional semantics can provide benefits for both approaches:- For categorical semantics, it provides a more feasible way to compute the required matrices/tensors for functional words like adjectives and verbs. This addresses a major criticism of categorical semantics - that forming the high dimensional tensors is infeasible. - For recursive neural networks, connecting them to formal semantics provides ways to analyze certain words (like pronouns) as having routing/copying semantics rather than statistical semantics. This can simplify what the neural network itself has to learn.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that connecting these two approaches to compositionality - categorical semantics and recursive neural networks - can provide computational benefits and improve linguistic analysis for both frameworks. The research question is how exactly to formalize this connection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is showing how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach to compositional vector space semantics. This provides a way to compute the high-dimensional matrices and tensors needed in the categorical approach using recursive neural networks. Some key points:- The categorical approach nicely maps grammars onto vector spaces but requires forming very high-dimensional tensors, making it computationally infeasible. - Recursive neural tensor networks provide a more tractable model of compositionality but lack an explicit connection to formal semantics.- This paper shows how a linear version of recursive neural tensor networks can be directly modeled within the categorical compositional framework.- This mapping suggests ways to improve both approaches - making training easier for categorical models, and incorporating insights from formal semantics into neural models.- Overall, the main contribution seems to be establishing this mapping between neural and categorical models to leverage the strengths of both approaches. The paper argues this can enable progress in compositional vector space semantics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions:- Testing the performance of linear TreeRNNs against standard categorical approaches and standard TreeRNNs. This includes testing linear TreeRNNs with specialized word-type networks.- Testing TreeRNNs with formally analyzed information-routing words like relative and reflexive pronouns. - Investigating the effects of allowing words to switch between word types in the models.- Extending the analysis of information-routing words to other pronouns, anaphora, logical words, and quantifiers. - Incorporating non-linearity into the categorical framework, potentially using monoidal biclosed categories and Lambek categorial grammar.- Applying the analysis to other types of recurrent neural networks like LSTMs and GRUs.- Implementation work including actually training the proposed models and comparing their performance.In summary, they suggest both theoretical extensions to analyze more words formally and make the framework more expressive, as well as empirical work to train and evaluate the proposed models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper shows how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach to compositionality in vector semantics, bridging these two approaches. This mapping provides a way to compute the high-dimensional matrices and tensors needed in the categorical approach using the more tractable representations from neural networks. It also allows sharing strengths between the approaches, enabling neural network models to incorporate ideas from formal semantics and categorical models to use more fluid word representations. Overall, the mapping suggests several lines of research for improving both categorical compositional vector space models and recursive neural network models of compositionality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper shows how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach to compositionality in vector space semantics. The categorical approach maps grammar onto vector spaces in a principled way, but requires forming very high-dimensional matrices and tensors. Recursive neural tensor networks are more computationally feasible but lack the principled connection to formal semantics. By showing how a simplified version of recursive neural tensor networks corresponds to the categorical approach, this mapping provides a way to compute the required matrices and tensors while retaining the connection to formal semantics. It also suggests ways that the two approaches can benefit from each other, such as using ideas from formal semantics to simplify neural networks and making word types more fluid in the categorical approach.Specifically, the paper demonstrates how a linear version of recursive neural tensor networks, without any nonlinear activation functions, corresponds exactly to the categorical compositional framework using compact closed categories and pregroup grammar. This means that rather than learning large tensors for each functional word, only a small number of linear compositionality functions need to be learned along with word vectors. The paper gives examples of analyzing relative and reflexive pronouns using ideas from formal semantics rather than learned parameters. Overall, the mapping between simplified recursive networks and the categorical approach enables taking advantage of the strengths of each approach and paves the way for further research at their intersection.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a way to map linear recursive neural tensor networks onto categorical compositional vector space models of meaning. It shows how simplifying the compositionality function in recursive neural networks to be just tensor contraction creates an immediate correspondence to the categorical framework using compact closed categories and pregroup grammars. This mapping provides benefits to both approaches - it gives a simpler training method for the categorical approach and provides a way to incorporate ideas from formal semantics into neural models. Overall, the mapping establishes a connection between neural network and formal semantics approaches to modeling natural language meaning.
