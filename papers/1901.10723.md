# [Compositionality for Recursive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10723)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how recursive neural networks for computing compositionality of meaning can be understood within the framework of categorical compositional distributional semantics. In particular, the paper shows how a simplified linear version of recursive neural tensor networks can be directly mapped onto the categorical compositional framework. 

The key hypothesis is that making this connection between recursive neural networks and categorical compositional semantics can provide benefits for both approaches:

- For categorical semantics, it provides a more feasible way to compute the required matrices/tensors for functional words like adjectives and verbs. This addresses a major criticism of categorical semantics - that forming the high dimensional tensors is infeasible. 

- For recursive neural networks, connecting them to formal semantics provides ways to analyze certain words (like pronouns) as having routing/copying semantics rather than statistical semantics. This can simplify what the neural network itself has to learn.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that connecting these two approaches to compositionality - categorical semantics and recursive neural networks - can provide computational benefits and improve linguistic analysis for both frameworks. The research question is how exactly to formalize this connection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is showing how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach to compositional vector space semantics. This provides a way to compute the high-dimensional matrices and tensors needed in the categorical approach using recursive neural networks. 

Some key points:

- The categorical approach nicely maps grammars onto vector spaces but requires forming very high-dimensional tensors, making it computationally infeasible. 

- Recursive neural tensor networks provide a more tractable model of compositionality but lack an explicit connection to formal semantics.

- This paper shows how a linear version of recursive neural tensor networks can be directly modeled within the categorical compositional framework.

- This mapping suggests ways to improve both approaches - making training easier for categorical models, and incorporating insights from formal semantics into neural models.

- Overall, the main contribution seems to be establishing this mapping between neural and categorical models to leverage the strengths of both approaches. The paper argues this can enable progress in compositional vector space semantics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Testing the performance of linear TreeRNNs against standard categorical approaches and standard TreeRNNs. This includes testing linear TreeRNNs with specialized word-type networks.

- Testing TreeRNNs with formally analyzed information-routing words like relative and reflexive pronouns. 

- Investigating the effects of allowing words to switch between word types in the models.

- Extending the analysis of information-routing words to other pronouns, anaphora, logical words, and quantifiers. 

- Incorporating non-linearity into the categorical framework, potentially using monoidal biclosed categories and Lambek categorial grammar.

- Applying the analysis to other types of recurrent neural networks like LSTMs and GRUs.

- Implementation work including actually training the proposed models and comparing their performance.

In summary, they suggest both theoretical extensions to analyze more words formally and make the framework more expressive, as well as empirical work to train and evaluate the proposed models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper shows how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach to compositionality in vector semantics, bridging these two approaches. This mapping provides a way to compute the high-dimensional matrices and tensors needed in the categorical approach using the more tractable representations from neural networks. It also allows sharing strengths between the approaches, enabling neural network models to incorporate ideas from formal semantics and categorical models to use more fluid word representations. Overall, the mapping suggests several lines of research for improving both categorical compositional vector space models and recursive neural network models of compositionality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper shows how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach to compositionality in vector space semantics. The categorical approach maps grammar onto vector spaces in a principled way, but requires forming very high-dimensional matrices and tensors. Recursive neural tensor networks are more computationally feasible but lack the principled connection to formal semantics. By showing how a simplified version of recursive neural tensor networks corresponds to the categorical approach, this mapping provides a way to compute the required matrices and tensors while retaining the connection to formal semantics. It also suggests ways that the two approaches can benefit from each other, such as using ideas from formal semantics to simplify neural networks and making word types more fluid in the categorical approach.

Specifically, the paper demonstrates how a linear version of recursive neural tensor networks, without any nonlinear activation functions, corresponds exactly to the categorical compositional framework using compact closed categories and pregroup grammar. This means that rather than learning large tensors for each functional word, only a small number of linear compositionality functions need to be learned along with word vectors. The paper gives examples of analyzing relative and reflexive pronouns using ideas from formal semantics rather than learned parameters. Overall, the mapping between simplified recursive networks and the categorical approach enables taking advantage of the strengths of each approach and paves the way for further research at their intersection.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a way to map linear recursive neural tensor networks onto categorical compositional vector space models of meaning. It shows how simplifying the compositionality function in recursive neural networks to be just tensor contraction creates an immediate correspondence to the categorical framework using compact closed categories and pregroup grammars. This mapping provides benefits to both approaches - it gives a simpler training method for the categorical approach and provides a way to incorporate ideas from formal semantics into neural models. Overall, the mapping establishes a connection between neural network and formal semantics approaches to modeling natural language meaning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of modeling compositionality in vector space semantics. Specifically, it discusses two approaches:

- Categorical compositional distributional semantics, which maps grammar onto vector spaces in a principled way but requires forming high-dimensional matrices/tensors which is computationally infeasible. 

- Recursive neural networks like TreeRNNs which are more computationally tractable but lack an explicit connection to formal semantics. 

The main question the paper aims to address is how to combine these two approaches to get the benefits of both - the principled grammar-grounding of the categorical approach and the computational feasibility of the neural methods.

The key idea is to show that a simplified, linear version of TreeRNNs can be directly mapped onto the categorical compositional framework. This provides a way to compute the required matrices/tensors that avoids the feasibility issues, while retaining the formal semantic grounding. 

So in summary, the paper is trying to address how to model compositionality in vector spaces in a way that is both principled from a formal semantics view and computationally/practically feasible. The mapping between simplified TreeRNNs and categorical compositional semantics is proposed as a way to achieve both.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract, this paper presents a novel mapping between two existing approaches to modelling compositionality in vector space semantics:

- The categorical compositional distributional model of Coecke et al. This maps grammar onto vector spaces in a principled way, but suffers from requiring very high-dimensional matrices and tensors that are computationally infeasible.

- Recursive neural network models like those of Socher et al. and Bowman et al. These are more computationally tractable but lack an explicit connection to formal semantics. 

The key contribution seems to be showing how a linear simplification of recursive neural networks can be directly mapped onto the categorical compositional model. This provides a way to compute the required matrices and tensors in the categorical approach. It also allows incorporating ideas from formal semantics into neural models.

Compared to other work:

- This makes a novel link between two major strands of compositional vector space semantics that were previously quite separate.

- It provides a way to improve feasibility of the categorical approach, which has been criticized as intractable.

- It enables neural models to leverage insights from formal semantics in a more direct way.

- Much prior work either focused just on one approach (categorical or neural) or combined them only at a high level. This shows a precise mathematical mapping between simplified versions of each.

So in summary, it makes an important contribution in closely integrating neural and formal semantic models of compositionality in vector spaces. The mapping between simplified models of each is the unique aspect compared to prior work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some key terms and concepts are:

- Compositionality - The principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions/words and the rules used to combine them. A core concept explored in the paper.

- Vector space semantics - Representing the meanings of words as vectors, usually derived from text corpora. Allows meanings to be composed using vector operations.

- Recursive neural networks - Neural network models that mirror the syntactic structure of sentences, combining word vectors recursively according to the parse tree. Allows neural models to capture compositionality. 

- Categorical compositional distributional semantics - A framework that uses category theory to map grammar onto vector spaces in a principled way. Provides a formal model of compositionality.  

- Pregroup grammars - A type of categorial grammar used in the categorical framework to provide the compositional structure.

- Tensor contraction models - Categorical models that rely on high-dimensional tensors to model composition, running into feasibility issues.

- TreeRNN / TreeRNTN - Specific recursive neural network models analyzed in the paper. The linear simplification of these models is mapped onto the categorical framework.

So in summary, key terms revolve around vector space semantics, neural compositional models, categorical compositional models, and formal grammars, and how these approaches can be unified.
