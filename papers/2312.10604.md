# [A Dual Domain Multi-exposure Image Fusion Network based on the   Spatial-Frequency Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10604)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-exposure image fusion aims to combine images of the same scene with different exposure levels into a single high dynamic range image that preserves details in both bright and dark regions. 
- Existing methods focus only on fusing in the spatial domain using CNNs, which struggles to capture global illumination relationships between images. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a spatial-frequency integration framework (MEF-SFI) that incorporates both spatial and frequency domain information for fusion using Fourier transforms.
- A spatial path extracts local features using a DenseNet architecture. A frequency path captures global illumination via amplitude and phase components in the Fourier domain. 
- Spatial-Frequency Fusion Modules enable interaction between spatial and frequency domains using attention to integrate complementary information.
- A spatial-frequency loss with terms in both domains constrains local detail and global brightness consistency.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to jointly leverage spatial and frequency domain information for multi-exposure image fusion using deep Fourier transforms.
- Design of a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Module to enable rich interaction between local and global representations.
- Introduction of a Fourier-based loss function to ensure fused images match input brightness ranges.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative fusion performance on the PQA-MEF dataset by effectively combining local detail and global illumination modeling.

In summary, the key innovation is the joint spatial-frequency modeling to overcome limitations of previous CNN-only approaches for multi-exposure fusion. This is achieved through architectural design and associated loss formulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-exposure image fusion method that leverages both global illumination modeling through Fourier transform and local detail modeling via convolutional neural networks for spatial-frequency integration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) It proposes a novel approach for multi-exposure image fusion by leveraging deep Fourier transformation to utilize the global illumination modeling ability of the frequency domain. This is the first work to introduce joint spatial and frequency domain information interaction for multi-exposure image fusion.

2) It designs a spatial-frequency integration framework (MEF-SFI) with dual paths to extract spatial and frequency features from input images. Multiple spatial-frequency fusion modules are introduced to enable sufficient global and local information interaction. 

3) A Fourier-based loss function is proposed to constrain the global frequency difference between fusion results and input images in addition to spatial loss.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves visually appealing and exposure-consistent fusion results on the PAQ-MEF dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of the frequency modeling and spatial-frequency interaction design.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel spatial-frequency integration framework for multi-exposure image fusion, which effectively utilizes both local and global information to generate high-quality fusion results.
