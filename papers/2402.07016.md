# [REALM: RAG-Driven Enhancement of Multimodal Electronic Health Records   Analysis via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing models for analyzing multimodal electronic health records (EHR) data, including clinical notes and time-series data, often lack sufficient medical context that is important for making accurate clinical predictions. 
- Prior approaches to incorporating external knowledge graphs have focused only on extracting structured knowledge, neglecting the rich information in unstructured EHR data. They also face issues with content hallucination.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose REALM, a framework that enhances multimodal EHR representations by retrieving relevant medical knowledge using large language models (LLMs) in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach.

- REALM first encodes the clinical notes using LLMs and time-series data with GRUs. 

- It then prompts the LLM to extract medically relevant entities from the notes and matches them to a professionally labeled knowledge graph called PrimeKG. This eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency.

- The framework retrieves textual definitions and descriptions of the matched graph entities to incorporate broader medical knowledge.

- Finally, an adaptive fusion network integrates the retrieved knowledge with the original multimodal embeddings for the prediction tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Novel RAG-driven enhancement pipeline to extract entities from multimodal EHR data and match them to external knowledge graphs, preventing hallucinations.

- Technique to retrieve rich textual knowledge beyond simple triples or relationships from graphs to better capture medical semantics. 

- Adaptive fusion network to integrate retrieved knowledge with original EHR modalities.

- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-III mortality and readmission prediction tasks and robustness against data sparsity.

The paper makes important progress towards effectively harnessing multimodal EHR data and external knowledge for superior clinical predictions.
