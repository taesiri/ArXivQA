# [SGE: Structured Light System Based on Gray Code with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional structured light (SL) systems for depth estimation using frame-based cameras have limitations in speed (low frame rate) and efficiency (data redundancy). This prevents their use in high-speed dynamic scenes.
- Existing event-camera based SL systems using laser point projection suffer from timestamp noise and low encoding efficiency, limiting accuracy and speed.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a structured light system called SGE using a gray code pattern projected by a DLP projector and captured by an event camera.

Key Contributions:
- First work to introduce gray code patterns into event-based SL systems. Provides higher encoding efficiency and robustness to timestamp noise compared to laser point projection.

- Propose a simple yet highly accurate calibration method (SEC) for event-camera based SL systems with sub-pixel reprojection error.

- Introduce a GX-map disparity lookup scheme for fast disparity query, improving speed by 1000x.

- Use a time-overlapping strategy to maximize data utilization and speed for dynamic scenes.

- Achieve depth estimation speed of over 1000Hz with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art laser scanning methods.

- Provide high-speed dynamic scene dataset with both DLP and laser projector captures along with calibration data.

In summary, the paper proposes a high-speed gray code structured light system using an event camera that achieves significantly higher speed than prior arts while maintaining accuracy. The higher encoding efficiency, proposed calibration method, disparity lookup scheme and time-overlapping strategy are the main contributions enabling this advancement.

2. It presents a simple yet accurate calibration method (SEC) for event-based structured light systems that achieves sub-pixel level accuracy.

3. It introduces two techniques to improve the speed and data utilization of the system: the GX-map disparity query scheme for faster disparity calculation, and the Time-overlapping strategy to maximize data usage from the Gray code patterns. 

4. It demonstrates the system's ability to perform high-speed (over 1000Hz) and high-accuracy (millimeter-level) depth estimation on both static and dynamic scenes, surpassing prior event-based scanning methods in speed while maintaining accuracy.

5. It provides a dataset of static and high-speed dynamic scenes captured using the system, along with corresponding calibration data.
