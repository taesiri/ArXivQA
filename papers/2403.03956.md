# [Backtracing: Retrieving the Cause of the Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Content creators like lecturers want to improve their materials based on user feedback and questions, but it's hard to pinpoint what parts of the content triggered those questions.  
- Existing information retrieval systems are designed to satisfy users' information needs, not help content creators understand what causes user questions/confusion.
- The paper introduces a new task called "backtracing" to address this.

Proposed Solution:
- Formalize the task of backtracing: given a user query (e.g. student question) and corpus (e.g. lecture transcript), identify the sentence(s) in the corpus that likely caused the user to ask that query. 
- Introduce a diverse benchmark with 3 domains: Lecture, News Article, and Conversation. Each has real annotated examples of queries and context passages.
- Evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art neural retrieval methods on this benchmark in a zero-shot setting, including bi-encoder, re-ranking, likelihood models using PLMs like GPT, and ChatGPT.

Main Contributions:
- Define a novel and important task called backtracing to help content creators improve materials based on user queries
- Construct a challenging 3-domain benchmark dataset for this task  
- Systematically evaluate strength/weaknesses of existing methods, showing need for new techniques that understand causal relevance better
- Hope to drive progress on systems that empower content creators via better understanding triggers behind user questions

The key idea is that backtracing focuses specifically on the information needs of content creators rather than users/seekers, in order to improve content. The paper shows limitations of current techniques and establishes a benchmark to drive progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new information retrieval task called backtracing which aims to identify the part of a text corpus that likely caused a user's query, with the goal of helping content creators improve their materials.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new task called "backtracing" where the goal is to retrieve the text segment from a corpus that most likely provoked a given query. This addresses the information need of content creators who want to improve their content based on queries from information seekers.

2) Introducing a benchmark with three domains (lecture, news article, conversation) to establish the task of backtracing and highlight its broad applicability and common challenges. 

3) Evaluating a variety of existing retrieval methods on the backtracing benchmark, including similarity-based methods, likelihood-based methods, and ChatGPT. The results indicate there is room for improvement and that backtracing requires new approaches with better contextual understanding and reasoning about causal relevance.

4) Providing a foundation to improve future retrieval systems for the backtracing task, with the goal of helping content creators better understand user queries, refine content, and provide better user experiences.

In summary, the main contribution is formalizing the novel backtracing task, establishing a diverse benchmark to evaluate it, demonstrating limitations of current methods, and motivating the need for improved retrieval approaches that incorporate causal reasoning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Backtracing - The main task introduced in the paper, which involves retrieving the text segment that likely caused a user query.

- Causal relevance - An important concept in backtracing, referring to identifying the text content that provoked the query, rather than just finding semantically relevant text. 

- Content creators - The paper discusses how backtracing can help content creators like lecturers understand what parts of their content cause confusion or questions.

- Information seekers - Backtracing focuses on the needs of content creators rather than just information seekers. 

- Benchmark domains - The paper introduces benchmark datasets for backtracing in three domains: lectures, news articles, and conversations.

- Evaluation - The paper evaluates a variety of methods on backtracing such as bi-encoders, re-rankers, likelihood-based models, and ChatGPT.

- Limitations - The paper discusses limitations like the focus on single sentences, limited domains, and handling of long text.

- Causal inference - The paper draws inspiration from causal inference to introduce a likelihood-based retrieval method.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new task called "backtracing" - what is the key motivation behind this task and how is it different from existing information retrieval tasks? How does it address the needs of content creators vs information seekers?

2. The paper evaluates performance on 3 domains - lecture, news, and conversation. What are some key differences between these domains that make backtracing challenging? For example, differences in length of text, location of causes, similarity between query and cause etc.

3. The paper categorizes methods into similarity-based and likelihood-based. Can you explain the key differences in approach? Why might likelihood-based methods be more suitable for backtracing based on the definition of the task?

4. One of the likelihood-based methods is based on a causal inference technique called Average Treatment Effect (ATE). Explain how this statistical concept is adapted for the backtracing task. What are some limitations of this approach?  

5. The single-sentence likelihood method generally outperforms the autoregressive one except in the conversation domain. What unique properties of conversations could explain this result?

6. The paper concludes current retrieval methods have limitations for backtracing. Can you discuss 2-3 reasons why existing methods fall short? What new capabilities might be needed?  

7. The lecture domain relies on segmenting long transcripts because of model limitations. How might this impact performance of likelihood methods? What approaches could help handle long texts?

8. The paper focuses primarily on textual data for backtracing. When could incorporating multimodal data be beneficial? What modalities seem most relevant for each of the 3 domains?

9. The benchmark is English-centric currently. What are some challenges we could encounter when applying backtracing to other languages?

10. The paper acknowledges potential negative uses of identifying causes of user emotion. Can you expand on some ethical considerations for backtracing and how we can proactively address them?
