# [Backtracing: Retrieving the Cause of the Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Content creators like lecturers want to improve their materials based on user feedback and questions, but it's hard to pinpoint what parts of the content triggered those questions.  
- Existing information retrieval systems are designed to satisfy users' information needs, not help content creators understand what causes user questions/confusion.
- The paper introduces a new task called "backtracing" to address this.

Proposed Solution:
- Formalize the task of backtracing: given a user query (e.g. student question) and corpus (e.g. lecture transcript), identify the sentence(s) in the corpus that likely caused the user to ask that query. 
- Introduce a diverse benchmark with 3 domains: Lecture, News Article, and Conversation. Each has real annotated examples of queries and context passages.
- Evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art neural retrieval methods on this benchmark in a zero-shot setting, including bi-encoder, re-ranking, likelihood models using PLMs like GPT, and ChatGPT.

Main Contributions:
- Define a novel and important task called backtracing to help content creators improve materials based on user queries
- Construct a challenging 3-domain benchmark dataset for this task  
- Systematically evaluate strength/weaknesses of existing methods, showing need for new techniques that understand causal relevance better
- Hope to drive progress on systems that empower content creators via better understanding triggers behind user questions

The key idea is that backtracing focuses specifically on the information needs of content creators rather than users/seekers, in order to improve content. The paper shows limitations of current techniques and establishes a benchmark to drive progress.
