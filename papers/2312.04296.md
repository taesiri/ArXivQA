# [Cross-codex Learning for Reliable Scribe Identification in Medieval   Manuscripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04296)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper demonstrates the importance of cross-codex training data for reliable CNN-based text-independent off-line scribe identification of medieval manuscripts. Using a dataset of 25,200 lines across 7 scribes and 31 Carolingian codices, they show that preprocessing inputs as masked grayscale images instead of RGB clearly improves classification performance. Comparing CNN architectures, AlexNet provided the best tradeoff between accuracy (F1 scores up to 0.96 on line level) and efficiency. A key finding is that without cross-codex data, models learn codex-specific features rather than meaningful scribe characteristics. Implementing a reject option for low-confidence predictions further improved results. Overall, the authors reliably replicate paleographic expert assignments, even revealing likely labeling errors and making predictions on sections with unknown scribes. This demonstrates the feasibility of precise automatic scribe classification, enabling large-scale paleographic analysis for new insights into medieval scriptoria relationships and codex provenance.
