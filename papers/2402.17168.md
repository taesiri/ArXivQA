# [Benchmarking Data Science Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces DSEval, a novel evaluation paradigm and benchmarking framework designed specifically for assessing the capabilities of data science agents. Data science agents refer to AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) that can execute data analysis tasks through natural language instructions. 

The paper argues that existing benchmarking approaches are insufficient or inappropriate for evaluating data science agents. Some only test simple code completion abilities of LLMs while neglecting overall problem-solving capacities. Others conduct evaluations in a limited manner. DSEval addresses these gaps by enlarging the scope to cover the full lifecycle of agents' interactions during a data science session. This includes monitoring generated code quality, runtime execution behaviors, potential side effects on session contexts like unintentional data modifications, and more.

A key innovation proposed is incorporating LLMs themselves into a "bootstrapping annotation process" to automatically generate benchmarks, with humans providing subsequent refinements. This significantly reduces human labor and improves benchmark coverage and scalability compared to purely manual approaches. 

Based on DSEval, four diverse benchmarks are constructed: DSEval-Exercise, DSEval-SO, DSEval-LeetCode, and DSEval-Kaggle. Together they encompass 825 problems covering over 2200 API calls across 12 libraries. Analysis of the benchmarks and evaluation results on five popular data science agents provide useful findings. For instance, preserving data intactness and adhering to specified output formats remain challenging issues, while self-debugging techniques can effectively enhance performance especially for less capable models.

Overall, through its systematic evaluation approach spanning the entire workflow, expansive benchmark coverage, and revealing analysis, the paper makes notable contributions towards inspecting limitations of existing systems, establishing standard assessment protocols, and guiding future advancements in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces DSEval, a novel evaluation paradigm and benchmarks for assessing the performance of large language model-based data science agents throughout the data analysis lifecycle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing DSEval, a novel evaluation paradigm and benchmarking framework designed specifically for assessments of data science agents. The key aspects of DSEval include:

1) It enlarges the evaluation scope to cover the full lifecycle of LLM-based data science agents, going beyond just assessing the quality of generated code/analysis to also considering potential side effects.

2) It incorporates a bootstrapped annotation process to generate benchmarks, letting LLMs themselves create and annotate problem sets with human input. This significantly reduces human effort while improving coverage.

3) Based on DSEval, the paper constructs and analyzes four diverse benchmarks targeting different aspects of data science tasks. Evaluations of various agents on these benchmarks uncover common challenges and limitations to inform future research.

In summary, DSEval establishes a more comprehensive, scalable and informative evaluation methodology tailored for data science agents. The benchmarks and analysis provide useful insights into current progress and open problems in developing more reliable and effective agents.
