# [Local Agnostic Video Explanations: a Study on the Applicability of   Removal-Based Explanations to Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable AI techniques for deep learning models have gained importance, especially in computer vision. However, video explanation methods remain relatively unexplored due to the added complexity of the temporal dimension.
- Most current video explanation methods are model-specific, using techniques like backpropagation. There is a need to study model-agnostic, local explanations for video data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a unified framework for local agnostic video explanations by extending an existing image explanation framework. 
- Six explanation methods (LIME, Kernel SHAP, RISE, LOCO, Univariate Predictors, Occlusion Sensitivity) are adapted to work on videos by incorporating temporal information.
- The adaptation involves choices related to video segmentation, feature selection, removal and replacement, sample selection, model analysis, explanation summarization and visualization.

- Experiments were conducted using 3 networks (TimeSformer, TANet, TPN) and 2 datasets (Kinetics 400, EtriActivity3D) for diversity.

Main Contributions:

1. A refined framework for removal-based video explanations with tailored choices for vision data.

2. Adaptation of six methods (3D LIME, 3D Kernel SHAP etc.) to generate local explanations on videos, with comparisons to existing approaches.

3. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of adapted methods using automated metrics and user studies. 

4. Analysis of the impact of key choices in the explanation pipeline on explanation quality. Allows refinements based on datasets/models.

5. Found 3D RISE, 3D LIME and 3D Kernel SHAP to generate superior explanations according to both automated and user evaluations.

In summary, the paper significantly advances research on interpretable video recognition by proposing and evaluating adapted explanation methods within a systematic framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a unified framework for generating local agnostic explanations for video data by adapting existing removal-based explanation techniques, evaluates six such adapted methods using automated metrics and user studies, and finds 3D RISE, 3D LIME, and 3D Kernel SHAP yield the best explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. A refined, fine-grained unified framework for explaining model predictions, building upon the framework presented in [1]. This framework is tailored for computer vision by adapting it for video data and introducing additional choices specific to visual data.

2. An adaptation of six well-established explainability techniques (LIME, Kernel SHAP, RISE, LOCO, Univariate Predictors, Occlusion Sensitivity) to the video domain. Each technique is modified to accommodate visual input data, including the temporal dimension, and to provide local explanations. 

3. A comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the explanations generated by each adapted explainability method, involving diverse models and datasets to robustly assess their overall performance. Both automated metrics and user-based evaluation are used.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a unified framework for local agnostic video explanations, adapting existing image explanation methods to video, and conducting a thorough evaluation to compare the adapted methods.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords associated with it are:

Explainable artificial intelligence, Action recognition, Deep learning, Computer vision

These keywords are listed explicitly in the paper under the abstract section. Explainable artificial intelligence refers to techniques for understanding and interpreting machine learning models, especially complex "black box" models like deep neural networks. Action recognition involves classifying human actions in video data using computer vision techniques. Deep learning consists of neural network models with multiple layers that can learn hierarchical representations. And computer vision is the broader field of automatically analyzing visual data like images and video using computers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a unified framework for local agnostic explanations in the video domain. What are the key components and choices involved in this framework? How does it compare to the framework proposed by Covert et al. for removal-based explanations?

2. Six explanation methods (3D LIME, 3D Kernel SHAP, 3D RISE, LV LOCO, LV Univariate Predictors, 3D Sampled Occlusion Sensitivity) were adapted to work on video data. For each method, what adjustments were made to incorporate the temporal dimension of videos? What are the pros and cons of each adapted method? 

3. The paper employs three distinct neural network models (TimeSformer, TANet, TPN) and two datasets (Kinetics 400, EtriActivity3D) with different characteristics. How do the choice of model and dataset impact the evaluation and comparison of explanation methods? What factors contribute to the variations observed?

4. Two evaluation approaches, automatic metrics and user-based scoring, were utilized to assess explanation quality. What are the relative merits and limitations of each approach? What new insights can be gained by employing both strategies? 

5. For the automatic evaluation, AUC and Minimal Explanation Mask metrics were computed. Analyze and compare the results of different explanation methods on these metrics. Are there any discrepancies between the metrics in terms of best performing methods?

6. The user-based evaluation revealed certain preferences regarding explanation types. What visual aspects, such as smoothness, appeared to influence user scoring? How can this inform efforts to refine explanation methods?

7. The 3D RISE method was favored by users but involved greater computational expenses. What strategies could optimize the efficiency of this method without compromising on explanation quality? Would these be generalizable to other methods?

8. The framework introduced enables studying the impact of choices at each explanation stage. What are some important factors to investigate regarding segmentation, feature selection, removal techniques etc.? How could this lead to refinements? 

9. Certain methods like LV Univariate Predictors demonstrated suboptimal performance. What are some potential reasons for this? How can perturbations and samples be optimized to enhance results?

10. The study demonstrates combining multiple evaluation approaches to rigorously assess explanation methods. What other quantitative and qualitative techniques could lend further insights into judging explanation quality? What metrics could be proposed?
