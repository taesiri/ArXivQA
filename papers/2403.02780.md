## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on developing an optimized collaboration function for the Non-Readily Identifiable Data Collaboration (NRI-DC) framework, a privacy-preserving machine learning approach that enables multiple entities with sensitive datasets to jointly train a model without sharing raw data. 

The problem addressed is that existing methods for formulating the collaboration function in NRI-DC often exhibit theoretical gaps, resulting in unstable performance of the trained models. The research question guiding this work is whether a collaboration function can be developed that is both robust and efficient, enhancing model performance and stability while adhering to computational efficiency constraints and the non-iterative communication and privacy guarantees of NRI-DC.

The paper proposes using optimization formulations over matrix manifolds, focusing on maximizing structure retention in the intermediate representations generated from the raw sensitive data. Two approaches are introduced - one using orthogonal matrix manifolds with Procrustean analysis methods, and one using full-rank manifolds with Riemannian optimization techniques.

The orthogonal matrix manifold formulation leverages the well-established Orthogonal Procrustes Problem to align intermediate representations while strictly maintaining geometric relationships from the original data. The full-rank manifold formulation applies a smooth rank-deficiency penalty term to allow more flexibility in minimizing alignment error between representations if needed.

Through empirical analysis on three public datasets, the orthogonal Procrustes solution is found to excel, enhancing model performance consistently with efficiency. The paper concludes that this method effectively addresses the research question, improving collaboration function functionality and stability without compromising efficiency or privacy assurances of NRI-DC.

The main contributions are (i) a novel and theoretically grounded formulation for the NRI-DC collaboration function focusing on structure retention, (ii) introduction of practical and efficient solutions using Procrustean analysis and Riemannian optimization methods, and (iii) experimental validation demonstrating stable and superior performance compared to existing approaches.
