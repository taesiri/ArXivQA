# [DeepCSHAP: Utilizing Shapley Values to Explain Deep Complex-Valued   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks are being widely used across various applications including safety-critical ones like healthcare and autonomous driving. However, their lack of interpretability poses risks and hinders adoption. Many methods have been proposed to explain real-valued neural networks, but no methods exist to explain complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) which deal with complex-valued input data directly without projection onto the reals. This is an important gap since CVNNs show superior performance on various complex-valued data like MRI images, satellite data, etc.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes multiple methods to explain CVNNs:

1) Adaptations of 4 gradient-based explanation methods like Guided Backpropagation and Integrated Gradients to the complex domain using Wirtinger calculus. 

2) A complex-valued version of DeepSHAP called DeepCSHAP, which computes Shapley values propagating them through layers using a novel complex-valued chain rule. This required non-trivial proofs of properties like missingness and consistency in the complex domain.

3) An algorithm called MaxCSHAP to compute contributions of complex max pooling layers for use in DeepCSHAP.

Key Contributions:

1) First work on explaining CVNNs through gradient-based and SHAP-based methods adapted to handle complex numbers.

2) DeepCSHAP method with supporting theory like the complex chain rule, along with proofs of consistency properties.

3) Evaluation of all methods on MNIST and complex satellite imagery, showing DeepCSHAP's superior performance in identifying influential features.

4) Open-source library implementing all the explanation methods.

Overall, this paper fills an important gap in the interpretability of CVNNs by proposing both gradient and SHAP-based explanation techniques tailored for complex numbers. DeepCSHAP outperforms other methods and provides a way forward for safely using CVNNs in critical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops and evaluates an adaptation of the DeepSHAP algorithm for explaining complex-valued neural networks, called DeepCSHAP, along with adaptations of several gradient-based explanation methods, providing the first set of interpretability techniques tailored for complex-valued models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The development of a complex-valued DeepSHAP algorithm, including proving a complex-valued chain rule to enable propagating contributions through layers. This allows explaining complex-valued neural networks using the SHAP framework.

2. The adaptation of four gradient based explanation methods (Gradient, Gradient*Input, Guided Backpropagation, Integrated Gradients) to the complex domain, providing baseline methods to compare against DeepCSHAP. 

3. An evaluation of the explanation quality of DeepCSHAP and the adapted gradient methods on two datasets - the real-valued MNIST dataset and a complex-valued PolSAR dataset. The experiments show DeepCSHAP outperforming the other methods.

4. A validation of theoretical results, including the Missingness and Local Accuracy properties of the DeepCSHAP explanations.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of the first explanation method specifically for complex-valued neural networks - DeepCSHAP - which is shown experimentally and theoretically to provide high quality explanations for this type of neural network architecture.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:
