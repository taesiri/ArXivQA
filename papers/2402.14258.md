# [Eagle: Ethical Dataset Given from Real Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14258)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing datasets for evaluating ethical issues in large language models (LLMs) like biases and toxicity are intentionally created and may not reflect real issues that arise when people use LLM services. This limits developing safe LLMs. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors create a new dataset called Eagle extracted from real English interactions between ChatGPT and users exhibiting social bias, opinion bias, toxic language, and morality issues.

- The Eagle dataset contains 2,317 instances over these categories, using longer, more complex contexts from actual conversations compared to existing datasets. It leverages prompt engineering to elicit unethical LLM outputs.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis shows existing datasets have very low correlation for evaluating ethical issues compared to the Eagle dataset, indicating they do not capture real-world concerns.

- Using the Eagle dataset as few-shot examples is far more effective at mitigating unethical LLM outputs versus existing datasets, while not impairing performance on neutral instances.

- A human evaluation shows over 80% of Eagle dataset instances are appropriately labeled for social bias, opinion bias, toxic language, and morality problems.

In summary, the Eagle dataset based on real ChatGPT conversations provides a more practical way to evaluate and mitigate ethical issues with LLMs versus existing synthetic datasets. The paper demonstrates the deficiencies of current datasets on reflecting real-world ethical concerns in LLM services.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces the Eagle dataset, extracted from real English interactions between ChatGPT and users, which exhibits social bias, opinion bias, toxic language, and morality problems not reflected in existing ethical datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of the Eagle dataset, which contains real-world examples of problematic interactions between ChatGPT and users that exhibit issues like social bias, toxicity, and immorality. 

Specifically, the Eagle dataset consists of over 2,000 instances extracted from logs of actual conversations between ChatGPT and users. The authors show through experiments that existing datasets for evaluating ethical issues in language models do not correlate well with the Eagle dataset and are not as effective for mitigating problematic outputs when used as few-shot examples. 

The key findings are:

- The Eagle dataset captures complementary ethical issues not covered by current datasets that are intentionally created for evaluating language model ethics.

- There is a lack of correlation in evaluation scores between the Eagle dataset and other existing datasets for social bias, opinion bias, toxicity, and morality.

- Using instances from existing datasets for few-shot learning is not as effective at mitigating problematic language model outputs on the Eagle dataset compared to using the Eagle dataset itself.

So in summary, the main contribution is the introduction of this new real-world dataset that exposes ethical gaps not reflected in current synthetic evaluation benchmarks, along with analysis demonstrating those gaps.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Eagle dataset - The new dataset proposed in the paper, extracted from real English interactions between ChatGPT and users that exhibit social bias, opinion bias, toxic language, and morality problems.

- Ethical datasets - Existing datasets used for evaluating and mitigating ethical issues in language models, such as BBQ, Opinion QA, ToxiGen, and MoCa. 

- Social bias - One of the ethical issues covered in the Eagle dataset, referring to unfair stereotyping and generalizations about groups.

- Opinion bias - Another ethical issue in the Eagle dataset, referring to alignment of model's opinions with human opinions.

- Toxic language - Unethical language exhibiting hostility, prejudice, or harassment towards others. The Eagle dataset contains instances of toxic language.

- Morality - Issues related to right vs wrong judgments and moral reasoning. The Eagle dataset covers morality problems.  

- Likelihood-based score (LLS) - A proposed evaluation measure to quantify model's tendency to generate unethical text. 

- Few-shot learning - Using a small number of examples to teach models to avoid generating unethical text. Experiments in the paper use few-shot learning for mitigating issues in the Eagle dataset.

- Prompt engineering - Techniques to elicit unethical text from models, used in constructing the Eagle dataset.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed Eagle dataset, existing ethical datasets, types of ethical issues analyzed, evaluation measures proposed, and techniques used for mitigation and dataset collection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper extracts instances from real-world logs of conversations between ChatGPT and users. What are some potential issues with using this data, compared to intentionally created ethical datasets? For example, could the distribution of issues be skewed based on user interests and behaviors?

2. The paper uses a two-step classification process with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to identify unethical instances. What are the tradeoffs of this approach compared to using a single model? Could errors compound between the two steps?  

3. The likelihood-based evaluation measure (LLS) quantifies models' propensity to generate unethical text. How might this metric fall short in fully evaluating ethical issues compared to human judgment? Are there ethical concerns it may not capture well?

4. For few-shot learning, only a subset of the annotated instances are used rather than all of them. What is the rationale behind this decision? Could using more instances further improve mitigation performance? What are the limitations?

5. The analysis shows that few-shot learning with Eagle better retains performance on neutral instances compared to existing datasets. Why might this be the case? Does it indicate the instances better match real-world distributions?

6. The paper focuses only on English language data due to limitations in dataset sizes for other languages. What techniques could help create multilingual versions of this dataset in the future? What challenges might that introduce?

7. The human evaluation results show the dataset labels are 80-90% accurate. What could account for the errors? Would a higher accuracy be needed for reliable use of the dataset?

8. The paper does not annotate additional attributes or explain unethical aspects of instances. How could adding these details improve the usefulness of the dataset for understanding ethical issues?

9. The dataset extracts instances only from ChatGPT. How might conversations from other services like Claude or Gemini differ? Would the dataset methodology work there?

10. The dataset currently focuses on social bias, opinion bias, toxicity, and morality. What other ethical issues around AI systems could be extracted and analyzed with a similar approach in the future?
