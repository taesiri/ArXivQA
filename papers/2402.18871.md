# [LoLiSRFlow: Joint Single Image Low-light Enhancement and   Super-resolution via Cross-scale Transformer-based Conditional Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Real-world images captured in low-light environments usually suffer from two types of degradation - low resolution and poor visibility. Existing methods address these issues through low-light enhancement (LLE) and super-resolution (SR) separately. However, cascading these task-specific methods fails to effectively solve the joint low-light low-resolution problem, often resulting in noise amplification, loss of details, and artifacts.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a conditional normalizing flow network called LoLiSRFlow to learn the distribution of normal-light high-resolution images conditioned on low-light low-resolution inputs. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a resolution- and illumination-invariant color ratio map as a prior that represents the intrinsic color and texture distribution consistently across resolutions and illumination levels. 

2) Design a multi-resolution parallel transformer encoder to extract this invariant map from the input.

3) Construct an invertible network based on normalizing flows to map high-resolution well-exposed images to a latent distribution.

4) Jointly optimize a negative log-likelihood loss and L1 reconstruction loss to train the network.

During inference, sampling the color ratio map gives the optimal high-resolution reconstructed image through the invertible network.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes LoLiSRFlow - the first conditional normalizing flow framework to address joint low-light enhancement and SR by modeling output distributions.

2) Designs a multi-scale transformer encoder and uses a novel resolution- and illumination-invariant map as a prior.

3) Introduces DFSR-LLE, a new synthetic dataset with 7100 image pairs and realistic noise models for the joint problem.

4) Shows state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on DFSR-LLE and real-world datasets. Effectively handles issues like noise, loss of details, and artifacts.
