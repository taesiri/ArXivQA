# [Excuse me, sir? Your language model is leaking (information)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) has become very difficult. This raises concerns about potential misuse of LLMs.
- Existing methods alter the distribution of LLM responses to plant a detectable watermark. This degrades text quality.
- The paper introduces a method to hide a secret payload in LLM responses without altering the distribution at all.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a secret key to correlate the LLM's randomness with the payload, similar to a recent undetectable watermarking scheme.
- Break the payload into smaller pieces and encode each piece separately using an error correcting code, to improve efficiency. 
- Use a dynamic error correcting code that allows decoding an arbitrary prefix of the payload from a prefix of the encoded message.
- Empirically verify the scheme can hide a number of bits linear in the LLM response length.

Main Contributions:
- First cryptographic scheme for provably undetectable steganography in LLM responses. The distribution of responses and quality of text is unaffected.
- Asymptotically optimal rate of hiding bits linear in the LLM response length, under assumptions on entropy satisfied by natural language.  
- Introduction of a dynamic error correcting code used as a building block in the scheme.
- Empirical evaluation confirming linear scaling on actual LLM responses and analysis of an example decoding.

The paper provides the first information-theoretically secure construction for hiding a payload in LLM responses without altering distribution, analyzes limits on robustness to edits, and leaves open optimizing the concrete parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a method to secretly encode arbitrary information in the responses of large language models, in an undetectable manner that provably does not affect the quality or distribution of generated text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an undetectable steganography scheme for large language models. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a cryptographic method to hide an arbitrary secret payload in the response of a large language model, without modifying the response distribution at all. A secret key is required to extract the payload.

- The scheme extends a recent undetectable watermarking scheme, and transforms it to instead embed arbitrary messages. This is done using a dynamic error correcting code construction.

- The scheme encodes a number of bits that is linear in the length of the language model's response. This encoding rate is shown to be asymptotically optimal.

- Undetectability holds even if an adversary makes many adaptive queries to the model. The quality or distribution of the language model's responses is formally proven to not be affected by the presence of the hidden payload.

- The scheme is analyzed rigorously and implemented to provide a proof-of-concept. Potential limitations regarding robustness to editing are discussed, and improving this is posed as an open problem.

In summary, the main contribution is formally defining steganography for language models, providing a construction, and proving that a secret payload can be embedded efficiently without modifying the distribution of responses at all.

The paper introduces a cryptographic method to hide an arbitrary secret payload in the responses of a large language model, without modifying the response distribution. Key properties shown are undetectability (inability to distinguish responses with and without payloads) and ability to successfully retrieve the payload using a secret key. The method builds upon an existing undetectable watermarking scheme and incorporates techniques like dynamic error correcting codes and pseudorandom functions. The payload encoding rate compared to empirical entropy of responses is analyzed, along with an empirical evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper defines "undetectability" as making it computationally infeasible to distinguish between responses from the original model and responses generated using the steganography scheme, without knowledge of the secret key. What are the formal assumptions and security reductions used to prove this property?

2. The scheme uses a dynamic error correcting code that allows decoding an arbitrary prefix of the payload from a prefix of the transmitted codeword. What is the rate and error correction capability of this code? How does it exploit the noiseless feedback channel?

3. The detection threshold "t" is set based on an analysis balancing false positives and false negatives. What is the dependence of this threshold on parameters like the security parameter and response length? How can it be optimized?  

4. The scheme embeds one bit of the payload per O(1) tokens of response. Can this rate be further improved by using different scoring functions, non-binary codes, optimizing constants, or other methods?

5. The empirical evaluation shows a linear relationship between response length and embedded payload. However, what is the dependence on model entropy? How does performance vary across different models?  

6. The scheme partitions response generation into collecting entropy, watermarking, and payload embedding phases. What is the purpose of each? Could any phases be simplified or combined?

7. How exactly does the scheme extend from single-query to multi-query undetectability? What prevents collision of inputs to the PRF across queries?

8. What types of edits to the response could remove the embedded payload? What is the weakest edit model under which undetectable steganography can be made robust? 

9. Could the error correcting code be improved to allow decoding from arbitrary corrupted substrings rather than just prefixes? Would this improve robustness?

10. How does the entropy requirement on model responses compare to empirical measurements in natural language? Could assumptions be relaxed by using different scoring methods?
