# [Unlocking Efficiency in Large Language Model Inference: A Comprehensive   Survey of Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unlocking Efficiency in Large Language Model Inference: A Comprehensive Survey of Speculative Decoding":

Problem:
- Inference latency has emerged as a major bottleneck restricting the applications of large language models (LLMs), primarily due to the token-by-token generation necessitated by autoregressive decoding. 
- Each decoding step is highly memory bandwidth bound, resulting in low hardware utilization and inefficient inference.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Speculative Decoding, a novel decoding paradigm that accelerates LLM inference by first efficiently drafting multiple future tokens per step, and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM.

- Two key components:
   - Drafting: An efficient drafter model first predicts multiple future tokens. Strategies include using smaller LMs, lightweight heads, early exiting, etc.
   - Verification: The target LLM then verifies the drafted tokens in parallel based on the probability distribution comparison. Only tokens meeting the criterion are accepted.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a formal definition and formulation of the Speculative Decoding paradigm.
- Offers an in-depth analysis of various techniques for drafting, verification, and alignment between the drafter and target LLM.
- Summarizes promising application scenarios where Speculative Decoding demonstrates extraordinary effectiveness. 
- Outlines current challenges and highlights future research directions in this field.
- Presents the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reviewing Speculative Decoding literature and clarifying the research landscape.

In summary, the paper systematically reviews Speculative Decoding as a promising decoding paradigm to accelerate LLM inference without changing the output distribution. It serves as an essential guide for future research on efficient LLM inference.
