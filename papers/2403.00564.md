# [EfficientZero V2: Mastering Discrete and Continuous Control with Limited   Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically require large amounts of interaction data with environments to learn effective policies. This limits their applicability to real-world problems where interactions are expensive. Therefore, developing sample-efficient RL algorithms that can learn from limited environmental interactions is an important challenge.

Existing algorithms have made strides towards improving sample efficiency, but none have been able to consistently achieve superior performance across diverse domains encompassing discrete/continuous actions, visual/low-dimensional inputs, etc. There is a need for a general RL framework that demonstrates both high performance and sample efficiency across domains.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes EfficientZero-v2 (EZ-V2), which enhances EfficientZero to achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across discrete and continuous control domains. 

The key components of EZ-V2 include:
1) Learned environment model for planning
2) Sampling-based Gumbel tree search for policy improvement in continuous spaces 
3) Search-based value estimation to better utilize old transitions
4) Mixed value target combining multi-step TD and search-based targets  

The sampling-based Gumbel search uses a subset of sampled actions from the policy and an exploration distribution for tree simulations. This provides excellent exploration capabilities while satisfying the policy improvement guarantee.

The search-based value estimation leverages the model and latest policy to estimate values of historical transitions through tree search. This gives more accurate targets compared to conventional multi-step methods. 

The mixed value target switches between multi-step TD and search-based targets based on model accuracy and data staleness to balance accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes EZ-V2 as a general, state-of-the-art sample efficient RL algorithm applicable across domains 
- Demonstrates superiority over existing methods like DreamerV3 in 66 diverse tasks encompassing Atari, continuous control, visual inputs, etc.
- Introduces sampling-based Gumbel search for policy improvement in continuous action spaces along with proofs
- Develops search-based value estimation and proves an upper bound on its error 

The consistent sample efficiency of EZ-V2 represents a notable advancement towards real-world applicability of RL algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 EfficientZero V2 proposes a general framework for sample-efficient reinforcement learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains encompassing discrete/continuous control and visual/low-dimensional inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing EfficientZero V2 (EZ-V2), a general framework for sample-efficient reinforcement learning that achieves consistent sample efficiency for discrete and continuous control, as well as visual and low-dimensional inputs.
