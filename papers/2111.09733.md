# [Perceiving and Modeling Density is All You Need for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09733)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is: How can we effectively model the uneven distribution of haze in real-world hazy images to improve single image dehazing? The key hypotheses are:1) The uneven distribution of haze in real images can be better modeled by perceiving the haze density and encoding it spatially. 2) Explicitly modeling the haze density using a density map can help refine image features and improve dehazing performance.3) An efficient attention mechanism (SHA) can help perceive the haze density information from features.4) A coarse-to-fine architecture using density modeling can improve generalization on real hazy images.The authors propose a network architecture and training strategy based on these hypotheses to achieve state-of-the-art performance on single image dehazing, demonstrating their effectiveness. The core novelty lies in explicitly modeling haze density for the task.
