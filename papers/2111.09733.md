# [Perceiving and Modeling Density is All You Need for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09733)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is: How can we effectively model the uneven distribution of haze in real-world hazy images to improve single image dehazing? The key hypotheses are:1) The uneven distribution of haze in real images can be better modeled by perceiving the haze density and encoding it spatially. 2) Explicitly modeling the haze density using a density map can help refine image features and improve dehazing performance.3) An efficient attention mechanism (SHA) can help perceive the haze density information from features.4) A coarse-to-fine architecture using density modeling can improve generalization on real hazy images.The authors propose a network architecture and training strategy based on these hypotheses to achieve state-of-the-art performance on single image dehazing, demonstrating their effectiveness. The core novelty lies in explicitly modeling haze density for the task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel Separable Hybrid Attention (SHA) module to efficiently perceive the uneven distribution of haze density in images. 2. It introduces a density map to explicitly model the uneven haze distribution and refine features. The density map is obtained in an end-to-end manner.3. It designs a new network architecture for image dehazing that utilizes the SHA module and density map. The network restores images in a coarse-to-fine manner using shallow layers to reconstruct high-level content and deep layers to reconstruct details.4. Extensive experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming previous methods by a large margin quantitatively and qualitatively.In summary, the key innovation is the proposed SHA module and density map to perceive and model haze density for uneven haze distribution. The overall network architecture effectively leverages these components for high-quality image dehazing.
