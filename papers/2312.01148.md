# [Has Anything Changed? 3D Change Detection by 2D Segmentation Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Has Anything Changed? 3D Change Detection by 2D Segmentation Masks":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of unsupervised 3D object discovery in indoor scenes given two scans captured at different times. The goal is to detect changes between the scans to identify moved, added or removed objects without any prior knowledge of the objects in the scene. This is challenging due to noise, lack of training data, small changes often missed, and varying illumination. Prior render-and-compare methods often miss small changes and don't discover full objects.

Method:
The paper proposes a novel method that combines 3D change detection and 2D segmentation. First, an initial set of changing points is detected between aligned scans via depth render-and-compare. As this provides incomplete object detections, a graph optimization propagates changes using connectivity expressed in 2D segmentation masks from SAM. This "segmentation mask constraint" assigns each 3D point the most frequent mask of its projecting pixels. The optimization then propagates change from initial detections to all regions sharing a mask, thereby segmenting full changed objects.

Contributions:
(1) An unsupervised 3D object discovery method leveraging 2D segmentation masks to refine incomplete change detections and segment full objects.
(2) Introduction of a "segmentation mask constraint" for change propagation, based on latest 2D pre-trained models, instead of photoconsistency or geometric constraints.
(3) Significantly improved performance on the 3RScan dataset over state-of-the-art methods for 3D change detection.

The key insight is that 2D segmentation masks from generic pre-trained models can better identify object connectivity for propagating sparse 3D change detections to full objects, without needing predefined object knowledge. Experiments validate the method achieves state-of-the-art recall for changed object discovery.
