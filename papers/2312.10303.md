# [Online Restless Multi-Armed Bandits with Long-Term Fairness Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10303)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, which is used to model sequential decision making under constraints. In the basic RMAB model, there are N "arms" (options to choose from), each following a Markov decision process (MDP). At each time step, the decision maker can activate up to B arms based on their states, with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. However, this model does not provide any fairness guarantees in how activations are distributed among the arms over time. 

To address this, the paper introduces a new RMAB model called RMAB-F that imposes additional "long-term fairness constraints". Specifically, it requires that each arm n must be activated for at least a minimum fraction ηn of time steps in the long run. The goal now is to maximize long-term rewards while satisfying both a constraint on instantaneous activations per time step, and long-term fairness constraints.

Proposed Solution:
The paper focuses on the online setting where the MDPs of the arms are initially unknown. It develops a reinforcement learning algorithm called Fair-UCRL to solve this online RMAB-F problem. Fair-UCRL has two key features:

1. It provides a probabilistic sublinear bound on both the reward regret (loss in rewards due to lack of knowledge of MDPs) and fairness violation regret (loss in long-term fairness) that holds with high probability.

2. It is computationally efficient, leveraging an index policy for decision making instead of solving complicated Bellman equations. This allows satisfying instantaneous activation constraints.

Main Contributions:

1. Introduces a new RMAB model with long-term fairness constraints (RMAB-F) and formalizes the online learning problem.

2. Develops a novel RL algorithm, Fair-UCRL, with order-optimal regret bounds on both reward and fairness violation.

3. Fair-UCRL uses an efficient index policy for decisions that provably meets instantaneous activation constraints.

4. Experiments on real-world applications demonstrate Fair-UCRL's effectiveness in balancing maximizing rewards and providing fairness guarantees.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in constrained RMAB problems by formalizing and providing an efficient learning algorithm for RMAB with long-term fairness guarantees. The performance is supported by theoretical regret analysis and empirical evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, Fair-UCRL, with sublinear reward and fairness violation regrets for the online restless multi-armed bandit problem with long-term fairness constraints, leveraging an efficient index policy for decision making.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) model called RMAB with long-term fairness constraints (FRMAB). This model imposes additional long-term fairness constraints on the activation of arms compared to the conventional RMAB. 

2. It develops a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Fair-UCRL for the online FRMAB setting where the underlying MDPs are unknown. This algorithm provides probabilistic sublinear bounds on both the reward regret and fairness violation regret. It is also computationally efficient by leveraging a low-complexity index policy.

3. It conducts regret analysis to characterize the bounds on reward regret and fairness violation regret achieved by Fair-UCRL. This is the first such analysis for online FRMAB problems.

4. It introduces another algorithm called G-Fair-UCRL that greedily enforces fairness constraints and has no fairness violation regret. Regret bounds are provided for this algorithm too.

5. It validates the proposed algorithms on several real-world applications related to resource allocation and healthcare. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the new FRMAB model, developing efficient learning algorithms for it, providing regret analysis, and demonstrating empirical performance. The algorithms, analysis and evaluations on this new problem formulation are the key contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB): A model for sequential decision making problems with constraints where arms evolve independently as Markov decision processes.

- Long-term fairness constraints: A minimum long-term activation fraction requirement imposed on each arm to ensure fairness.

- Online setting: The setting where the underlying MDPs of the arms are unknown and must be learned.

- Reward regret: The suboptimality in cumulative reward compared to the optimal policy. 

- Fairness violation regret: The suboptimality in satisfying long-term fairness constraints.

- Optimistic planning: Constructing confidence sets for transition probabilities and rewards, solving an extended linear program for an optimistic policy.

- Policy execution: Executing an index policy derived from the optimistic planning that satisfies instantaneous constraints.  

- Computationally efficient: The algorithm has low complexity compared to solving full Bellman equations repeatedly.

- Sublinear regret bounds: The algorithm achieves probabilistic bounds on both reward and fairness violation regrets that scale as Õ(√T).

So in summary, key concepts are around extending RMAB with long-term fairness guarantees, analyzing regret in an online learning setting, and developing efficient learning algorithms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new RL algorithm named \fairucrl for the online \frmab problem. How does \fairucrl modify the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty compared to conventional UCRL algorithms to account for both maximizing long-term rewards and satisfying long-term fairness constraints?

2. A key theoretical contribution of this paper is providing the first probabilistic sublinear bounds on both the reward regret and fairness violation regret for online \frmab problems. What are the key proof techniques used to establish these regret bounds, especially for bounding the fairness violation regret? 

3. The paper claims \fairucrl is computationally efficient compared to other RL methods for \rmab problems. What specific design aspect of \fairucrl enables this efficiency and how does this differ from other RL algorithms?

4. The \fair index policy is critical to ensuring \fairucrl meets the instantaneous activation constraint at each decision epoch. How is this index policy derived and what properties ensure it can satisfy this constraint?  

5. How does the extended LP formulation in \fairucrl differ from the LP for the relaxed \frmab problem? What role do the state-action-state occupancy measures play here?

6. What practical scenarios or applications motivate studying \frmab problems with long-term fairness constraints? How might the guarantees provided by \fairucrl be beneficial in those settings?

7. The paper discusses how neither conventional Whittle index policies nor recent RL methods for online \rmab can provide the fairness guarantees needed for \frmab problems. Elaborate on the specific limitations of those methods in ensuring fairness.  

8. What assumptions are made about the underlying MDPs in the theoretical analysis of \fairucrl? How might violations of those assumptions impact the performance guarantees or regret bounds?

9. The greedy exploration phase in \gfairucrl explicitly enforces meeting the fairness constraints in each episode. What are the tradeoffs of this greedy approach compared to the long-term probabilistic guarantees provided by \fairucrl?

10. How do the techniques used for analyzing the asymptotic optimality and verifying the global attractor property of the \fair index policy extend or differ from similar analysis in prior \rmab literature?
