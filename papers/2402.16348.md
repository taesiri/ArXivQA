# [Star-Searcher: A Complete and Efficient Aerial System for Autonomous   Target Search in Complex Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenging problem of autonomous target search using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex unknown environments. Compared to autonomous exploration which focuses on mapping free and occupied spaces, target search requires simultaneously exploring unknown areas and thoroughly inspecting occupied spaces where targets may exist. This poses significant challenges in ensuring search completeness without compromising efficiency. Currently, there is a lack of systematic approaches tailored for efficient and complete autonomous aerial target search.

Method: 
The paper presents Star-Searcher, an aerial system with specialized sensor suites, mapping, and planning modules designed specifically for the task. To address path planning challenges arising from increased inspection requirements, a hierarchical planner supported by a visibility-based viewpoint clustering method is introduced. Viewpoint clustering groups viewpoints separated by obstacles and aggregates mutually visible ones, providing implicit regional guidance to simplify planning into global and local sub-problems. Global path planning determines the order for visiting different regions while local path planning efficiently covers the viewpoints within each region. Furthermore, global planning incorporates a history-aware mechanism, utilizing previous path information to prevent motion inconsistency from frequent map changes during replanning.  

Contributions:
1) An aerial system enabling seamless exploration and inspection to achieve fast and complete target search in complex scenes.

2) A hierarchical planning approach enhanced by visibility-based viewpoint clustering. This decomposes the complex planning task into more tractable global and local sub-problems with fewer detours.  

3) A history-aware mechanism for global replanning that maintains consistency between consecutive paths by considering previous visiting tendencies, enhancing search efficiency.

Experiments in simulation and the real-world demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with shorter flight paths, time, and higher completeness. The system and source code will be open-sourced.
