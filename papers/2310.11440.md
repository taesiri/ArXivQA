# [EvalCrafter: Benchmarking and Evaluating Large Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11440)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we comprehensively and fairly evaluate the performance of large text-to-video generative models?

The authors argue that current evaluation methods for text-to-video models are limited, relying on just a few academic metrics like FVD or IS that only measure distributional similarities to real videos. They propose that a more exhaustive evaluation is needed to properly assess the multi-aspect capabilities of these large generative models trained on huge datasets. 

To address this question, the paper introduces a new framework and pipeline for benchmarking and evaluating text-to-video models across different dimensions like visual quality, text-video alignment, motion quality, temporal consistency, etc. The key aspects are:

- Constructing a diverse benchmark prompt set by analyzing real-world prompts and using a language model to expand the prompts. 

- Proposing around 18 objective metrics to evaluate different aspects of the generated videos.

- Conducting user studies to collect human opinions on quality. 

- Training coefficients to align the objective metrics with user opinions to get an overall score that better correlates with human judgment.

Through this comprehensive evaluation approach, the paper aims to provide more meaningful insights into the capabilities of different text-to-video models beyond what existing limited metrics can offer. The goal is a more fair, reliable and robust assessment methodology for this class of generative models.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework and benchmark called EvalCrafter to comprehensively evaluate large text-to-video generation models using multiple metrics across different aspects like video quality, text-video alignment, motion quality, and temporal consistency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text-to-video generation and evaluation:

- The paper proposes a new benchmark and framework (EvalCrafter) for evaluating text-to-video models more comprehensively across different aspects like video quality, text-video alignment, motion quality, etc. This is novel compared to prior work that usually only looks at a few metrics like FVD or IS. The multi-aspect evaluation provides a more holistic assessment.

- The paper analyzes real-world text prompts for text-to-video generation to inform the design of the benchmark prompts. This helps ensure the evaluation reflects real use cases and distributions. Other benchmarks often use more synthetic or simplified prompts. 

- The paper incorporates both objective metrics and human evaluations/alignments in the benchmark. Integrating human judgments provides a useful gauge of quality beyond just objective metrics. Other benchmarks are typically more focused just on objective metrics.

- The set of metrics considered is quite comprehensive, covering not just overall video quality but also specific attributes like motion quality, temporal consistency, etc. Many prior benchmarks look at a smaller set of metrics.

- The paper benchmarks multiple state-of-the-art models, including both academic and commercial systems. Comparisons across systems are insightful. Some prior work focuses on evaluating a single model or method.

- One limitation is the benchmark currently has 500 prompts, which is relatively small compared to some other benchmarks with thousands or more prompts. The diversity and difficulty of evaluation likely increases with more prompts.

Overall, the multi-aspect analysis, real-world prompting, and human alignment aspects differentiate this work from prior text-to-video evaluation research. The comprehensive set of metrics and model comparisons also add value. Expanding the scale and diversity of the benchmark will be important future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more comprehensive prompt lists/benchmarks for evaluating text-to-video models, with more diverse and complex prompts. The current benchmark of 500 prompts is still limited.

- Exploring better motion quality evaluation metrics using future advances in video understanding models and foundation models. Currently evaluating general motion quality is challenging.

- Expanding the pool of human annotators and collecting more diverse opinion scores to reduce bias/improve accuracy of human alignment. Currently only 3 annotators were used.

- Considering longer, multi-shot videos instead of just cinemagraphs/short clips. Current models still mainly generate short single scene videos.

- Evaluating more aspects like audio generation, video captioning, etc. The current work focuses only on visual quality, text alignment, motion quality and temporal consistency.

- Studying social biases, harmful content generation, factuality/accuracy of generated content. The current evaluation is only technical.

- Comparing more model architectures like recurrent, transformer, 3D CNN etc. Currently mainly diffusion models were tested.

- Expanding beyond English text prompts to multilingual evaluation.

- Evaluating wider range of video resolutions, frame rates, lengths etc.

- Open challenges in controllable video generation, interactive editing of generated videos.

In summary, the key future directions are developing more comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and techniques, evaluating more models, aspects and use cases, and studying societal impacts like biases, misinformation etc.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework and pipeline called EvalCrafter to comprehensively evaluate the performance of text-to-video generative models. The authors argue that existing metrics like FVD and IS are insufficient to judge these large conditional generative models trained on diverse datasets. To address this, they first construct a new prompt list for text-to-video generation by analyzing real-world prompts with the help of a large language model. The prompt list contains 500 prompts covering common objects, attributes and motions. Next, they evaluate several state-of-the-art video generative models on the prompts using around 18 objective metrics across four aspects - visual quality, content quality, motion quality, and text-caption alignment. To obtain a final leaderboard, they fit coefficients to align the objective metrics with user opinions collected through studies. Their final score shows higher correlation to user opinions than simply averaging metrics.

In summary, the key ideas are: (1) Existing metrics are insufficient to evaluate large text-to-video models trained on diverse data. (2) The authors construct a comprehensive prompt benchmark for evaluation. (3) They evaluate models on the benchmark using multiple objective metrics covering different aspects. (4) They align metrics to user opinions to produce an overall score that reliably ranks model performance. The proposed framework and human alignment method allows more robust evaluation of text-to-video models.
