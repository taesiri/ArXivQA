# [Semantic Properties of cosine based bias scores for word embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There exists a large number of bias measures and scores proposed in the literature to detect biases in word embeddings. However, there is little analysis and understanding of what these scores actually measure and how suitable they are for quantifying bias.

- In particular, the paper focuses on cosine-similarity based bias scores like WEAT and DirectBias. It argues these scores have some theoretical limitations regarding their ability to quantify bias in a consistent and comparable manner.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formally defines intuitive requirements for bias scores regarding their trustworthiness (ability to detect bias properly) and comparability (ability to compare bias quantities between models).

- It provides a formal analysis of WEAT and DirectBias with respect to these requirements, proving theoretical limitations. For WEAT it shows the effect size is not trustworthy and the individual bias score is not comparable. For DirectBias it shows it is not trustworthy.

- The paper complements the formal analysis with experiments, highlighting practical manifestations of these limitations on real language models.

Main Contributions:
- Formal requirements for properties of bias scores regarding bias quantification
- Formal analysis of WEAT and DirectBias w.r.t. these requirements, proving theoretical limitations
- Experiments underlining these limitations in practice
- Provides better understanding of capabilities and restrictions of prominent bias scores
- Lays groundwork for analyzing other bias scores and developing better quantification measures

Overall, the paper makes an important contribution towards better understanding bias scores and their abilities to quantify bias. It clearly highlights restrictions of popular methods, advises about their proper usage, and enables more informed application and development of bias measurement tools.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper theoretically analyzes semantic properties of cosine-based bias scores for word embeddings, specifically the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and Direct Bias, finding limitations in their ability to quantify bias comparably across models and fully detect individual sample biases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) Formalizing the properties of trustworthiness and comparability as requirements for cosine based bias scores. 

(ii) Analyzing two prominent cosine based bias scores from the literature (WEAT and Direct Bias) with regard to these requirements, showing that they have limitations in terms of bias quantification.

(iii) Conducting experiments on state-of-the-art language models to demonstrate that the theoretical limitations of WEAT and Direct Bias actually occur in practice. 

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical analysis framework to understand properties of cosine based bias scores, applies this analysis to prominent examples, and shows experimentally that the limitations matter in real applications. This helps researchers to better interpret these bias scores and take their restrictions into account when measuring or mitigating bias. The paper lays groundwork to evaluate other bias scores and develop improved methods for bias quantification.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes formal requirements of "trustworthiness" and "comparability" for bias scores. Can you explain in detail what these properties mean and why they are important for quantifying bias? 

2. Theorems 1 and 2 analyze the individual bias score s(t,A,B) of WEAT with respect to the proposed requirements. Summarize the findings and discuss their implications on using s(t,A,B) to quantify bias.  

3. The paper shows that the effect size d(X,Y,A,B) of WEAT meets the comparability requirement but not the trustworthiness property. Elaborate on the proof of Theorem 3 and explain why this is problematic when quantifying bias with the effect size.

4. Theorem 4 states that the Direct Bias meets comparability. Outline the proof and discuss whether this alone is sufficient to use the Direct Bias for bias quantification.

5. The proof of Theorem 5 constructs a counter example to show that the Direct Bias is not trustworthy. Explain this example in detail and analyze how it demonstrates flaws in the PCA approach used by the Direct Bias. 

6. In Section 5.1, experiments highlight limitations of the effect size for bias quantification. Summarize the experiments and analyses why the effect size can be misleading to compare bias severeness. 

7. Section 5.2 shows that the attribute difference ||â-b̂|| impacts the range of possible values for s(t,A,B). Explain why this is problematic when comparing individual biases between embedding models.

8. The experiment in Section 5.3 indicates that the PCA approach can select poor bias directions when constructing the Direct Bias. Discuss this experiment and how the selection of inappropriate bias directions can impact the Direct Bias.

9. The paper focuses its analysis on WEAT and the Direct Bias. Discuss how the proposed requirements could be used to analyze other cosine similarity based bias scores from the literature.

10. The conclusions state that the limitations of cosine based scores may be due to flaws in specific bias scores rather than a general unsuitability of geometric bias measures. Elaborate on this statement and explain why comparative analyses of bias scores are important.
