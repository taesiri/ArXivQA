# [Tem-adapter: Adapting Image-Text Pretraining for Video Question Answer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08414)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is how to efficiently transfer knowledge from large pre-trained image-text models to video question answering tasks. The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Learning temporal dynamics is important for adapting image models to video QA. Current methods that directly fine-tune or adapt image models using only the downstream QA objective cannot learn these dynamics well. 2) Interactions between the visual and textual domains can help reduce the semantic gap between image pre-training and video QA tasks. Current methods do not exploit these interactions.3) An auxiliary language-guided autoregressive task can facilitate learning of temporal dependencies in the visual features. Optimizing this along with the QA objective enables predicting future states based on historical context. 4) Creating declarative sentences from QA pairs and refining text using video context helps adapt the textual representation and reduces semantic gaps.The central research question seems to be how to efficiently adapt image-text models to video QA using techniques like auxiliary tasks and cross-modal interaction to learn temporal and semantic relationships. The paper proposes a framework called Tem-Adapter that implements the above hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing Tem-Adapter, an approach to adapt image-text pretraining models like CLIP to video question answering tasks. Tem-Adapter has two components:- A visual Temporal Aligner that uses a Transformer encoder-decoder to learn temporal dynamics and refine visual features. This is guided by an auxiliary autoregressive prediction task. - A textual Semantic Aligner that designs templates to convert QA pairs to declarative sentences and uses a Transformer decoder to refine text features using the full video as context.2. Conducting experiments on two video QA datasets - SUTD-TrafficQA and MSR-VTT-MC. Tem-Adapter shows significant improvement over various baselines that transfer CLIP in different ways like finetuning, adapters, and prompt learning.3. Providing analysis showing the importance of learning temporal dynamics and leveraging cross-modal interaction between vision and language for adapting CLIP. The visualizations also highlight some limitations in complex reasoning.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Tem-Adapter to adapt image-text models like CLIP to video QA by using cross-modal interaction and auxiliary tasks to learn temporal dynamics and reduce semantic gaps. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Tem-Adapter that adapts image-text pre-trained models like CLIP to the video question answering task by using cross-modal interactions to learn temporal dynamics and complex event semantics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper presents a novel adapter-based approach to adapting image-text pre-trained models like CLIP to video question answering. Most prior work has focused on pre-training large video-text models from scratch rather than adapting existing image-text models. The adapter approach is more efficient and allows leveraging powerful existing image-text models.- The proposed Tem-Adapter introduces an autoregressive task and cross-modal interaction to learn temporal dynamics and align semantics between image and video domains. This differs from other adapter methods like CLIP-Adapter that just add simple linear adapter layers without any auxiliary tasks or cross-modal alignment. - Compared to other video QA methods, Tem-Adapter seems to achieve state-of-the-art results on TrafficQA and competitive results on MSRVTT-MC. The gains over methods like finetuning CLIP or CLIP-Adapter highlight the benefits of the proposed adapters and alignment tasks.- The ablation studies provide useful analysis on the contribution of the different components of Tem-Adapter. Removing the temporal or semantic aligners significantly hurts performance, demonstrating their importance.- The visualization provides some intuition on how Tem-Adapter is able to capture temporal dynamics and semantics better than just using CLIP features directly.Overall, the adapter-based approach seems novel compared to prior video QA research, and the autoregressive and cross-modal alignment tasks appear to provide meaningful improvements. The strong empirical results validate the efficacy of the proposed method. More analysis on how the adapted representations differ from original CLIP would be interesting future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more sophisticated language templates to better convert question-answer pairs into natural declarative sentences. The authors note limitations of their current template-based approach for complex questions involving reasoning. They suggest exploring more advanced natural language generation techniques.- Enhancing the reasoning and causal inference capabilities of the model. The authors acknowledge their approach focuses on associating events in the visual and textual domains rather than uncovering causal structures and reasoning. They suggest incorporating more inductive biases and methodologies from causal reasoning literature.- Exploring different adapter architectures and objectives for aligning the visual and textual domains. The authors propose temporal and semantic alignment with a specific adapter design, but other adapter models could be studied.- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of video QA datasets and tasks. The authors demonstrate results on two datasets, but further benchmarking on other datasets could better analyze the robustness and limitations.- Extending the approach to online feature extraction and end-to-end training within the visual backbone. Currently visual features are extracted offline - online extraction could improve efficiency.- Investigating ways to reduce the computational overhead during inference. The authors note generating features for all candidate answers is time-consuming. Approaches to approximate or limit this could be useful.- Applying the adapters to other vision-language models besides CLIP. The authors use a fixed CLIP model, but adapting other models could be explored.- Studying social impacts and potential misuse cases of video QA systems. The authors briefly mention the need to consider broader impacts, which is an important direction.In summary, the main suggestions involve developing more sophisticated language and reasoning capabilities, broadening the approach to other models/datasets, reducing computational costs, and studying social impacts. The adapter architecture seems promising but can continue to be improved and extended.
