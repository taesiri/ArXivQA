# [Tem-adapter: Adapting Image-Text Pretraining for Video Question Answer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08414)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is how to efficiently transfer knowledge from large pre-trained image-text models to video question answering tasks. The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Learning temporal dynamics is important for adapting image models to video QA. Current methods that directly fine-tune or adapt image models using only the downstream QA objective cannot learn these dynamics well. 2) Interactions between the visual and textual domains can help reduce the semantic gap between image pre-training and video QA tasks. Current methods do not exploit these interactions.3) An auxiliary language-guided autoregressive task can facilitate learning of temporal dependencies in the visual features. Optimizing this along with the QA objective enables predicting future states based on historical context. 4) Creating declarative sentences from QA pairs and refining text using video context helps adapt the textual representation and reduces semantic gaps.The central research question seems to be how to efficiently adapt image-text models to video QA using techniques like auxiliary tasks and cross-modal interaction to learn temporal and semantic relationships. The paper proposes a framework called Tem-Adapter that implements the above hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing Tem-Adapter, an approach to adapt image-text pretraining models like CLIP to video question answering tasks. Tem-Adapter has two components:- A visual Temporal Aligner that uses a Transformer encoder-decoder to learn temporal dynamics and refine visual features. This is guided by an auxiliary autoregressive prediction task. - A textual Semantic Aligner that designs templates to convert QA pairs to declarative sentences and uses a Transformer decoder to refine text features using the full video as context.2. Conducting experiments on two video QA datasets - SUTD-TrafficQA and MSR-VTT-MC. Tem-Adapter shows significant improvement over various baselines that transfer CLIP in different ways like finetuning, adapters, and prompt learning.3. Providing analysis showing the importance of learning temporal dynamics and leveraging cross-modal interaction between vision and language for adapting CLIP. The visualizations also highlight some limitations in complex reasoning.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Tem-Adapter to adapt image-text models like CLIP to video QA by using cross-modal interaction and auxiliary tasks to learn temporal dynamics and reduce semantic gaps. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
