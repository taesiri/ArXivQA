# [mc-BEiT: Multi-choice Discretization for Image BERT Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15371)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we improve image BERT pre-training by easing the strict mapping between masked patch predictions and unique token ids used in prior work like BEiT? 

The key hypothesis is that using multi-choice vision token ids, rather than unique hard labels, for the masked patches will lead to better pre-training performance. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:

1) There is no single "correct" way to discretize visual patches, so assigning them unique labels is suboptimal. 

2) Semantically similar image patches should have shared/overlapping predictions, rather than being forced to map to distinct token ids.

3) By using soft probability vectors over possible token ids and incorporating inter-patch similarity, they can create better multi-choice training objectives for masked patches.

The proposed mc-BEiT method explores this hypothesis by introducing eased multi-choice vision token predictions for masked patches based on both the tokenizer outputs and inter-patch feature similarities. The experiments aim to validate whether this approach improves pre-training and downstream task performance compared to prior single-choice classification used in BEiT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an improved BERT-style image pre-training method called mc-BEiT, which uses multi-choice discretization objectives instead of mapping masked patches to unique token IDs. 

2. It introduces a multi-choice supervised signal formed by soft probability vectors predicted by an off-the-shelf image tokenizer. These are further refined using inter-patch semantic similarities estimated from the vision transformer features.

3. The multi-choice objectives provide more diverse and semantically meaningful target signals compared to BEiT's hard classification targets. This improves the model's ability to capture visual semantics.

4. Extensive experiments show mc-BEiT outperforms BEiT and other self-supervised methods on image classification, detection, segmentation across ImageNet, COCO and ADE20K datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a more effective multi-choice objective for masked image modeling, which improves visual semantics and outperforms prior arts in various vision tasks. The core ideas are using soft probability vectors and inter-patch similarities to create better supervision for the masked patches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an improved BERT-style image pre-training method called mc-BEiT, which uses multi-choice discretization objectives with soft probability vectors to allow semantically similar image patches to share predictions instead of assigning them unique hard token ids.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on image BERT pre-training:

- This paper introduces a new method called mc-BEiT that improves upon the BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) approach for image pre-training. BEiT was one of the first to apply BERT-style masked image modeling to vision transformers. 

- Where BEiT uses a unique hard label from an off-the-shelf tokenizer as the target for masked patch prediction, mc-BEiT proposes using multi-choice soft probability vectors instead. This is intended to provide more diverse and semantically meaningful targets.

- To generate the multi-choice targets, mc-BEiT leverages both the raw predictions from the tokenizer as well as refined probabilities based on semantic similarity between patches encoded by the model. This aims to inject semantic relational knowledge.

- Compared to other recent MIM methods like MAE, iBOT, and SimMIM, mc-BEiT takes a different approach by modifying the targets rather than the masking or reconstruction process itself. It is also tokenizer-agnostic.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over BEiT and other recent methods on ImageNet classification. Transfer learning results on COCO and ADE20K are also strong, showing the benefits of mc-BEiT's pre-training approach.

- The modifications presented require no additional training stages or overhead compared to BEiT. The overall approach is flexible and effective in improving BERT-style pre-training for vision transformers.

In summary, mc-BEiT makes important contributions to this field by introducing multi-choice objectives to better capture semantics during pre-training. The results validate its advantages over existing MIM techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the image tokenizer with perceptual and semantic regularizations. The authors note that while BEiT provides a feasible solution for image discretization, using an off-the-shelf tokenizer has limitations. Developing better tokenizers that capture perceptual and semantic similarity could further improve masked image modeling.

- Exploring different masking strategies. The authors experiment with block vs random masking at different masking ratios. Systematically studying the impact of different masking approaches could provide insights into how to create better pre-training objectives.

- Applying multi-choice objectives to other self-supervised learning methods. The multi-choice targets seem promising for masked prediction tasks. It would be interesting to investigate if similar ideas could benefit other pretext tasks like contrastive learning. 

- Pre-training larger models on more data. The authors use ViT-B and ViT-L models pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. Scaling up the model size and pre-training data could lead to further improvements.

- Evaluating on more downstream tasks. The authors demonstrate strong performance on classification, detection and segmentation. Testing on other tasks like video, multi-modal data, etc could better measure the generalizability.

- Understanding theoretical underpinnings. While the empirical results are positive, analyzing the method through a theoretical lens could provide better understanding of why the multi-choice objectives work well.

In summary, the authors propose multi-choice targets as a promising research direction, and suggest several ways to build on this idea to advance masked image modeling and self-supervised visual pre-training.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes mc-BEiT, an improved BERT-style image pre-training method for masked image modeling (MIM). It argues that modeling MIM as a strict hard-label classification task with unique token ids for masked patches, as done in prior work like BEiT, is sub-optimal. Instead, it proposes using soft probability vectors over all possible token ids as multi-choice supervision targets for the masked patches. These multi-choice targets are obtained by taking the output distribution from an off-the-shelf discrete VAE image tokenizer and refining it based on semantic similarity between image patches encoded by the model being trained. This allows semantically similar patches to share their predictions. Experiments on image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks show mc-BEiT outperforms previous supervised and self-supervised pre-training methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results. For example, a ViT-Base model pre-trained with mc-BEiT achieves 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved BERT-style image pre-training method called mc-BEiT, which performs masked image modeling (MIM) using multi-choice discretization targets instead of unique hard labels. Recent approaches like BEiT perform MIM by predicting a unique discrete token for each masked patch using an off-the-shelf tokenizer. However, the authors argue that there is no single ground-truth answer for visual discretization. Instead, they propose producing soft probability vectors over all possible discrete tokens for each patch, refined using similarity between patch embeddings, to provide multiple choices for the MIM prediction target. 

The method first generates softened probability vectors for each patch using the tokenizer, then propagates probabilities between similar patches based on cosine similarity of patch embeddings from the model being trained. The final MIM target is a weighted combination of the direct and propagated probabilities. Experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO detection/segmentation, and ADE20K segmentation show state-of-the-art results. For example, a ViT-B model achieves 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification. Ablations validate design choices like the temperature and equilibrium coefficients. Visualizations also demonstrate that the approach allows semantically similar patches to share predictions.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an improved BERT-style image pre-training method called mc-BEiT, which performs masked image modeling (MIM) using multi-choice discretization rather than assigning unique labels to masked patches. Specifically, it uses the soft probability vectors predicted by an off-the-shelf image tokenizer as multi-choice supervision targets for masked patches. These soft targets are further refined by propagating the probabilities among semantically similar patches based on their feature similarities encoded by the vision transformer being trained. This allows semantically similar patches to share their probability predictions. The final training objective is a soft cross-entropy loss between the model's predictions for masked patches and these refined multi-choice targets. Compared to BEiT's hard classification loss with unique labels, this multi-choice loss enables more diverse and semantically meaningful predictions. Extensive experiments show mc-BEiT outperforms BEiT and other methods on image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper introduces mc-BEiT, an improved BERT-style image pre-training method with eased and refined multi-choice discretization objectives for masked image modeling (MIM). 

The key problems and questions addressed in this paper are:

1) Does the masked patch prediction in MIM have ground-truth answers? Unlike linguistic vocabulary which has discrete words, there is no perfect answer for visual discretization, so assigning unique token ids to masked patches may not be optimal. 

2) Should the masked patch be assigned a unique token id given a pre-learned tokenizer? The paper argues that it should not be, as semantically similar patches may be allocated different ids while dissimilar patches allocated the same id by the tokenizer.

3) Can image patches share token ids if the patch doesn't have a unique id? The paper proposes patches with similar high-level visual perceptions should share their predictions.

To address these issues, the paper introduces multi-choice objectives for MIM using soft probability vectors instead of hard unique labels. It also refines the objectives by propagating probabilities between semantically similar patches based on feature similarities. This allows similar patches to share predictions and incorporates inter-patch relations into the pre-training.

Overall, the key contribution is improving MIM for image BERT pre-training by moving from single-choice hard labels to eased and refined multi-choice objectives formed by soft probabilities and inter-patch similarities.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved BERT-style image pre-training method called mc-BEiT, which performs masked image modeling (MIM) using multi-choice training objectives. Unlike BEiT which assigns a unique token ID to each masked patch, mc-BEiT uses softened probability distributions over all token IDs as training targets. This allows semantically similar patches to share possible token choices during training. To generate these multi-choice targets, the method combines the soft token probability vectors predicted by an off-the-shelf image tokenizer with an additional refinement based on estimated inter-patch perceptual similarities from the in-training Transformer model. This ensembles the choices from low-level pixel similarities and high-level semantic relations. Experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO detection/segmentation, and ADE20K segmentation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods like iBOT and MAE. Key advantages are better convergence and transferability with fewer pre-training epochs. The improved multi-choice objective is shown to better model inter-patch semantic similarities compared to BEiT's one-hot classification targets.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called mc-BEiT for improving image BERT pre-training with vision transformers. The key idea is to formulate masked image modeling (MIM) as a multi-choice classification problem rather than forcing each patch to be predicted as a single token id. Specifically, they adopt soft probability vectors over the discrete token ids as training targets, which are obtained from an off-the-shelf image tokenizer and further refined by propagating probabilities between semantically similar patches. This provides multiple possible token choices for each masked patch instead of one hard label.

The method achieves state-of-the-art performance by enabling more flexible masked patch prediction objectives.
