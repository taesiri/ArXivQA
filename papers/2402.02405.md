# [Angle Robustness Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation in GNSS-Denied   Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- UAVs rely on GPS for navigation, but often lose signal due to environmental conditions. Vision-based navigation has emerged as an alternative, but existing techniques have limitations:
	- Classification-based methods are prone to cumulative flight errors due to inaccurate position predictions. 
	- Matching-based methods require large storage and are time-consuming.
	- Both struggle with flight deviations caused by disturbances.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel "angle robustness navigation paradigm" is proposed to address flight deviation. 
- An angle robustness navigation model is designed to directly predict the direction angle rather than position.
- Key modules of the model:
	- Adaptive Feature Enhance Module: Extracts visual features from previous frames.  
	- Cross-Knowledge Attention Module: Integrates path semantic information into the features.
	- Robust Task-Oriented Head Module: Predicts angles robustly using a Robust Activation Module.
	- Auxiliary heads for current/next position prediction.
	
- A new dataset "UAV_AR368" with 368 routes and over 56k images is collected.
- A Simulation Flight Testing Instrument (SFTI) using Google Earth is designed to simulate various flight environments for efficient testing.

Main Contributions:
- First angle robustness navigation paradigm and model for UAVs to address flight deviation. Departs from traditional two-stage position-then-angle approaches.
- Novel model architecture with Adaptive Feature Enhance Module, Cross-Knowledge Attention Module and Robust Task-Oriented Head Module.
- New UAV navigation dataset with over 56k images across 368 routes. 
- Simulation Flight Testing Instrument for efficient, low-cost testing of vision-based UAV navigation methods.
- Experiments show proposed method improves success rate by 26.0% and 45.6% in ideal/disturbed settings over state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel angle robustness navigation paradigm and model to directly predict the flight direction angle for addressing UAV deviations caused by disturbances in realistic point-to-point navigation scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel angle robustness navigation paradigm and model to effectively address flight deviation caused by disturbances in realistic environments for UAV point-to-point navigation. Specifically:

1) It proposes the first angle robustness navigation paradigm that departs from traditional two-stage navigation methods and directly predicts the direction angle in an end-to-end manner to address flight deviation efficiently.

2) An angle robustness navigation model is designed incorporating several key components including the Adaptive Feature Enhance Module, Cross-knowledge Attention-guided Module, and Robust Task-oriented Head Module to predict robust and accurate direction angles. 

3) A new dataset named UAV_AR368 and a flight testing tool called Simulation Flight Testing Instrument (SFTI) are introduced to enable efficient evaluation of vision-based navigation methods in realistic settings.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm and model achieve significant improvements in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods in both ideal and disturbed testing environments.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and more robust angle-based navigation approach and evaluation tools to address the flight deviation issue in UAV point-to-point navigation.
