## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality 3D facial animations has applications in movies and games, but requires complex multi-view studio setups and manual efforts to create personalized facial rigs. 
- Using RGB videos from mobile devices for facial modeling is more accessible, but reconstruction quality is limited due to ambiguity and compatibility with animation pipelines is lacking.

Proposed Solution:
- Reconstruct personalized blendshape rigs from single or sparse multi-view RGB videos using neural inverse rendering. Blendshapes enable compatibility with animation pipelines.
- Jointly optimize blendshapes and expression coefficients to fit videos. Use novel blendshape deformation technique to allow high-quality deformations.
- Enforce semantic regularization on expression bases during optimization to maintain interpretability. 
- Implicitly synchronize unsynchronized multi-view videos using neural regressor.

Key Contributions:
- Animation-ready facial rigging from RGB videos to bridge gap between neural inverse rendering and traditional pipelines.
- Blendshape deformation method using differential coordinates and tetrahedral connections for smooth and interpenetration-free deformations.
- Joint optimization with regularization to update expression bases and their coefficients simultaneously.
- Neural synchronization regressor to enable easy-to-setup multi-view capture.

The method achieves state-of-the-art geometric accuracy. The reconstructed rigs can generate high-quality animations and novel views, and are compatible with animation software like Blender. Limitations include lack of hair and tongue modeling.
