# [Right for Right Reasons: Large Language Models for Verifiable   Commonsense Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) store factual knowledge but cannot answer queries that require commonsense reasoning, e.g. "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?".  
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising reasoning abilities but suffer from hallucination, introducing ungrounded or incorrect information. This issue is worse for queries about obscure/recent entities.
- Existing LLM-based KGQA methods cannot answer commonsense queries in a verifiable manner. Their reasoning processes are not grounded on KG facts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Right for Right Reasons (R3), a novel KGQA methodology that enables answering commonsense queries involving both KG facts and commonsense reasoning in a verifiable manner.
- Key ideas:
   - Surface commonsense knowledge required for reasoning as explicit axioms rather than keeping it implicit
   - Enforce factual reasoning steps to be grounded on retrieved KG triples
   - Iterate retrieval of more relevant KG facts if existing facts are insufficient
   - Overall reasoning takes the form of a tree-structured search grounded on KG

Main Contributions:
- R3 allows answering commonsense KG queries in a verifiable manner, with explicit commonsense axioms and KG-grounded factual steps.
- Experiments on question answering, claim verification and preference matching tasks show R3 reduces hallucination and improves accuracy over baselines.
- Notably, R3 maintains high performance on queries about obscure/recent entities while baselines struggle.
- R3 also shows stronger commonsense reasoning abilities.
- The methodology opens up possibilities for reliably applying LLM reasoners to real-world KG-based applications.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed R3 solution and its ability to perform verifiable commonsense KGQA, as well as experimental results highlighting reductions in hallucination and improved reasoning over baselines. It also notes the real-world applicability offered by R3's reliability and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes R^3, a verifiable commonsense knowledge graph question answering methodology that surfaces the intrinsic commonsense knowledge of large language models as axioms to guide grounded factual reasoning over knowledge graph triples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing $R^3$, a novel framework for answering knowledge graph queries involving commonsense reasoning using large language models (LLMs) in a verifiable manner. Specifically:

- $R^3$ allows for verifiable reasoning by axiomatically surfacing the intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs to explicitly guide the reasoning process, rather than relying on the LLMs' implicit reasoning. 

- It grounds every factual reasoning step on specific knowledge graph triples, enabling the verification of factual claims.

- It formulates the query answering process as a tree-search, retrieving additional relevant facts when needed to avoid ungrounded guesses.

- Experiments across question answering, claim verification and preference matching tasks demonstrate $R^3$'s superior performance over existing methods. Notably, it achieves higher accuracy while reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.

- $R^3$ also exhibits robustness to shifts in entity popularity, maintaining high performance on queries about obscure, long-tail entities.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling verifiable commonsense reasoning for knowledge graph QA through an explicit reasoning process grounded on retrieved facts. The experiments validate $R^3$ as an improved approach over current state-of-the-art methods.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper are:

- Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) 
- Commonsense reasoning
- Hallucination
- Verifiability
- Right for Right Reasons ($R^3$)
- Axiomatically surfacing commonsense knowledge
- Fact-grounded answer selection
- Missing evidence identification
- Comparisons to existing KGQA methods like KAPING, KB-BINDER, KGR
- Evaluations on question answering, claim verification, preference matching tasks
- Robustness to shifts in entity popularity/long-tail entities

The paper proposes a new KGQA methodology called $R^3$ that allows for verifiable commonsense reasoning using LLMs. It surfaces the intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs as axioms and grounds the factual reasoning steps on KG triples. Experiments show $R^3$ reduces hallucination and improves accuracy over baselines, especially for queries involving long-tail entities. The key ideas focus on making the LLM reasoning process explicit and grounding it on factual knowledge to enable verification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the proposed method in the paper:

1. The paper proposes surfacing commonsense axioms from the LLM to make the reasoning process explicit and verifiable. How exactly does the model extract these axioms? Does it require additional supervision or prompts? 

2. The paper mentions using both an entity linker and an LLM-based module to extract entities from the question. What is the motivation behind this dual approach? Does using the LLM module significantly improve entity extraction over just using an entity linker?

3. The paper describes obtaining relevant subgraphs and pruning triples using dense retrieval and an LLM module. What is the intuition behind using two different mechanisms for subgraph extraction and pruning? How do you ensure no vital information is lost during pruning?

4. When the available facts are insufficient to ground the commonsense axiom, how does the model decide what additional evidence is missing? Does it generate natural language describing the missing information or take some other approach? 

5. What structured representation does the model use for the commonsense axioms? Are they parsed into some logical form or kept as natural language statements? What are the tradeoffs?

6. Does the model place any restrictions on the complexity or structure of the commonsense axioms? For example, are they limited to rules with conjunctive antecedents or particular types of consequents? 

7. The model description is quite abstract. Can you provide more implementation details like model architecture, parameter sizes, optimization details, etc? What were some implementation challenges you faced?

8. The paper evaluates on multiple datasets which require some modification to introduce commonsense reasoning and personalization. Can you describe the dataset creation process in more detail? What guidelines did you provide to crowdworkers?

9. Error analysis revealed some limitations around axiom quality affecting reasoning quality. What are some ideas you have to improve the quality and coverage of extracted commonsense axioms?

10. The methodology seems quite general. What are some other potential applications you see for this approach to verifiable commonsense reasoning with LLMs? What are limitations to the approach that still need to be addressed?
