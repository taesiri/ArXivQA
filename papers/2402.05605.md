# [Optimizing Delegation in Collaborative Human-AI Hybrid Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of managing hybrid teams composed of humans and AI agents collaborating to accomplish a goal. In particular, it focuses on the scenario where at any point in time, only a single agent is authorized to take actions on behalf of the team. The key challenges are 1) determining which agent should be granted control authority at a given time to optimize team performance, and 2) minimizing the number of times control needs to be transferred between agents to reduce complexity. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an AI manager based on reinforcement learning (RL) that oversees the team and determines which agent should have control. The manager learns by observing the states of the environment and the outcomes of the agents' actions, receiving occasional feedback signals when constraints representing acceptable behavior are violated. The manager aims to maximize a reward function that trades off team performance vs. frequency of control transfers. Crucially, the manager does not have direct access to the agents' internal states, rewards or policies. This allows it to oversee teams of independently trained agents with no modifications.

Key Contributions:
- A general framework and formal model for an RL-based manager overseeing single-agent control delegation in hybrid human-AI teams
- Proofs that the manager's learning process converges optimally 
- Demonstration of the framework in a simulated driving scenario with human and AI drivers of varying skill levels. Experiments show the manager successfully identifies the best driver for different road conditions and driving tasks, improving success rate by up to 187% over the top individual driver.

In summary, the key innovation is an RL-based manager that can oversee heterogeneous pre-trained agents and determine optimal points for transferring control authority, thereby improving overall team performance. The framework is general and could be applied to other hybrid team scenarios besides driving.
