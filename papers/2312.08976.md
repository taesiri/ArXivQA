# [Entity-Augmented Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08976)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores a new task of code generation utilizing external entities from knowledge bases. The authors collect and publish a novel dataset for project-level code generation, where the model must reuse functions defined elsewhere in the project code. They demonstrate that existing retrieval-augmented language models struggle with this task, partly due to inability to distinguish between similar entity names. To address this, they propose a novel model architecture that injects a scalable entity retriever directly into the decoder of a pretrained language model. This allows the model to select entire entities as tokens when generating code, rather than trying to generate entity names token-by-token. The authors evaluate their model on the project code dataset, as well as existing SQL and Bash command generation datasets. Their method consistently outperforms baselines across tasks, especially when the number of entities per sample grows. They demonstrate the importance of jointly training the retriever and generator, as well as using cross-attention between them. While promising, the approach performs less effectively on Bash command generation where entity order does not matter. Overall, this work introduces a scalable technique for entity-based code generation that could enable solving practical programming problems.
