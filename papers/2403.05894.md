# [Frequency Attention for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Frequency Attention for Knowledge Distillation":

Problem:
- Knowledge distillation is used to train a compact student neural network to mimic a larger teacher network, but most attention-based distillation methods focus on spatial attention maps that affect local regions. 
- Spatial attention may not capture global context or higher-level patterns needed for effective knowledge transfer from teacher to student.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Frequency Attention Module (FAM) that operates in the Fourier frequency domain to encourage the student to capture both detailed and global information from the teacher.
- FAM has a learnable global filter that adjusts the frequencies of the student's features to mimic patterns in the teacher's features. This acts as attention in the frequency domain.
- Also propose enhanced student architectures by integrating FAM into layer-to-layer and knowledge review distillation mechanisms.

Main Contributions:
- Novel frequency attention module with learnable global filter that adjusts frequencies of student's features to mimic teacher.
- FAM encourages student to capture both detailed local and global structure information from teacher.
- Proposed enhanced layer-to-layer and knowledge review distillation architectures using FAM.
- Extensive experiments showing proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100, ImageNet for classification and COCO for detection.

In summary, the key idea is to use a frequency attention module to mimic global patterns in addition to local details from a teacher network. This is integrated into distillation architectures and shown to improve student performance across multiple tasks.
