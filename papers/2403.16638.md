# [AI-Generated Video Detection via Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Advancements in AI generation models have enabled highly realistic fake videos that can spread misinformation. However, there is a lack of effective blind detection methods to differentiate real vs AI-generated videos.

- Prior works on detecting fake images or fake face videos do not generalize well to AI-generated videos with diverse scenes. 

- The problem of reliably detecting AI-generated videos with high generalization ability is pointed out and addressed.

Proposed Solution - AIGVDet:  
- A two-branch convolutional neural network is proposed to capture spatial and temporal anomalies in RGB frames and optical flow maps between frames. 

- Two ResNet50 encoders are trained separately to identify anomalies and extract discriminative features from the spatial and optical flow domains.

- A decision level fusion classifier integrates the predicted probabilities from both domains to enhance discrimination ability.

Main Contributions:

- Identify that AI-generated videos, despite visually realistic frames, often have discontinuities and abnormalities in optical flow maps.

- Construct a large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) covering 11 state-of-the-art generation models for evaluation.

- Achieve over 91% accuracy in detecting videos from unseen models, significantly outperforming prior arts. Demonstrate robustness against compression.

- Establish an effective generated video detection baseline with high generalization ability across model types, resolutions and modalities.

In summary, this paper pioneers the problem of AI-generated video detection, proposes an effective solution capitalizing on spatial-temporal inconsistencies, and provides extensive benchmarking of generalization ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an AI-generated video detection scheme called AIGVDet that captures spatial and temporal anomalies in videos using a two-branch convolutional neural network model for discrimination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by capturing forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional neural network. Specifically:

1) It proposes a two-branch detector architecture that learns to identify anomalies in spatial and optical flow domains separately using ResNet sub-detectors. The results of such sub-detectors are then fused to further enhance discrimination ability. 

2) It constructs a large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) as a benchmark for model training and evaluation. The dataset contains over 11k videos yielded by 11 state-of-the-art generator models.

3) It conducts extensive experiments that verify the high generalization and robustness of the proposed AIGVDet scheme in detecting various types of AI-generated videos, even under compression.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective and robust AI-generated video detection scheme, along with a dataset and comprehensive experiments to validate its capabilities. The work serves as an strong baseline for detecting generated video content.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-branch model consisting of a spatial domain detector and an optical flow detector. Why is such a two-branch model used instead of a single branch model? What are the advantages of capturing spatial and temporal anomalies separately?

2. The optical flow detector focuses on capturing temporal inconsistencies in generated videos. Why do generated videos tend to have more temporal inconsistencies compared to real videos? What are some examples of such inconsistencies manifesting in optical flow maps? 

3. Different fusion methods like feature concatenation and addition are explored in the ablation study. Why does the decision fusion method work the best? What are the limitations of early and late fusion strategies?

4. The paper constructs a new generated video dataset (GVD) comprising videos from 11 different generator models. What is the rationale behind collecting videos from diverse generator models? How does this dataset construction methodology ensure a rigorous assessment of generalization capability?

5. What impacts does video compression have on the proposed detection scheme? Why does the performance degrade slightly under compression? What aspects of the compressed videos make the detection more challenging?  

6. The results show that the proposed method generalizes better to unseen generated video models compared to prior image forensic methods like Wang et al. What are the key differences in artifacts and inconsistencies between generated images and videos that lead to this difference in generalization capability?

7. The detection accuracy is higher for text-to-video models compared to image-to-video models. What intrinsic differences between these two paradigms explain this performance gap? How can the method be improved for image-to-video generation?

8. The paper only explores deepfake video detection. How suitable would this optical flow based technique be for detecting other types of video forgeries like splicing? What modifications would be needed to adapt the method for those use cases?

9. The method relies on using RAFT for optical flow estimation. How would the overall detection performance change if other optical flow algorithms were used instead? What qualities of optical flow maps are most discriminative for identifying generated videos?  

10. The paper demonstrates a proof-of-concept generated video detection method. What steps would be needed to transform this into a complete real-world detection system deployed for applications like social media platforms? What additional evaluation metrics and datasets would be required?
