# [AI-Generated Video Detection via Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Advancements in AI generation models have enabled highly realistic fake videos that can spread misinformation. However, there is a lack of effective blind detection methods to differentiate real vs AI-generated videos.

- Prior works on detecting fake images or fake face videos do not generalize well to AI-generated videos with diverse scenes. 

- The problem of reliably detecting AI-generated videos with high generalization ability is pointed out and addressed.

Proposed Solution - AIGVDet:  
- A two-branch convolutional neural network is proposed to capture spatial and temporal anomalies in RGB frames and optical flow maps between frames. 

- Two ResNet50 encoders are trained separately to identify anomalies and extract discriminative features from the spatial and optical flow domains.

- A decision level fusion classifier integrates the predicted probabilities from both domains to enhance discrimination ability.

Main Contributions:

- Identify that AI-generated videos, despite visually realistic frames, often have discontinuities and abnormalities in optical flow maps.

- Construct a large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) covering 11 state-of-the-art generation models for evaluation.

- Achieve over 91% accuracy in detecting videos from unseen models, significantly outperforming prior arts. Demonstrate robustness against compression.

- Establish an effective generated video detection baseline with high generalization ability across model types, resolutions and modalities.

In summary, this paper pioneers the problem of AI-generated video detection, proposes an effective solution capitalizing on spatial-temporal inconsistencies, and provides extensive benchmarking of generalization ability.
