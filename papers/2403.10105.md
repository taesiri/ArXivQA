# [Belief Aided Navigation using Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for   Avoiding Humans in Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent research in mobile robot navigation has focused on socially aware navigation in crowded environments. However, existing methods have difficulties properly accounting for human-robot interactions and require accurate omnidirectional sensor information, making them impractical for real-world use.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a new algorithm called BNBRL+ based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to assess risks in unobservable areas and formulate movement strategies under uncertainty.

- BNBRL+ combines belief algorithms with Bayesian neural networks to probabilistically infer beliefs about human positions based on observed data. It incorporates the dynamics between the robot, humans, and inferred beliefs to determine navigation paths.

- Social norms are embedded in the reward function to enable socially aware navigation.

Main Contributions:

- Integrates trajectory prediction and belief algorithms within a POMDP framework relying solely on observed human location data, making it more pragmatic and resilient.

- Introduces a novel network called BNBRL+ that combines prior architectures with Bayesian neural networks and an attention module. This allows a robot with limited field-of-view to understand interactions between itself, humans, and beliefs via a spatio-temporal interaction graph.

- Incorporates social norms into the reward structure to facilitate socially aware navigation.

- Demonstrates superior performance in risk-laden scenarios with limited visibility and obstacles compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ability to effectively navigate blind spots and avoid obstacles dynamically can significantly improve autonomous vehicle safety.

In summary, the key innovation is in using beliefs and Bayesian learning to handle uncertainty for robot navigation in crowded spaces, validated through extensive experiments. The reliability improvements enable practical real-world deployment.
