## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have generated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using adjoint sensitivity analysis to derive learning rules for event-based gated recurrent units (Section 3.3.1). Can you elaborate more on the continuous-time dynamical system view of the GRU and how the adjoint method allows computing gradients with sparse event-based communication?

2. EventProp (Section 3.3.2) computes exact gradients for spiking neural networks. How does the algorithm deal with the discontinuities introduced by spiking neuron models? And how does the multicast routing scheme distribute error signals during the backward pass?

3. For the e-prop learning rule (Section 3.3.3), what is the biological inspiration behind using an eligibility trace? How does e-prop reduce memory requirements compared to backpropagation through time?

4. The paper discusses mapping artificial neural networks (Section 2.1) and spiking neural networks (Section 2.2) to SpiNNaker 2. What are the main differences in mapping strategies between these two types of networks?

5. Deep rewiring (Section 2.1.2) maintains network sparsity during training. What techniques are used to decide which synapses to disconnect and where to rewire? How frequently is rewiring done?

6. The scheduling approach for mapping ANNs (Section 2.1.1) uses a central scheduler. What are the potential drawbacks of this approach as systems scale up? Are decentralized scheduling approaches being explored?  

7. For spiking neural networks mapped to SpiNNaker 2 (Section 2.2), what are the key steps involved in the transformation from trained SNN models to executable applications? What file formats are used to represent the network connectivity?

8. What custom hardware features does the SpiNNaker 2 chip provide to accelerate operations commonly used in spiking neural networks? How much speedup is achieved compared to software simulation?

9. The paper emphasizes event-based communication between processing elements. What techniques are used in the SpiNNaker 2 architecture and software stack to facilitate such event-based information exchange? 

10. For future work, what types of learning systems and algorithms are best suited to leverage the massively parallel and event-based capabilities provided by the SpiNNaker 2 architecture?
