# [Federated Unlearning for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using sensors has become widespread in various domains. Federated Learning (FL) is often used to build HAR models by aggregating user contributions without transmitting raw user data. However, regulations like GDPR give users the right to request removal of their data from models, raising a challenge for FL: how can a client request HAR data removal without compromising others' privacy? Existing methods like retraining the model from scratch are resource intensive. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a lightweight machine unlearning method to selectively remove a client's HAR data from an FL model. The key ideas are:

1) Use a third-party dataset unrelated to model training and employ KL divergence as a loss to fine-tune the model. This aligns the predicted probability distribution on the forgotten data with that of the third-party data.

2) Balance unlearning with preserving model performance on remaining client data by optimizing an overall loss function.

3) Introduce membership inference attack evaluation to assess unlearning efficacy.

Contributions:

1) Lightweight HAR data unlearning method for FL that attains comparable accuracy to retraining approaches but with hundreds to thousands times speedup.

2) Validation on 2 HAR datasets and MNIST shows method successfully forgets target data while largely preserving model performance.

3) Pioneering solution for enabling right to be forgotten in Federated Learning for Human Activity Recognition applications. Helps enhance privacy protection for users.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in presenting an efficient unlearning technique tailored to enable data removal rights for HAR applications built using Federated Learning frameworks. The proposed approach balances effectiveness, performance and significant computational/communication gains.
