# [Re-Search for The Truth: Multi-round Retrieval-augmented Large Language   Models are Strong Fake News Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Proliferation of fake news poses severe threats to society. Existing fake news detection methods have limitations in scalability, transferability and robustness.  
- Evidence-based methods rely on static repositories with outdated/incomplete data. LLMs also struggle with stale knowledge and poor evidence retrieval.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce STEEL - a strategic retrieval-enhanced LLM framework for fake news detection.
- Leverages reasoning of LLMs and automates evidence extraction from the expansive Internet instead of a fixed corpus.
- Employs an adaptive multi-round retrieval approach. LLMs generate queries for missing info when initial evidence is insufficient.
- Delivers accurate verdicts and human-readable explanations for enhanced interpretability.

Key Contributions:
- First framework combining strategic Internet-based evidence retrieval with LLMs for fake news detection.
- Out-of-the-box implementation without need for complicated data processing or model training.
- Comprehensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both prediction accuracy and interpretability.

In summary, this paper presents an automated fake news detection framework called STEEL that strategically extracts evidence from the Internet over multiple rounds. By leveraging LLMs and adaptive retrieval, it delivers highly accurate and interpretable verdicts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of this novel approach.
