# [Robust Influence-based Training Methods for Noisy Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately classifying brain tumors from MRI scans is critical for proper diagnosis and treatment planning. 
- Most existing methods assume noise-free training data, but collecting clean MRIs is challenging. Noisy data significantly degrades classifier performance.  
- Therefore, the paper studies the realistic but difficult problem of training deep learning models on noisy MRI data to classify brain tumors.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two training methods robust to noisy MRI data - Influence-based Sample Reweighing (ISR) and Influence-based Sample Perturbation (ISP).
- Both methods use influence functions from robust statistics to identify helpful vs harmful training examples.
- ISR adaptively reweighs training examples based on influence scores to focus learning on helpful examples.  
- ISP crafts helpful perturbations proportional to influence scores and injects them into a subset of influential training samples to make the model robust.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the realistic problem of training on noisy brain tumor MRI data.
- Proposes two efficient robust training methods using influence functions - ISR and ISP.
- ISR reweighs training examples according to impact on validation loss estimated via influence scores.
- ISP adds helpful perturbations to influential training examples based on influence scores.
- Empirically demonstrates ISR and ISP can train deep learning models robust to noisy training data without affecting generalization performance.

In summary, the paper addresses the practical but challenging issue of training on noisy medical images. The proposed influence-based methods can train robust models efficiently without requiring additional clean data.
