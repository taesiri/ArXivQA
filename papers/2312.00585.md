# [Adaptive Parameter-Free Robust Learning using Latent Bernoulli Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00585)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new robust learning approach called RLVI that can effectively handle corrupted training data. RLVI introduces latent Bernoulli variables to identify corrupted and non-corrupted samples, allowing the formulation of a marginal likelihood objective where these variables are marginalized out. This avoids having to specify the level of corruption a priori. RLVI maximizes a variational lower bound on this marginal likelihood via an efficient Expectation-Maximization algorithm. For settings involving stochastic optimization like online and deep learning, they derive a truncation mechanism to prevent overfitting to outliers. Experiments across diverse machine learning tasks demonstrate RLVI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods for learning with corrupted data. Key strengths are its general applicability, automation in handling varying noise levels, and introducing minimal overhead over standard likelihood optimization. The method thus provides an efficient way to achieve robustness across model types and learning scenarios involving contaminated training data.
