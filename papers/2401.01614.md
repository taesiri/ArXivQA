# [GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Web agents need to be able to visually perceive websites and follow natural language instructions to complete tasks. This requires both understanding the visuals and generating appropriate action plans.
- Existing methods rely primarily on text-only models operating on HTML code, which is noisy and incomplete. Leveraging rendered visuals is more informative but also more complex.
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V have shown remarkable vision-language capabilities, presenting an opportunity for stronger web agents.

Proposed Solution - SeeAct:  
- Develop a generalist web agent called SeeAct based on GPT-4V to integrate visual understanding and acting on websites.  
- Formulate the problem as action generation to produce plan text and element grounding to map the plan to executable actions.
- Explore multiple grounding strategies like bounding boxes on images or textual choices.
- Enable online evaluation on live websites with a new tool.

Main Contributions:
- Show GPT-4V can successfully complete 50% of tasks on live websites given oracle grounding, substantially outperforming GPT-4 (20%) and smaller models like FLAN-T5 (18%).
- Grounding remains a major challenge with a 20-25% gap to oracle grounding. The best strategy leverages both HTML text and visuals.   
- In-context learning generalizes better while supervised fine-tuning has an edge for seen websites.
- Important discrepancy between online and offline evaluation due to multiple viable plans for tasks.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of LMMs for web agents but grounding and evaluation methodology remain open challenges for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes SeeAct, a generalist web agent based on GPT-4V that shows strong potential for visually understanding websites and generating correct action plans, but still struggles with grounding those plans precisely into executable actions on webpages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors propose SeeAct, a generalist web agent that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V for integrated visual understanding and acting on websites. 

2) They evaluate SeeAct on the Mind2Web benchmark and establish a new online evaluation setting using a tool they developed that allows running web agents on live websites.

3) Through experiments, they demonstrate the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V for web agents - with oracle grounding, GPT-4V can successfully complete 50% of tasks on live websites, substantially outperforming text-only models like GPT-4 or smaller multimodal models. 

4) They analyze the major bottleneck of grounding and show that the best grounding strategy organically leverages both HTML text and visuals, outperforming image annotation strategies that have been effective on natural images.

5) They highlight the discrepancy between online and offline evaluation, emphasizing the need for online evaluation to accurately assess a model's capabilities as a web agent.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing SeeAct as a web agent based on LMMs, evaluating it comprehensively offline and online, analyzing the bottlenecks, and highlighting the potential as well as current limitations of LMMs as generalist web agents.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Large multimodal models (LMMs): Refers to large-scale models like GPT-4V and Gemini that are trained on image-text data to develop integrated visual and language understanding abilities.

- Generalist web agent: An agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks across diverse real-world websites.

- Action generation: The capability of an agent to produce textual descriptions of actions needed to complete a task. 

- Element grounding: The process of mapping the textual action descriptions to specific UI elements and operations to execute.

- Online evaluation: Assessing agent performance by having them attempt tasks on live websites, as opposed to cached websites in offline evaluation.

- Visual grounding: Converting high-level textual descriptions into precise references to visual elements, a key capability for web agents operating on rendered webpages.

- Set-of-mark prompting: An annotation strategy that overlays visual cues like bounding boxes onto images to aid in visual grounding.

- HTML-visual correspondence: Leveraging the known mapping between HTML code and visual UI elements rendered on a webpage.

In summary, the key focus of this paper is exploring LMMs like GPT-4V as generalist web agents, with a particular emphasis on tackling the visual grounding challenge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes SeeAct, a generalist web agent based on large multimodal models like GPT-4V. How does SeeAct leverage both visual and textual understanding for completing tasks on websites compared to prior web agents based solely on text?

2. The paper identifies grounding, especially element grounding, as a major challenge for SeeAct. What are the key limitations of the three grounding strategies explored - grounding via element attributes, textual choices, and image annotation? How do they compare?

3. The paper shows a substantial performance gap between SeeAct's grounding strategies and oracle grounding provided by humans. What are some reasons this gap exists? What ideas does the paper propose for future work to help close this gap?

4. What unique properties of websites, compared to natural images, does the paper identify that could be better leveraged for improving grounding and reducing hallucinations from the LMM?

5. The paper establishes a new online evaluation setting and tool for assessing web agents on live websites. What are some key differences observed between online and offline evaluation? Why does the paper argue online evaluation is more indicative of a model's true capabilities?

6. What evidence does the paper provide that shows in-context learning with large models has better generalization ability on unseen websites compared to supervised fine-tuning? When does supervised fine-tuning have an edge?

7. The paper analyzes the performance on tasks of varying difficulties. What trend is observed regarding whole task success rate vs number of actions? What does this suggest about the model's capabilities and limitations?

8. What examples does the paper provide that showcase GPT-4V's capabilities beyond supervised models, like long-range planning, error correction, and reasoning requiring knowledge?

9. The paper identifies several major types of visual hallucination errors made by GPT-4V during grounding via image annotation. Can you describe these different types of errors and why they happen?

10. The paper argues that grounding via textual choices, despite being the best performing method, still faces challenges due to identical elements in webpages. How could this issue be addressed in future work while retaining the advantages of textual choices?
