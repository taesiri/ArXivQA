# [Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram   Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to create a text-to-speech system that can synthesize natural sounding speech directly from text, without relying on complex feature engineering or traditional speech synthesis pipelines. 

Specifically, the paper proposes an end-to-end neural network model called Tacotron 2 that combines a sequence-to-sequence model to generate mel spectrograms from text, and a modified WaveNet model to synthesize time-domain waveforms from the mel spectrograms.

The key hypothesis is that using mel spectrograms as an intermediate acoustic representation between the text and waveform can bridge these two components in a single neural network model to produce speech that approaches human quality. The experiments aim to validate whether this approach can actually synthesize natural sounding speech comparable to real human recordings.

So in summary, the main research question is whether an end-to-end neural model conditioned on mel spectrograms can achieve state-of-the-art text-to-speech synthesis, removing the need for hand-engineered linguistic and acoustic features of traditional TTS systems. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this mel spectrogram-based approach through systematic experiments and evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of Tacotron 2, an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis system that achieves human-level speech quality. The key ideas are:

- Using a sequence-to-sequence model with attention to generate mel spectrograms from text. This replaces the traditional linguistic feature extraction pipeline.

- Using a modified WaveNet model as a neural vocoder to generate time-domain waveforms from the mel spectrograms. This replaces the traditional vocoder and waveform generation components. 

- Showing that using mel spectrograms as the intermediate acoustic representation between text and audio allows for a simplified and high-quality end-to-end model.

- Achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 for Tacotron 2, which is close to a MOS of 4.58 for real human speech. This demonstrates the system's ability to synthesize natural sounding speech.

- Conducting ablation studies to validate the design choices such as using mel spectrograms, the post-processing network, and simplifying WaveNet.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting Tacotron 2 as a unified neural model that achieves human-level speech synthesis directly from text, while previous approaches relied on complex linguistic feature engineering or separate components.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving prosody modeling: The authors note there is still room for improvement in prosody modeling, as some generated samples had issues like unnatural emphasis or pitch. They suggest further work on modeling prosody.

- Using different intermediate acoustic representations: The authors suggest exploring the trade-off between number of mel frequency bins and audio quality. Using other compact intermediate representations could also be explored.

- Testing generalization on more out-of-domain data: The authors note the challenge of end-to-end approaches requiring training data covering intended usage. They suggest testing generalization ability on more diverse out-of-domain data. 

- Incorporating other conditioning inputs: The authors suggest it may be possible to incorporate other conditioning inputs like linguistic features along with the mel spectrograms to improve results.

- Exploring unconditional models: The authors suggest exploring unconditional models that don't require an input text sequence.

- Reducing computational complexity: The authors show WaveNet complexity can be reduced substantially while maintaining quality. Further work could aim to optimize this trade-off.

In summary, key future directions are improving prosody, testing other acoustic representations, improving generalization, adding conditioning inputs, exploring unconditional models, and reducing complexity. The authors lay out several promising paths for advancing end-to-end TTS.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents Tacotron 2, a neural text-to-speech synthesis system that can directly generate speech from text. The system has two main components - a recurrent sequence-to-sequence model that generates mel spectrogram predictions from input text, and a modified WaveNet model that acts as a vocoder to convert the mel spectrograms into time-domain waveforms. The mel spectrogram representation bridges the two components, allowing them to be trained separately. Tacotron 2 outperforms prior Tacotron and WaveNet TTS systems in terms of naturalness, achieving a mean opinion score comparable to recorded speech. Ablation studies validate the model design choices, showing the importance of the spectrogram prediction network, mel spectrogram features, and post-processing network to achieving this performance. The paper demonstrates that an end-to-end neural approach to TTS can match the quality of the best traditional TTS systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Tacotron 2, a neural network architecture for text-to-speech synthesis that combines a sequence-to-sequence model with a modified WaveNet vocoder. The sequence-to-sequence model converts input text to mel spectrograms, while the WaveNet model converts the mel spectrograms to time-domain waveforms. 

The sequence-to-sequence model uses an encoder, attention, and decoder architecture. The encoder converts characters to hidden representations using convolutional layers and a bi-directional LSTM. Attention summarizes the encoder outputs into a context vector for each decoder step. The decoder is an autoregressive RNN that predicts mel spectrogram frames from the encoded input and attention context. A WaveNet model with simplified dilated convolution then converts these spectrograms to audio. Experiments show the model achieves a 4.53 MOS score on an internal US English dataset, close to human quality. Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of various model design decisions. The model advances text-to-speech quality while simplifying the traditional pipeline.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Tacotron 2, an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis system that combines two neural network models. The first is a sequence-to-sequence model that converts text to mel-scale spectrograms, which are a compact intermediate acoustic representation. It uses an encoder-decoder architecture with attention to generate mel spectrograms from text. The second model is a modified WaveNet that acts as a neural vocoder to convert the mel spectrograms to time-domain audio waveforms. By conditioning the WaveNet model on mel spectrograms instead of linguistic features, the authors are able to significantly simplify the WaveNet architecture while still achieving high-quality speech synthesis comparable to real human speech. The two models are trained separately - the sequence-to-sequence model on text and spectrograms, and then the WaveNet model on the predicted spectrograms and matching audio. This approach allows Tacotron 2 to generate natural sounding speech directly from text using end-to-end neural networks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating natural sounding speech directly from text. The key questions it seems to be tackling are:

- How can we build an end-to-end text-to-speech system that generates high quality and natural sounding speech without relying on complex linguistic feature engineering?
