# [Compressive Recovery of Signals Defined on Perturbed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07637)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of recovering a graph signal from compressive measurements when there is uncertainty in the graph topology. Specifically, the actual underlying graph topology is unknown. Only a nominal graph with a few edge perturbations relative to the actual graph is available. However, the graph signal is sparse in the graph Fourier basis of the actual unknown graph. Recovering the signal using just the nominal graph leads to poor accuracy. Hence, there is a need to simultaneously recover the actual graph topology along with the original graph signal from the compressive measurements.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents two main algorithms - Greedy Edge Selection (GES) and Inferred Linear-Edge Compressive Image Recovery (ILECIR):

1. GES starts with the nominal graph and greedily perturbs its edges based on cross-validation errors to refine the topology and signal estimate. At each step, it considers adding/removing single edges and picks the one giving lowest CV error on held-out measurements, as long as the error reduces considerably.

2. ILECIR is proposed for the scenario where a 2D image is acquired compressively in patches, and modeled as a graph signal on a 2D lattice graph. Dropped graph edges represent discontinuities corresponding to image edges. ILECIR tries partitioning the lattice graph with different candidate image edges, computes GFT bases for these partitioned graphs, and picks the one giving lowest CV error for recovery.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the novel Compressive Perturbed Graph Recovery problem to handle uncertainty in graph topology during compressed sensing of graph signals.

- Two algorithms - GES and ILECIR - to address this problem in a generic graph setting and for images respectively.

- Theoretical guarantee that under certain conditions, the algorithms provably improve upon just using the nominal graph, and recover the ground truth given enough measurements.

- Extensive experiments showing considerable gains over baseline methods ignoring graph uncertainty, for signals on various standard graph models and images from four diverse datasets.

So in summary, the paper makes notable contributions in robust compressed sensing by accounting for errors in the graph topology, via a graph refinement approach using cross-validation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel method for the compressive recovery of graph signals defined on nodes of a graph, when the actual underlying graph topology is not known exactly and only a perturbed "nominal" graph is available, by greedily refining the nominal graph topology based on cross-validation errors of candidate signals recovered using different graph Fourier transforms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It formulates a new problem called the Compressive Perturbed Graph Recovery (CPGR) problem, where the goal is to recover a graph signal from compressive measurements when the underlying graph topology is not known exactly and contains a small number of edge perturbations relative to a nominal graph. This problem has not been explored before in the literature.

2. It presents a greedy algorithm called Greedy Edge Selection (GES) to solve the CPGR problem by iteratively refining the nominal graph topology based on cross-validation errors of candidate graphs on held-out measurements.

3. For image patch recovery, it presents an algorithm called Inferred Linear-Edge Compressive Image Recovery (Ilecir) which recovers images along with linear image edges in each patch by dropping edges from a 2D lattice graph. 

4. It provides theoretical guarantees on signal and graph recovery for a brute-force version of the algorithms, as well as guarantees on solution improvement at each step of GES and Ilecir.

5. It validates the proposed methods extensively on synthetic graphs and images, showing improved recovery over using just the nominal graph or first-order approximations to the perturbed eigenvectors. An application to compressive image recovery is also shown.

In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of the novel CPGR problem and the proposal of practical greedy algorithms to solve it using model selection based on cross-validation errors. This is supported by theory and extensive experiments.

The paper presents a novel method called "Greedy Edge Selection" (GES) for recovering signals defined on graphs with a small number of edge perturbations, from compressive measurements. It formulates the problem of robust graph signal recovery with incorrectly specified edge connections as an optimization problem exploiting signal sparsity in the GFT domain. Cross-validation is used to guide the greedy graph refinement steps. Extensive experiments are presented applying the method to synthetic graph signals and images, using the image lattice graph structure. So the key focus is around compressive sensing, graph signal processing, and perturbed graph recovery using greedy optimization and model selection type approaches.
