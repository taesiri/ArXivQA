# [Multimodal ArXiv: A Dataset for Improving Scientific Comprehension of   Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00231)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of Multimodal ArXiv, a new dataset comprising ArXivCap and ArXivQA to enhance the scientific comprehension abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Specifically:

- ArXivCap is a large-scale figure-caption dataset with 6.4 million images and 3.9 million captions extracted from 572K arXiv papers across diverse scientific domains. It has both single and multiple subfigure examples.

- ArXivQA contains 100K multiple-choice QA pairs generated by instructing GPT-4V to create questions based on 35K sample figures from ArXivCap.

2) Demonstrating the efficacy of ArXivQA in boosting LVLMs' performance on the MathVista benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning. Fine-tuning on ArXivQA led to a 10.4% absolute accuracy increase.

3) Defining 4 vision-to-text tasks of varying complexity using ArXivCap to evaluate LVLMs' ability to comprehend academic figures: single-figure captioning, multiple-figure captioning, contextualized captioning, and title generation. Detailed experiments highlight current challenges and show substantial gains from domain-specific training.

4) In-depth analysis including per-domain performance breakdown and manual error categorization revealing limitations of existing LVLMs in terms of misinterpreting context, recognition errors, and oversimplification.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of the Multimodal ArXiv datasets to enhance and benchmark scientific comprehension for LVLMs, validated through quantitative experiments and qualitative analysis.
