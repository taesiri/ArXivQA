# [Robust and Scalable Model Editing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have vast amounts of knowledge encoded in their parameters. However, this parametric knowledge may be inconsistent with real-world knowledge or lead to undesired behaviors. 
- Existing methods for editing LLMs require access to model parameters/gradients, making them inapplicable to deployed black-box LLMs. 
- Recently proposed in-context editing methods have limitations in scalability, robustness to irrelevant edits, and combining knowledge from multiple edits.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EREN, a framework to edit black-box LLMs by having them read edit notes.  
- Edits are stored as short natural language notes in a growing notebook memory.
- For each input, relevant notes are retrieved and used to prompt the LLM to make grounded predictions. If no notes are relevant, the LLM relies on its parametric knowledge.
- A two-step retrieval process is used for scalability and to avoid negative impacts of irrelevant notes.

Main Contributions:
- Show that instruction-tuned LLMs can reliably give precedence to contextual knowledge over parametric knowledge.
- Propose EREN, a scalable and robust in-context editing method that handles large/irrelevant edits and combines knowledge from multiple edits.
- Release cleaned and more challenging datasets for evaluating model editors.
- Empirically demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of EREN, significantly outperforming existing methods. EREN edits black-box LLMs without retraining or access to parameters.

In summary, the paper addresses key challenges in editing black-box LLMs via an intuitive prompting-based approach, enabling users to efficiently modify LLMs' behavior without expensive retraining.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes EREN, a scalable and robust method for editing the behavior of large language models by prompting them to read relevant edits from an expandable notebook and give precedence to the contextual knowledge over their innate knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It conducts experiments to show that instruction-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to give precedence to contextual knowledge over parametric knowledge. 

2. It proposes EREN, a robust and scalable in-context model editing method that can handle large numbers of edits and irrelevant edits. EREN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

3. It processes and releases cleaner and more challenging versions of existing datasets for model editing, and shows that existing methods see drastic performance drops on the new challenging examples introduced.

The paper proposes a new method called EREN (Edit models by REading Notes) for robust and scalable in-context editing of large language models. The key ideas involve using instruction tuning to make models give precedence to contextual knowledge, determining edit relevance through reading comprehension, and scaling to large numbers of edits using a note retrieval system. Evaluation is performed on question answering and fact checking datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does EREN propose to scale model editing to a large number of edits without running into issues with long input contexts? What mechanism allows it to bring in only relevant edits as needed?

2. What was the key insight that led the authors to design a two-step relevance estimation process for determining which edits are relevant? Why is this more robust than existing approaches? 

3. How does EREN leverage instruction tuning of language models to improve controllability and robustness to irrelevant edits in the context? What specifically does instruction tuning help with?

4. Why does concatenating multiple edits as context pose problems for language models? How does EREN get around this limitation to support combining knowledge from multiple edits? 

5. The paper argues EREN represents a significant step towards lifelong maintenance of LLMs. What specifically about the approach makes this feasible and what are some remaining challenges?

6. What modifications were made to existing datasets used for evaluation like CounterFact and FEVER to create more challenging test cases? How did this impact performance?

7. How does the rough relevance estimation stage filter down edits before the main reader model determines final relevance? What tradeoffs are being made?

8. Why can overlaying edits sequentially cause catastrophic forgetting in gradient-based editing methods? How does EREN avoid this problem?

9. How was the editing capability transferred to LLMs like GPT-3.5? What adjustments or additional prompts were needed?

10. The paper focuses on sequential editing - why is this more challenging than simultaneous editing? What assumptions does EREN make about order and combination of edits?
