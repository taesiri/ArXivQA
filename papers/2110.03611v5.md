# [Adversarial Retriever-Ranker for dense text retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03611v5)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents an adversarial retriever-ranker framework called AR2 for dense text retrieval. 

The main research questions/hypotheses it aims to address are:

1. How to improve the performance of dense retrievers by addressing the issues of false negatives in contrastive learning and lack of fine-grained query-document interactions in dual-encoder models?

2. How to jointly optimize the retriever and ranker models in an end-to-end retrieve-then-rank pipeline, instead of training them independently?

3. Whether a minimax adversarial training approach can be an effective strategy for jointly training the retriever and ranker, where the retriever tries to retrieve hard negatives to fool the ranker, while the ranker provides progressive feedback signals to improve the retriever.

The key hypothesis is that the proposed adversarial retriever-ranker framework can consistently and significantly improve the performance of dense retrievers by addressing the limitations of existing methods. The results on three benchmark datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA, MS-MARCO) seem to validate this hypothesis and show new state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the main research focus is on developing a novel adversarial training approach to jointly optimize the retriever and ranker in an end-to-end manner to improve the accuracy of dense text retrieval.
