# [COVIDHealth: A Benchmark Twitter Dataset and Machine Learning based Web   Application for Classifying COVID-19 Discussions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- COVID-19 pandemic has impacted both physical and mental health. Many studies analyze health perspectives from social media, but lack focus on specific health aspects like risks and transmission.
- No existing study collectively focuses on categorizing COVID-19 related discussions on health risks, prevention, symptoms, transmission, and treatment.
- There is a need for an automated system to classify COVID-19 health discussions on social media to help address public health challenges.

Proposed Solution: 
- Collect COVID-19 related Twitter data and manually label it into 5 categories: health risks, prevention, symptoms, transmission, and treatment.
- Preprocess data and address class imbalance using oversampling and undersampling techniques.  
- Extract features using LIWC, TF-IDF, and POS tag methods. Apply 7 traditional ML models and 4 deep learning models.
- Develop a web application using the best performing model to showcase real-world applicability.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce new labeled COVID-19 Twitter dataset focused specifically on health aspects.
- Provide benchmark classification results using variety of ML and deep learning methods.  
- Develop usable web application prototype as a Chrome extension for classifying COVID-19 discussions.
- Offer standardized framework for classifying health expressions in Twitter data.
- Findings provide insights to utilize social media data for public health, especially during global health crises.

In summary, the paper presents a meticulous study of classifying COVID-19 health discussions on Twitter to ultimately contribute towards harnessing social media for public health objectives, while also providing an implementable automated classification system.
