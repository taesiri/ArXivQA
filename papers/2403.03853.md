# [ShortGPT: Layers in Large Language Models are More Redundant Than You   Expect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) require massive compute and memory resources due to their gigantic size. However, many layers in LLMs exhibit redundancy, indicating opportunities for model compression.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a metric called Block Influence (BI) to quantify the influence of each layer on the model's hidden state transformations. 
- Layers with low BI scores are redundant and contribute minimally to model performance. The paper proposes a straightforward pruning technique called ShortGPT that removes such redundant layers based on their BI scores.

Main Contributions:  
- The paper reveals significant redundancy at the layer level in LLMs. For example, removing 25% of layers in a 13B parameter LLM causes just a 5% drop in performance.
- ShortGPT outperforms prior state-of-the-art pruning methods. It can maintain 95% of model performance while reducing 25% of parameters and computation.
- Analysis shows most redundancy exists across layers rather than across width (attention heads). 
- The simplicity of ShortGPT highlights the redundancy, suggesting opportunities to train more efficient LLM architectures. 
- ShortGPT is compatible with other techniques like quantization for further compression.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel metric BI to identify redundant layers in LLMs. Leveraging this, ShortGPT removes layers based on BI scores, providing superior pruning performance versus complexity trade-offs. The analysis also unveils substantial layer redundancy in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a straightforward and effective pruning method for large language models by directly removing redundant layers based on a Block Influence metric, demonstrating significant parameter and computation reduction with minimal accuracy drop.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It analyzes the redundancy in large language models (LLMs) and finds that they exhibit significant redundancy at the layer level. This inspires the idea of pruning LLMs by simply removing redundant layers.

2. It proposes a metric called Block Influence (BI) to effectively measure the importance of each layer in LLMs. Through analysis, it shows that LLMs have redundancy both in depth (layers) and width (parameters within layers).  

3. Based on the BI metric, it proposes a simple yet effective pruning method called ShortGPT that removes low BI score layers. Experiments show this method maintains 92% performance while reducing approximately 25% of parameters and computation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

4. It demonstrates that the layer pruning approach is orthogonal to quantization methods, meaning it can be combined with quantization to further reduce LLM deployment overhead.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple and effective layer removal based pruning method for large language models, enabled by the discovery of significant layer-level redundancy in LLMs.

The paper analyzes redundancy in large language models, specifically at the layer level. It introduces a "Block Influence" metric to gauge layer importance and proposes a straightforward layer removal/deletion approach guided by BI to prune redundant layers. This pruning strategy significantly reduces parameters and inference costs while maintaining strong performance on benchmarks. The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques and is compatible with quantization for further optimizations. Overall, the key focus is on exploiting layer-wise redundancy to enable simple yet effective pruning for efficient LLM deployment.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called "Block Influence (BI)" to measure the importance of each layer in a large language model. How is BI calculated and why is it a good indicator of a layer's significance? 

2. The findings show there is substantial redundancy at the layer level in large language models. What evidence and analysis supports this claim of layer-wise redundancy? Expand on the empirical support.

3. The paper demonstrates that simply removing layers based on low BI scores leads to better performance than more complex state-of-the-art pruning methods. Why might directly removing layers be more effective than other techniques in this context?

4. Figure 5 shows that the BI pruning method outperforms others as the pruning ratio increases. Analyze the differences and discuss why BI allows for more aggressive pruning.  

5. The results suggest current LLMs exhibit more depth redundancy than width redundancy. Compare and contrast the depth vs width redundancy analyses. Why might models demonstrate greater redundancy across layers?

6. Experiments showed the RWKV model, a non-transformer architecture, also displays significant depth redundancy. What implications does this have for the universality of layer redundancy in large language models?

7. The paper combines layer pruning with weight quantization, showing orthogonality. Explain how these two techniques differ in compressing models and why their combination enables further reduction.  

8. The performance drop is much more significant on generative tasks than discriminative tasks after layer removal. Analyze the potential reasons behind this discrepancy.

9. While layer importance metrics like relative magnitude were competitive, BI still outperformed. Evaluate the differences between the importance scoring techniques explored.  

10. The paper prunes English and Chinese models. Discuss any differences observed in terms of redundancy and pruning effectiveness across languages or datasets.
