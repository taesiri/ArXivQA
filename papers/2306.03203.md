# [A Static Evaluation of Code Completion by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03203)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we effectively evaluate code completion suggestions from large language models using static analysis instead of execution-based methods?The key points related to this question are:- Execution-based evaluation of model-generated code is accurate but expensive and focused on simple problems. Static analysis with linters can complement it by catching a wide range of errors efficiently without running code.- The authors propose a pipeline to statically analyze errors in model-generated Python code completions using AST parsing and the Pyflakes linter.- They apply this pipeline to evaluate completions from CodeGen models on a new real-world function completion benchmark with 100K examples.- The analysis reveals common errors like undefined names and unused variables, as well as how factors like temperature, model scale, and context impact errors.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that static analysis can efficiently evaluate code generation models on complex real-world code, in order to understand their weaknesses and improve their quality. The paper presents evidence for this via the proposed analysis pipeline and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a static evaluation framework to detect errors in code completions generated by large language models. The key components are parsing code snippets into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and then analyzing them using the Pyflakes static analysis tool.2. Building a dataset of 100K Python function completion problems by sampling from open source GitHub repos. This simulates real-world usage of code auto-completion. 3. Evaluating public large language models (e.g. CodeGen) by generating 1 million completions on this dataset. The static analysis reveals common errors made by the models, like undefined names and unused variables.4. Showing the effects of various factors on errors through experiments, including sampling temperature, model size, and errors existing in the input context. For example, higher temperatures lead to more errors, while larger models help with some error types but not all.5. Providing insights into weaknesses of current code generation models, which can inform future research to improve code quality and accuracy.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel static analysis framework for evaluating code generation models, and using it to analyze errors in a large scale experiment on real-world Python code. The findings reveal strengths and weaknesses of existing models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to related work in code completion evaluation:- The paper focuses on static analysis for evaluating code completions, rather than execution-based evaluation which has been more common. Static analysis is more efficient and can handle real-world code, but cannot evaluate functional correctness.- The function completion dataset from GitHub repositories is more realistic than many existing benchmark datasets that use algorithmic problems or synthetic examples. Evaluating on real-world code is important.- The analysis examines a broad range of static error types using the Pyflakes tool. Many prior works have focused on only detecting a few specific bug types. - The large scale evaluation on 1 million completions provides insights on how factors like model scale, temperature, and context impact different error rates. Most prior work evaluates on much smaller samples.- The paper demonstrates the value in leveraging existing static analysis tools to evaluate generative models. Others have proposed developing specialized analysis methods for code generation.Overall, the key novelties seem to be the more realistic evaluation dataset, the large scale static analysis across error types, and insights on how model and data factors correlate with bugs. The findings on errors like undefined names highlight challenges for current models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods to guide language models to generate code that is compatible with the target Python version or environment, given the limitations around interpreter version mismatches they observed.- Exploring the use of right-side and cross-file context when evaluating code completions, to better determine certain error categories. - Evaluating code generations using additional static analysis tools beyond Pyflakes, to cover a broader range of potential code issues and errors.- Designing techniques to reduce the occurrence of certain error types identified in their analysis, such as undefined names or unused variables, to improve overall code quality.- Considering not just syntactic correctness but also semantic correctness when evaluating model generations.- Expanding the analysis to additional programming languages beyond Python.- Investigating ways to mitigate models amplifying errors found in the input context.So in summary, some key directions are improving version compatibility, using more context, leveraging additional static analysis tools, reducing specific error types, evaluating semantic correctness, broadening to more languages, and addressing error amplification from context. The authors' analysis provides a useful starting point to understand current model weaknesses and motivate future research to address them.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a static evaluation framework to quantify static errors in Python code completions generated by large language models. The method utilizes abstract syntax trees and the Pyflakes static analyzer. The authors collect 100K function completion examples from open source repositories and evaluate public models by sampling 1 million completions. The analysis reveals undefined names and unused variables are the most common errors. Higher temperature leads to more errors while larger models reduce some error types but not undefined names. The study also shows errors in context correlate with errors in generation. Overall, the work provides insights into weaknesses of existing models through efficient static analysis rather than costly execution. It highlights directions to improve code generation quality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a static evaluation framework to quantify errors in Python code completions generated by large language models. The method parses code snippets into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and analyzes them using the Pyflakes static analysis tool. This allows efficient evaluation of code completions at scale compared to execution-based techniques. The framework is applied to public models like CodeGen on a dataset of 100K Python function completion problems sampled from open source code. Analysis reveals the most frequent errors are Undefined Name and Unused Variable. Experiments show higher temperature leads to more errors, while larger models reduce some error types but not others like undefined names. The impact of errors in the prompt context on errors in the generated code is also analyzed. Overall, the work provides insights into strengths and weaknesses of language models through comprehensive static analysis.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a static evaluation framework to quantify errors in Python code completions generated by language models. The method involves collecting real-world Python code contexts from open source repositories and masking out function bodies to create a test set of function completion problems. For each problem, multiple completions are sampled from language models and evaluated. The completions are parsed into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to identify syntax errors. If no syntax errors are found, a static analysis tool called Pyflakes is run on the ASTs to detect other common errors like undefined variables. By comparing errors found in the original context versus the full code with completion, errors introduced by the language model can be identified. This allows aggregating statistics on different error types made by the models across thousands of test cases. The efficiency of static analysis enables evaluating on a large scale compared to expensive execution-based testing.
