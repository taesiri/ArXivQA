# [Enhanced Hallucination Detection in Neural Machine Translation through   Simple Detector Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13331)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural machine translation (NMT) systems sometimes generate hallucinated translations that are detached from the source content. These translations can have serious consequences when NMT systems are deployed in the real world.  
- Prior work has shown that different hallucination detectors excel at catching different types of hallucinations. There is an inherent trade-off between detectors in terms of the diverse anomalies they can identify.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a simple yet effective method called STARE to aggregate multiple complementary hallucination detectors to improve overall detection performance. 
- STARE first normalizes the scores from each detector using min-max normalization over a reference dataset. 
- It then aggregates the normalized scores through a weighted average to produce a final score that outperforms any individual detector.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes STARE, a straightforward unsupervised detector aggregation method that combines complementary strengths of different hallucination detectors.
- Shows state-of-the-art performance on two widely used hallucination detection benchmarks.
- Demonstrates that combining just two complementary detectors via STARE can outperform the best individual detectors. 
- Finds that aggregated model-internal detectors can exceed performance of best individual external detector on one dataset.
- Shows the impact of reference dataset size on normalization for STARE vs baseline methods.
- Provides extensive experiments analyzing aggregation of model-internal vs external detectors and ablations.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards more reliable NMT by enhancing hallucination detection through effectively aggregating complementary detectors in an unsupervised manner. The simple yet high-performing STARE method consistently outperforms prior baselines and individual detectors.
