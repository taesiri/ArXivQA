# [Improving Unsupervised Relation Extraction by Augmenting Diverse   Sentence Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00552)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes AugURE, a novel approach for unsupervised relation extraction (URE) that focuses on improving relation representation learning through positive pair augmentation and a more suitable loss function. Specifically, AugURE increases the diversity of positive pairs via two augmentation techniques: within-sentence pairs using intermediate word sampling and entity replacement, and cross-sentence pairs extracted using an OpenIE model, NLI entailment, and ChatGPT rewriting. These augmented diverse positive pairs strengthen the discriminative power of contrastive learning. Additionally, the paper identifies limitations of the prevalent noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) loss for URE tasks, and instead proposes a more robust margin loss to better capture the similarity spectrum for relation representations. Experiments on the NYT-FB and TACRED datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for AugURE. The consistency of improvements verifies the efficacy of the proposed representation learning techniques and loss function across domains and label noise levels. Overall, the paper offers valuable insights on enhancing unsupervised relation extraction through positive pair augmentation and choice of loss function.
