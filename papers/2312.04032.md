# [RoAST: Robustifying Language Models via Adversarial Perturbation with   Selective Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04032)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new fine-tuning technique called RoAST (Robustifying Language Models via Adversarial perturbation with Selective Training) to enhance the robustness of pre-trained language models across multiple perspectives. RoAST incorporates adversarial training to improve robustness to perturbed inputs, while using a selective training scheme to preserve generalizable knowledge from the pre-training. Specifically, RoAST adds adversarial noise to the inputs during fine-tuning and selectively updates model parameters based on their importance for the task, focusing updates on the most critical parameters while avoiding overwriting useful general knowledge. Through experiments on sentiment classification and entailment tasks, RoAST is shown to outperform strong baselines by improving accuracy, distribution shift generalization, adversarial robustness, calibration, and anomaly detection in a unified way. Detailed analysis provides insight into how RoAST balances learning task-specific knowledge and preserving useful information from pre-training for enhanced robustness. By effectively combining adversarial training and selective model updating, RoAST serves as an easy-to-implement, unified fine-tuning approach to boost model reliability across diverse robustness metrics on multiple language understanding tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called RoAST that robustifies language models via adversarial perturbation during fine-tuning while selectively updating model parameters based on their relative importance to preserve generalizable knowledge from pre-training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique called RoAST (Robustifying LMs via Adversarial perturbation with Selective Training) to enhance the multi-perspective robustness of language models. Specifically, RoAST incorporates adversarial training to improve robustness on perturbed inputs and selective model training to preserve generalizable knowledge from pre-training. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that RoAST significantly outperforms existing methods in improving language models' robustness across multiple perspectives like distribution shift generalization, adversarial robustness, model calibration, and anomaly detection. The unified framework and superior empirical performance highlight RoAST's usefulness as an efficient approach to build reliable language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Language models
- Fine-tuning 
- Robustness
- Adversarial perturbation
- Selective training
- Multi-perspective robustness
- Distribution shift generalization
- Adversarial robustness
- Model calibration
- Anomaly detection

The paper proposes a method called "RoAST" which stands for Robustifying Language Models via Adversarial perturbation with Selective Training. The key goal is to enhance the robustness of fine-tuned language models from multiple perspectives in a unified manner. This includes making them more robust to distribution shifts, adversarial examples, better calibrated, and better at anomaly detection. The two key techniques used are adversarial training to make the models more robust to perturbations, and selective training to preserve the useful knowledge in pre-trained models. The effectiveness of RoAST is evaluated on sentiment classification and entailment tasks by measuring performance on multiple robustness metrics.

So in summary, the key terms cover language model fine-tuning, model robustness, adversarial training, selective model updating, and multi-perspective evaluation of robustness.
