# [MaskViT: Masked Visual Pre-Training for Video Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11894)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses that this paper tries to address are:

1. Can we create good video prediction models by pre-training transformers via masked visual modeling, without a lot of domain-specific engineering?

2. Can the proposed model Masked ViT (MaskViT) achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance on standard video prediction benchmarks, compared to prior work? 

3. Can MaskViT generate high resolution future frame predictions efficiently, unlike prior transformer-based video prediction models?

4. Can the iterative decoding scheme proposed enable significantly faster inference compared to autoregressive decoding, making the model suitable for robotics applications?

5. Does masking a variable percentage of tokens during pre-training, instead of a fixed ratio, better mimic the video prediction task and lead to improved performance?

6. Can the proposed spatial and spatiotemporal windowed attention provide memory and computational benefits over full attention transformers?

7. Can the model predictions be used to successfully perform visual model predictive control on a real robot?

In summary, the key hypotheses are around showing that masked visual pre-training can produce high-performing and efficient video prediction models suitable for robotics, using only minimal domain knowledge. The design choices like variable masking ratio, windowed attention, and iterative decoding are meant to test these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing Masked Video Transformer (MaskViT), a video prediction model based on masked visual modeling and iterative decoding. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing to pre-train a Transformer for video prediction via masked visual modeling (MVM), where a variable percentage of future frame tokens are masked and predicted based on past frames. This is inspired by masked language modeling in BERT.

- Using a combination of spatial and spatiotemporal window-restricted attention in the Transformer layers for memory and computation efficiency when operating on sequences of video frames.

- An iterative decoding procedure during inference where tokens are predicted sequentially over multiple iterations while decreasing the mask ratio. This non-autoregressive technique bridges the gap between pre-training and test-time prediction and speeds up inference significantly.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive results on multiple video prediction benchmarks like BAIR, KITTI, and Robonet, while being more parameter efficient. The model can also generate higher resolution videos than prior work.

- Showing real-time robot manipulation planning using MaskViT, enabled by the fast iterative decoding. This suggests the general framework could enable using powerful predictive models for robotics and other embodied AI applications.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a simple yet effective masked Transformer model for video prediction via innovations in pre-training, architecture design, and inference procedure. The strong results and real robot experiments highlight the potential of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MaskViT, a video prediction model based on masked visual pre-training of transformers with windowed attention, which achieves state-of-the-art results while being computationally efficient enough for robot planning through iterative decoding.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points on how this paper compares to other research in the field of video prediction:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing Masked Video Transformer (MaskViT), a video prediction model based on masked visual modeling and transformer networks with windowed attention. This approach builds on recent advances in self-supervised representation learning like BERT in NLP and MAE/BEiT in vision.

- Most prior video prediction works use specialized model architectures like convolutional LSTM/GRU, causal convolutions, or 3D convolutions. This paper shows that a general-purpose architecture like the transformer can achieve strong results when combined with the right pre-training objective (masked modeling) and modifications (windowed attention).

- Many recent video prediction models are based on VAEs or GANs. This work follows a simple discrete VAE (VQ-VAE) to tokenization frames, and then uses a bidirectional transformer on the discrete tokens. The results demonstrate this is a viable alternative to other common generative modeling frameworks.

- A key difference from autoregressive models like VideoGPT is the iterative decoding procedure during inference. This non-autoregressive generation is much faster, enabling the use of MaskViT for model-based control on a real robot.

- The variable masking ratio at training time and mask scheduling at test time help reduce the discrepancy between pre-training and evaluation that is often a challenge for masked autoencoders.

- The model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive quantitative results on multiple datasets while using relatively few parameters. It also demonstrates video prediction at higher resolutions than previous works.

- Limitations include the use of per-frame rather than video compression in the VQ-VAE which can cause flicker artifacts, and difficulty scaling to very long videos. The robotic experiments are also quite simple manipulation tasks.

In summary, this work explores an alternative approach to video prediction based on recent ideas from representation learning and shows promising results, while highlighting some limitations and areas for further work. The simple and general methodology could potentially apply to other sequence modeling tasks as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Scaling up video prediction to more complex scenarios with significant camera motion, such as videos from self-driving cars or egocentric videos. The current method has been demonstrated on relatively simple datasets with mostly static backgrounds.

- Increasing the complexity of robotic tasks that can be solved via planning with the video prediction model. The real robot experiments in the paper focus on simple pushing tasks. Extending this to more intricate manipulation skills would be an important next step.

- Addressing the issue of flicker artifacts that can arise from using per-frame latent representations, especially for videos with static backgrounds. Exploring spatiotemporal compression rather than per-frame could help.

- Leveraging recent advances in representation learning via self-supervised methods to help improve video prediction performance further. The authors mention this as a promising direction for future improvement.

- Scaling up the model size and using much larger video datasets for pretraining, as has been done in language and image domains.

- Integrating the video prediction model with more complex planning and control algorithms beyond the simple cross-entropy method used in the paper.

So in summary, the main directions mentioned are scaling up the dataset size, model complexity, task complexity, and integration with more advanced planning and control methods to tackle even harder embodied AI challenges. The flicker artifact issue is also noted as something to address in future work.
