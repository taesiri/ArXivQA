# [Modeling Boundedly Rational Agents with Latent Inference Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04030)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new model called the Latent Inference Budget Model (L-IBM) for modeling boundedly rational agents. Rather than adding noise to optimal decisions, L-IBMs explicitly model agents' computational constraints by inferring a latent variable that controls the runtime of an anytime inference algorithm used by the agent. L-IBMs can be applied to diverse tasks with anytime algorithms like truncated search, RSA models of pragmatic language, and Monte Carlo tree search. Experiments across navigation, language understanding, and chess gameplay tasks demonstrate that L-IBMs match or exceed standard Boltzmann models of bounded rationality in predicting human actions. Moreover, the inferred budgets correlate with intuitive measures of task difficulty and agent skill. By transparently modeling the algorithms behind suboptimal behavior, L-IBMs enable learning from diverse populations and yield informative measures of population heterogeneity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a latent inference budget model (L-IBM) that explicitly models agents' computational constraints by inferring the runtime of an anytime approximate inference algorithm, outperforming standard Boltzmann models of bounded rationality on tasks like maze navigation, pragmatic language understanding, and predicting human gameplay in chess.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a latent inference budget model (L-IBM) that can explicitly model agents' computational constraints by inferring a latent variable that controls the runtime of an anytime inference algorithm used by the agent. Specifically:

- They introduce a modeling framework where agents select actions based on an anytime inference algorithm with a computational budget parameter. This budget controls the runtime/iterations of the inference procedure rather than directly controlling noise or suboptimality.

- They show this framework allows efficiently learning agent models by marginalizing over latent budget variables. Crucially, if the inference algorithm is anytime, computing marginalization over different budget values is efficient.

- They demonstrate their L-IBM framework in three diverse domains - maze navigation, pragmatic language understanding, and human chess play. In all three, the L-IBM matches or outperforms standard Boltzmann models of bounded rationality.

- The inferred latent budgets themselves provide meaningful information about agent subpopulations, correlating with measures of skill, partner skill, and task difficulty in the experiments.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an interpretable and efficient modeling approach for bounded rationality by focusing on computational constraints, enabled by introducing and marginalizing over a latent budget variable with anytime algorithms.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Bounded rationality - The paper studies modeling agents pursuing goals subject to computational constraints, rather than assuming optimal decision-making.

- Latent inference budgets - A key idea in the paper is explicitly modeling agents' computational limitations via a latent variable controlling the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm.

- Anytime algorithms - The approach is applicable to anytime algorithms that can be stopped at any point and still return an approximate solution.

- Three domains - The approach is tested on three diverse domains: maze navigation, pragmatic language understanding, and predicting moves in human chess games.

- Boltzmann models - The proposed latent inference budget models are compared to standard Boltzmann models of noisy rational decision-making.

- Subpopulation modeling - The method can learn models of diverse agent populations with differing computational constraints.

- Inference budget correlates - Inferred budgets correlate with intuitive measures of task difficulty and agent skill in the experiments.

So in summary, key terms cover concepts like bounded rationality, computational budgets, anytime algorithms, goal inference, pragmatic language, and modeling agent populations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the Latent Inference Budget Model (L-IBM) explicitly model the computational constraints or "inference budgets" of agents, and why is this useful compared to standard models of bounded rationality?

2) What are "anytime algorithms" and how do they make optimization of the L-IBM objective (Eq 1) tractable? Provide an example of converting a standard algorithm into an anytime algorithm.  

3) In the maze navigation experiments, the L-IBM outperforms Boltzmann models in predicting actions. What explanations are provided for this performance difference? How do the inferred parameters differ between L-IBM and Boltzmann models?

4) For the Colors in Context experiments, what are two benefits provided by using L-IBM to model speakers over just using a fixed parameterization of RSA? How does L-IBM allow you to uncover individual differences?

5) Explain in detail how Rational Speech Acts (RSA) satisfies the criteria of being an anytime algorithm, and how the depth budget controls recursive reasoning between the speaker and listener. 

6) In the Chess experiments, describe how Monte Carlo Tree Search is formulated as an anytime algorithm where the depth budget controls the number of node expansions. What about the PUCT exploration parameter?

7) Why can't a standard Boltzmann formulation account for differences in search complexity when comparing the maze trajectories in Figure 1? Give a specific example.

8) What is the generative process assumed to produce the collection of observed trajectories under the L-IBM formulation? 

9) The objective function (Eq 1) requires reasoning about all possible depth budgets. Explain how the use of anytime algorithms allows efficient optimization.

10) What types of real-world data would be suitable to model with L-IBM? What properties should the agents' planning algorithms have to apply this method?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of modeling a population of agents pursuing unknown goals subject to unknown computational constraints. Standard models of bounded rationality typically add noise to optimal decisions to simulate suboptimal behavior. However, this approach fails to explicitly model the agents' computational limitations and inferential procedures. It also cannot account for non-homogenous suboptimality across a diverse population of agents.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Latent Inference Budget Model (L-IBM) that explicitly models agents' computational budgets. It introduces a latent variable that controls the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm used by the agent. By modeling suboptimal decision-making as truncated search, L-IBMs can capture differences in inference procedures and non-uniform bounded rationality. 

The key idea is that many approximate inference algorithms are "anytime algorithms", meaning their solutions improve gradually with more computation time. By parameterizing the inference budget, the runtime directly controls the solution quality. Crucially, evaluating the model for multiple budget values is efficient for anytime algorithms.

The training process involves jointly inferring the agents' reward functions and computational budget distributions to best explain the observed behavior across a population.


Main Contributions:

- Proposes L-IBM, a general framework to model bounded rationality by inferring latent inference budgets of agents

- Shows L-IBM can be applied to anytime algorithms like truncated search, Monte Carlo tree search, RSA pragmatic reasoning 

- Demonstrates L-IBM matches or outperforms standard Boltzmann models of bounded optimality on navigation, language pragmatics and chess gameplay

- Provides an efficient way to compute distributions over computational budgets

- Inferred budgets correlate with intuitive measures of task difficulty, player skill etc.

So in summary, the key idea is to model suboptimal decision-making by parameterizing the runtime of inference algorithms, instead of simply injecting noise. This provides a general, efficient and interpretable approach to capture diversity in bounded rationality.
