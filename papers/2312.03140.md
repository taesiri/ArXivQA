# [FlexModel: A Framework for Interpretability of Distributed Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03140)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the rise of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters, the hardware requirements for training and running these models have increased substantially. While existing tools help with model parallelization and distributed training, deeper interactions with the models' internals for purposes like interpretability and responsible AI still require extensive knowledge of distributed computing. This poses a barrier for researchers with ML expertise but limited systems background. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents FlexModel, a software package that provides a lightweight and easy-to-use interface for interacting with large models distributed across multi-GPU/multi-node setups. FlexModel wraps PyTorch models deployed using libraries like Accelerate, FSDP, DeepSpeed, etc. and allows user-defined HookFunctions to enable straightforward interaction with distributed model internals during forward and backward passes.

Key Contributions:

- FlexModel API: Provides infrastructure-agnostic model interface to lower barriers for interpretability/responsible AI research at scale without needing deep understanding of distributed systems. Aligns distributed model interaction paradigm with simpler single-device manipulation.

- HookFunctions: User-defined modules to retrieve/edit activations. Handle communication to materialize full activation tensors. Allow arbitrary code to run on activations in a single-threaded manner.

- Experiments: Validates FlexModel's utility through Transformer Induction Head Isolation on 70B-parameter LLaMA model and implementation of TunedLens method.

In summary, FlexModel democratizes interactions with large distributed models to promote more inclusive research in large neural networks. The package is available at https://github.com/VectorInstitute/flex_model.
