# [ADVENT: Attack/Anomaly Detection in VANETs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are vulnerable to attacks like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) due to their dynamic nature and varying network topologies. This can compromise critical safety information exchanged between vehicles.  
- Existing intrusion detection systems have limitations in simultaneously detecting attack onsets and identifying malicious nodes in real-time while preserving privacy.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multi-layered real-time system called ADVENT for attack/anomaly detection in VANETs. 
- It uses a combination of machine learning (ML) and statistical techniques for effective and efficient attack onset detection and malicious node identification. 
- ADVENT implements federated learning (FL) to enhance privacy while improving efficiency and reducing false negatives.
- A novel data preprocessing method is introduced that generates features capturing packet reception over time, enabling understanding of communication patterns.
- Synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) is used to address class imbalance.

Key Contributions:
1) A 3-tier system for real-time attack onset detection and malicious node identification
2) Privacy-enhanced federated learning implementation to leverage collective experience and reduce false negatives
3) Innovative feature selection combining domain knowledge and feature engineering for efficiency
4) Realistic VANET simulations across diverse urban scenarios to ensure reliability of datasets/results  
5) Identification of a threshold and SMOTE implementation to effectively mitigate impact of imbalanced data

The system achieves excellent performance, detecting 99.66% of attacks onsets in the first second and identifying malicious nodes with 97.85% F1-score on average. Privacy is also improved via federated learning while significantly reducing the false negative rate compared to prior art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Designing and developing a comprehensive three-tier real-time system called ADVENT that effectively detects the onset of DDoS attacks and identifies the responsible malicious nodes in vehicular networks.
