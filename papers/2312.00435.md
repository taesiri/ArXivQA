# [Enhancing Image Captioning with Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00435)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores neural image captioning using various neural network architectures on the Yelp image dataset. The authors compare "inject" and "merge" model architectures, finding that the inject model generates the most relevant and concise image captions. They also propose a beam search inference procedure with a custom scoring function to balance caption length and relevance. Through quantitative analysis using BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitative analysis of generated captions, the authors demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of different model configurations. Key challenges highlighted include overfitting, the complexity of real-world data, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning. While results are promising, the paper emphasizes the need for further refinement of training data and methodology to build a robust image captioning system. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into designing and evaluating neural captioning models, motivating further research to advance the state-of-the-art.
