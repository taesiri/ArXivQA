# [Responsibility in Extensive Form Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07637)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Two forms of responsibility have been studied - counterfactual responsibility (could an agent have prevented something) and seeing-to-it responsibility (did an agent guarantee something). These have been studied in settings where agents act simultaneously.
- Extending these notions to settings where agents act sequentially (extensive form games) is non-trivial. Existing attempts to extend seeing-to-it responsibility have limitations. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new notion of seeing-to-it responsibility for extensive form games that combines existing ideas of "strategically seeing to it" and "achievement seeing to it". 
- An agent sees to a statement backwards-strategically if they have the ability to guarantee it from the start and maintain this ability throughout. An agent sees to a statement in the achievement way if they eliminate the last possibility for it to be false.
- The proposed notion of responsibility requires an agent to see to a statement both backwards-strategically and in the achievement way. This captures both the ability and action to guarantee something.

Technical Contributions:
- Proof that the new seeing-to-it responsibility notion and counterfactual responsibility are not definable from each other, requiring both in the logical language.
- Formalization and analysis of higher-order responsibility concepts that are important for real applications.   
- Formal analysis of responsibility gaps - situations where no agent is responsible for something, including hierarchies of higher-order responsibility gaps.
- Result showing higher-order responsibility gaps do not exist from a certain order upwards in extensive form games.
- Analysis of complexity of model checking for the logics proposed.

Overall the paper makes important conceptual and technical contributions to the understanding of responsibility in multiagent sequential decision settings that commonly occur in practice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new notion of responsibility for seeing to it in extensive form games that overcomes limitations with existing approaches, proves it is undefinable via counterfactual responsibility, formally defines higher-order and gaps in responsibility attribution, and shows higher-order gaps do not exist if the order is high enough.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes a new notion of "seeing-to-it" responsibility that is suitable for modeling responsibility in extensive form games. This notion combines elements of "backwards-strategically seeing-to-it" and "achievement seeing-to-it" to better capture the intuitions behind responsibility in these settings.

2. It formally defines and studies two key forms of responsibility that have been discussed in the literature - counterfactual responsibility and the proposed seeing-to-it responsibility. It shows these modalities are mutually undefinable, demonstrating they capture distinct concepts. 

3. It formally defines and analyzes the concept of a "responsibility gap" - situations where no agent can be ascribed responsibility. It shows that for 2-agent extensive form games, there are no responsibility gaps under the notions studied. However, gaps can occur with 3 or more agents.  

4. It introduces a hierarchy of higher-order responsibility gaps and shows that for sufficiently high orders, responsibility gaps cease to occur, even in multiagent settings. This demonstrates the importance of considering higher-order attribution of responsibility.

In summary, the paper makes both conceptual contributions in formalizing new varieties of responsibility for extensive form games, as well as technical contributions in studying relationships between different types of responsibility attribution and the conditions under which responsibility gaps can occur.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Responsibility
- Counterfactual responsibility 
- Seeing-to-it responsibility
- Extensive form games
- Multiagent systems
- Higher-order responsibility
- Responsibility gap
- Undefinability results
- Model checking complexity

The paper discusses two main forms of responsibility (counterfactual and seeing-to-it) in the context of extensive form games played by multiple agents. It proposes a new definition of seeing-to-it responsibility suitable for this setting. The paper proves undefinability results showing these two forms of responsibility cannot be defined using only the other. It introduces higher-order responsibility and analyzes the complexity of model checking. A key concept studied is the responsibility gap, where no agent can be ascribed responsibility. Different levels of responsibility gaps are defined and analyzed.

In summary, the key terms cover the two types of responsibility, the game setting, logical concepts like undefinability and model checking complexity, and ideas around gaps in ascribing responsibility.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a new notion of "seeing-to-it" responsibility that combines aspects of both strategically seeing-to-it and achievement seeing-to-it. What is the intuition behind this combination and why is it argued to better capture the concept of responsibility than either existing notion on its own?

2) The paper shows that counterfactual responsibility and the proposed "seeing-to-it" responsibility are mutually undefinable in extensive form games. What does this result imply about the relationship between these two types of responsibility? Why can they not substitute for one another? 

3) Higher-order responsibility is discussed in the paper, referring to nested modalities like an agent being responsible for another agent's responsibility. What interesting properties related to higher-order responsibility are identified? What do they imply about multi-agent settings?

4) What is the complexity, in terms of time, of computing/model checking the truth set for the proposed modalities of counterfactual and seeing-to-it responsibility? Walk through the algorithms and analysis that support the complexity result. 

5) Formally define what is meant by a "responsibility gap" in extensive form games. What hierarchy of responsibility gaps is introduced and why is it argued to be an important concept when designing accountability mechanisms?

6) Explain, in detail, the formal proof showing that the responsibility gap does not exist at higher orders for any extensive form game. What key lemmas are leveraged? Why was showing this an important result?

7) For games with only two agents, explain why the paper proves there cannot exist responsibility gaps. Intuitively, why does this make sense?

8) Provide a specific example extensive form game with more than two agents where a first-order responsibility gap does exist. Explain step-by-step why the gap occurs.  

9) Discuss the paper's approach to proving the mutual undefinability results, using "truth set algebra", and contrast it with the more traditional bisimulation method. What are the tradeoffs?

10) How well does the proposed approach extend to extensive form games with imperfect information? What new challenges arise in that setting that would need to be addressed?
