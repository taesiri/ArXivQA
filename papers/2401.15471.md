# [ConvoSense: Overcoming Monotonous Commonsense Inferences for   Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15471)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing commonsense datasets for dialogues lack depth and novelty in their inferences. They often just restate information already present in the dialogues or make trivial inferences. 
- Current datasets also fail to capture the multifaceted nature of commonsense reasoning by only providing a single inference per dialogue context.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors compile a new large-scale commonsense dataset for dialogues called ConvoSense using GPT-3. 
- ConvoSense contains over 500,000 commonsense inferences across 12,000 dialogues and 10 inference types.
- The inferences have greater contextual novelty, offer more detail, and provide multiple diverse inferences per dialogue context compared to previous datasets.

Main Contributions:
- ConvoSense dataset with over 500,000 commonsense inferences across 10 types showing greater novelty and detail than human-generated datasets.
- Analysis of GPT's ability to generate high quality and diverse commonsense inferences.
- Exploration of different strategies to train generative models on ConvoSense that can produce multiple detailed and reasonable inferences per context.
- Experiments showing models trained on ConvoSense generate inferences with higher reasonability, novelty and detail compared to models trained on human-generated datasets.

In summary, the authors create a large-scale and diverse commonsense dataset for dialogues using GPT-3 which allows training improved commonsense inference models that generate more detailed, reasonable and novel inferences compared to existing datasets and models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents ConvoSense, a large-scale dataset of commonsense inferences for dialogue contexts generated by GPT that provides more detailed, novel, and reasonable inferences across more types and examples than prior datasets, and shows that models trained on it outperform models trained on human-generated datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new synthetic dataset called ConvoSense for commonsense reasoning in dialogue contexts. Specifically:

- ConvoSense contains over 500,000 commonsense inferences across 12,000 dialogues and covers 10 popular inference types. It was automatically constructed using the GPT language model.

- Compared to existing human-generated datasets, ConvoSense has greater contextual novelty, inference diversity and detail, while maintaining high reasonability.

- The paper shows that models trained on ConvoSense generate inferences that are more plausible, detailed and novel compared to models trained on previous datasets.

- To the best of the authors' knowledge, ConvoSense is the first dialogue-based commonsense dataset to provide such a large volume and variety of novel inferences tailored to dialogue contexts.

So in summary, the key contribution is the new ConvoSense dataset that advances commonsense resources for dialogue and enables improved commonsense inference models to be trained. The trained ConvoSense models outperform models built on previous datasets.
