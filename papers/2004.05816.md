# Will I Sound Like Me? Improving Persona Consistency in Dialogues through   Pragmatic Self-Consciousness

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:How can dialogue agents be improved to generate more consistent persona-based responses, without requiring additional labeled data or training? The key hypothesis is that endowing dialogue agents with a sense of "public self-consciousness" through modeling an imaginary listener will make them more sensitive to potential inconsistencies and help them generate more persona-consistent responses. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:1) Modeling an imaginary listener within a Rational Speech Acts framework will let dialogue agents simulate how their utterances are perceived, making them more self-conscious about sounding consistent with their persona. 2) Updating the world prior using the listener helps preserve useful contextual information over time.3) Learning to select distractors, rather than random selection, results in more useful negative examples for the listener to compare against the speaker's persona.4) Overall, this approach of adding public self-consciousness will improve persona consistency for existing dialogue agents without needing additional training data or modules, and is generalizable beyond just persona to dialogue context consistency.The paper aims to test these hypotheses through quantitative evaluations on dialogue datasets as well as human evaluations. The key novelty is the idea of using principles from pragmatics and social cognition to improve consistency in neural dialogue agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing an approach to improve persona consistency in dialog systems without needing additional labeled data or models. Specifically, the key ideas are:1. Endowing dialog agents with "public self-consciousness" by having them model an imaginary listener. This helps the agent generate utterances that sound consistent with its persona to the listener.2. Extending the Rational Speech Acts framework with two new features: (a) A method to learn selection of distractors (alternate personas), rather than manual/random selection. This uses a memory network to retrieve useful distractors.(b) A different update for the listener's prior that better preserves information from previous states. 3. Showing that this approach can improve consistency of existing persona-based dialog models like TransferTransfo, Blender etc. on the Dialogue NLI and PersonaChat datasets, without needing extra labeled data.4. Demonstrating that the approach can also improve context consistency beyond just persona consistency in dialogs.So in summary, the main novelty seems to be using ideas from pragmatics/social cognition to improve dialog consistency, with technical contributions around extending the Rational Speech Acts framework and showing consistent improvement across models and datasets. The self-consciousness modeling and not needing extra supervision appear to be the key benefits.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes an approach to improve the consistency of dialogue agents by endowing them with public self-consciousness modeled through an imaginary listener in the Rational Speech Acts framework, without needing additional labeled data or training.
