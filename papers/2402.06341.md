# [RareBench: Can LLMs Serve as Rare Diseases Specialists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06341)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Rare diseases affect about 300 million people globally, but have very low diagnosis rates due to lack of expertise and complexities in differentiating between numerous rare diseases.  
- Recent examples like "ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a 4-year old's rare disease after 17 doctors failed" highlight the potential of large language models (LLMs) in rare disease diagnosis, but this area is currently underexplored.

Proposed Solution - RareBench Benchmark:
- Introduces RareBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 4 key tasks to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in rare disease diagnosis:
   1) Phenotype extraction from electronic health records (EHRs)
   2) Screening for specific rare diseases  
   3) Comparative analysis of common and rare diseases
   4) Differential diagnosis among a universal set of rare diseases
- Compiles the largest open dataset of 1,650 rare disease patient cases from public sources and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) across 421 diseases
- Develops a dynamic few-shot prompting strategy that significantly boosts diagnostic performance by retrieving most relevant cases using a comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph 

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark (RareBench) to systematically assess LLMs as rare disease specialists
- Largest open dataset of rare disease patients established as a valuable benchmark
- Knowledge graph-based dynamic prompting technique that enhances LLM performance in rare disease diagnosis
- Experiments show GPT-4 has diagnostic capabilities on par with senior doctors across five specialties in differential diagnosis of rare diseases

In summary, this paper introduces RareBench to benchmark LLMs in rare disease diagnosis, uses innovative prompting strategies to boost performance, and shows GPT-4 matching expert physician capabilities, paving the way for advancing LLMs in this complex domain.
