# [Understanding Representations Pretrained with Auxiliary Losses for   Embodied Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained visual representations from large models have improved embodied policy learning, but don't provide effective support for agent planning out-of-the-box. 
- It's unclear if additional self-supervised pretraining on exploration trajectories can build on these visual representations to better support planning in realistic environments.

Methods:
- Evaluate 4 common auxiliary losses (temporal distance, inverse/forward dynamics, contrastive predictive coding) and 2 hindsight-based losses for pretraining the agent's visual and belief representations. 
- Use CLIP as the visual backbone, pretrain on exploration trajectories from ProcTHOR houses.
- Freeze pretrained modules and evaluate on multi-step imitation learning for object goal navigation and a new "leave and return" navigation task.

Results: 
- Surprisingly, imitation learning outperforms all other auxiliary losses despite different pretraining/evaluation distributions. This suggests imitation of exploration may be an effective approach for planning representations.
- Popular auxiliary losses can benefit from simple modifications to improve downstream planning ability.
- All pretraining objectives outperform "blind" statistical baselines.

Conclusions:
- Imitation learning is a strong baseline for this pipeline, potentially due to richness of behavior in pretraining trajectories. Data quality seems very important.
- While auxiliary losses were not the most effective for evaluation here, they could still be useful when combined with reinforcement learning.
- Future work includes evaluating on embodied policy learning, adding more evaluation tasks, and exploring metrics that capture planning ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates how different auxiliary pretraining objectives on exploration trajectories, paired with a frozen CLIP visual backbone, impact the effectiveness of learned agent representations to support multi-step planning on downstream embodied tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper systematically compares different self-supervised pretraining objectives on exploration trajectories and evaluates how the resulting learned representations transfer to downstream embodied tasks requiring multi-step planning. Specifically, it compares four common auxiliary losses in embodied AI (e.g. inverse dynamics), two new hindsight-based losses, and imitation learning. It pretrains both a visual module and a belief module on exploration trajectories using these losses. The key findings are:

(1) Imitation learning on exploration trajectories surprisingly outperforms the other more complex losses in enabling effective transfer to downstream tasks, despite the exploration trajectories being quite different from the goal-directed downstream tasks. This suggests imitation paired with high-quality pretraining data may be an extremely effective approach.

(2) Simple variants of standard auxiliary losses (e.g. using belief states directly) transfer better than original formulations.

(3) The results highlight the importance of high-quality pretraining datasets, in addition to the pretraining objective, for learning reusable representations.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic study disentangling the effects of different self-supervised objectives and datasets on representation learning for embodied planning. The paper introduces an evaluation methodology and initial findings in this direction.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it include:

- Goal-directed navigation
- Imitation learning
- Hindsight experience replay
- Inverse dynamics prediction

The paper examines how different self-supervised pretraining objectives and auxiliary losses can be used to learn visual and state representations for embodied AI agents, using exploration trajectories. It then evaluates the transferred usefulness of these representations on downstream goal-directed navigation tasks through multi-step imitation learning. Some of the key pretraining objectives studied include imitation learning, inverse dynamics, hindsight experience replay variants, and contrastive predictive coding. The aim is to understand what type of pretraining leads to more generally useful representations for planning in embodied agents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares auxiliary pretraining objectives on a fixed dataset of exploration trajectories. How might the conclusions change if pretraining was done on random (non-expert) trajectories instead? What role does trajectory quality play in determining downstream task performance?

2. The paper surprisingly found that imitation learning outperformed other more complex losses like hindsight and inverse dynamics, despite their better pretraining performance. Why might this be the case? Does it imply imitation is sufficient if trajectories are rich enough?

3. The paper adapts a prior architecture from Khandelwal et al. 2022. What modifications were made and why? How crucial is the choice of architecture to assessing the impact of different pretraining objectives?

4. The paper uses CLIP features as a fixed visual backbone. How might conclusions change with a different backbone like DINO or R3M? Is the relative comparison of pretraining objectives likely to hold across backbones?

5. The paper compares auxiliary losses to simple variants, finding improved downstream performance. Why do these variants work better? What does this imply about designing auxiliary losses for representation learning?

6. The paper uses a 3-step imitation learning evaluation. Why was multi-step evaluation chosen over single-step? What are the limitations of an imitation learning evaluation for assessing planning representations?  

7. Both visual and state representations are pretrained jointly. What is the motivation for pretraining the state representation? How does this impact conclusions versus just pretraining the visual encoder?

8. Two hindsight-based pretraining objectives are proposed. Why do these fail to outperform imitation learning despite better pretraining performance? When might they be more useful?

9. The paper uses goal-conditioned navigation tasks for evaluation. How sensitive are conclusions to the choice of downstream tasks? What other tasks could reveal different strengths/weaknesses of learned representations?

10. The paper aims to compare pretraining objectives, not achieve SOTA performance. How might conclusions change if representations were optimized to maximize downstream performance rather than kept fixed? What are the tradeoffs?
