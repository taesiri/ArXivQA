# [Understanding Representations Pretrained with Auxiliary Losses for   Embodied Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained visual representations from large models have improved embodied policy learning, but don't provide effective support for agent planning out-of-the-box. 
- It's unclear if additional self-supervised pretraining on exploration trajectories can build on these visual representations to better support planning in realistic environments.

Methods:
- Evaluate 4 common auxiliary losses (temporal distance, inverse/forward dynamics, contrastive predictive coding) and 2 hindsight-based losses for pretraining the agent's visual and belief representations. 
- Use CLIP as the visual backbone, pretrain on exploration trajectories from ProcTHOR houses.
- Freeze pretrained modules and evaluate on multi-step imitation learning for object goal navigation and a new "leave and return" navigation task.

Results: 
- Surprisingly, imitation learning outperforms all other auxiliary losses despite different pretraining/evaluation distributions. This suggests imitation of exploration may be an effective approach for planning representations.
- Popular auxiliary losses can benefit from simple modifications to improve downstream planning ability.
- All pretraining objectives outperform "blind" statistical baselines.

Conclusions:
- Imitation learning is a strong baseline for this pipeline, potentially due to richness of behavior in pretraining trajectories. Data quality seems very important.
- While auxiliary losses were not the most effective for evaluation here, they could still be useful when combined with reinforcement learning.
- Future work includes evaluating on embodied policy learning, adding more evaluation tasks, and exploring metrics that capture planning ability.
