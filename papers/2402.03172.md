# [Accurate and Well-Calibrated ICD Code Assignment Through Attention Over   Diverse Label Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manually assigning ICD codes to clinical text is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive. Hence, there is a need for accurate automated approaches.  
- However, automatic ICD coding remains challenging due to: (1) long clinical narratives, (2) specialized medical vocabulary, (3) high-dimensional and sparse label space, and (4) imbalanced classes.
- In addition to classification, estimating code prevalence (quantification) is also important for downstream tasks, requiring well-calibrated models.

Proposed Solution:
- Uses a Transformer-based text encoder (GatorTron) to handle lengthy clinical documents through either a Longformer or splitting text into chunks.
- Employs a multi-synonyms attention mechanism that leverages diverse ICD code synonyms from medical ontologies to enhance representation learning.  
- Performs joint training of classification and quantification objectives to improve model calibration while informing downstream quantification tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a new state-of-the-art deep learning method for automated ICD coding that outperforms previous models on MIMIC-III benchmark datasets.
- Multi-synonyms attention mechanism significantly boosts coding performance by exploiting code descriptions and synonyms.
- Joint training enhances model calibration, leading to accurate quantification estimates that outperform standard methods.
- Provides comprehensive analyses highlighting capabilities in classifying various disease types and chapters, along with effectiveness in few-shot learning.
- Establishes new benchmarks for ICD coding on two standardized MIMIC-III dataset splits.

In summary, the paper puts forth a novel approach advancing the state-of-the-art in automated ICD coding through an effective text encoder, multi-synonyms labeling mechanism and joint classification-quantification training.
