# [MDQE: Mining Discriminative Query Embeddings to Segment Occluded   Instances on Challenging Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14395)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper tries to address is:

How to improve video instance segmentation performance on challenging videos with occluded objects and crowded scenes? 

The key hypothesis is that mining discriminative query embeddings can help distinguish occluded instances in such challenging videos, leading to better segmentation performance compared to prior arts.

Specifically, the paper proposes two main ideas:

1. Initialize object queries with spatial-temporal priors by using grid-guided query selection and inter-frame query association. This provides better query embeddings to start with.

2. Use an inter-instance mask repulsion loss during training to force each query to not only match its target instance pixels but also suppress nearby non-target instance pixels. This teaches the model to distinguish between occluded instances.

The main evaluation validates these ideas on the challenging OVIS dataset containing occluded objects. The proposed MDQE method achieves significantly higher performance than prior per-frame and per-clip video instance segmentation methods, especially on occluded objects. This supports the hypothesis that mining discriminative query embeddings helps segment occluded instances.

In summary, the central hypothesis is around improving segmentation of occluded objects by better modeling query embeddings, which is validated through state-of-the-art results on a challenging dataset. The main ideas are query initialization and the proposed inter-instance loss.
