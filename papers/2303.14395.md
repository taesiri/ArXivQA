# [MDQE: Mining Discriminative Query Embeddings to Segment Occluded   Instances on Challenging Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14395)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper tries to address is:

How to improve video instance segmentation performance on challenging videos with occluded objects and crowded scenes? 

The key hypothesis is that mining discriminative query embeddings can help distinguish occluded instances in such challenging videos, leading to better segmentation performance compared to prior arts.

Specifically, the paper proposes two main ideas:

1. Initialize object queries with spatial-temporal priors by using grid-guided query selection and inter-frame query association. This provides better query embeddings to start with.

2. Use an inter-instance mask repulsion loss during training to force each query to not only match its target instance pixels but also suppress nearby non-target instance pixels. This teaches the model to distinguish between occluded instances.

The main evaluation validates these ideas on the challenging OVIS dataset containing occluded objects. The proposed MDQE method achieves significantly higher performance than prior per-frame and per-clip video instance segmentation methods, especially on occluded objects. This supports the hypothesis that mining discriminative query embeddings helps segment occluded instances.

In summary, the central hypothesis is around improving segmentation of occluded objects by better modeling query embeddings, which is validated through state-of-the-art results on a challenging dataset. The main ideas are query initialization and the proposed inter-instance loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a method called MDQE (Mining Discriminative Query Embeddings) to improve video instance segmentation (VIS) on challenging videos with occluded objects and crowded scenes. 

2. Improving the initialization of object queries in VIS by proposing a grid-guided query selection method and inter-frame query association to specify discriminative spatial-temporal priors.

3. Proposing an inter-instance mask repulsion loss to teach the query-based segmenter to distinguish occluded instances by suppressing pixels of nearby non-target instances.

4. Achieving state-of-the-art VIS results on the challenging OVIS dataset using per-clip input, outperforming prior per-frame methods. MDQE achieves 33.0% mask AP on OVIS with ResNet50, which is the best result so far.

5. Obtaining competitive VIS performance on simple videos of YouTube-VIS dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods while using less parameters and faster speed. MDQE achieves 44.5% mask AP on YouTube-VIS 2021.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the MDQE method to effectively segment occluded instances in challenging videos by mining discriminative query embeddings using improved query initialization and inter-instance mask repulsion loss. MDQE sets new state-of-the-art results for per-clip VIS methods on the OVIS dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a video instance segmentation method called MDQE that mines discriminative query embeddings to better segment occluded instances in challenging videos by initializing object queries with spatio-temporal priors and using an inter-instance mask repulsion loss for contrastive learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in video instance segmentation:

- This paper proposes a per-clip input method called MDQE, which focuses on segmenting occluded instances in challenging videos. Most prior work has focused more on per-frame input methods. The per-clip MDQE method is able to exploit richer spatial-temporal features compared to per-frame methods.

- The paper proposes two main novelties to improve per-clip video instance segmentation: (1) initializing object queries with spatial-temporal priors using grid-guided selection and inter-frame association, and (2) an inter-instance mask repulsion loss to distinguish occluded instances. 

- Compared to recent per-clip methods like SeqFormer and VITA that perform temporal aggregation in a naive weighted manner, MDQE better models relationships between instances and incorporates contrastive learning objectives.

- The proposed MDQE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging OVIS dataset with occluded instances, significantly outperforming prior per-clip methods. It also achieves competitive performance on YouTube-VIS.

- On the OVIS dataset, the per-clip MDQE method outperforms recent per-frame methods like IDOL and MinVIS that use contrastive inter-frame instance learning. This suggests the advantages of joint spatio-temporal modeling compared to per-frame approaches.

In summary, this paper pushes state-of-the-art in video instance segmentation for occluded scenes by focusing on mining discriminative query embeddings and modeling inter-instance relationships in a per-clip manner. The novel techniques proposed outperform prior work, especially on challenging datasets with occlusions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust trackers for associating instance masks across long videos, especially those captured with fast camera motion. The paper shows their method struggles a bit on the long videos in the YouTube-VIS 2022 dataset, which contain more complex object motions.

- Further improving the discrimination of instance embeddings and segmentation for occluded objects in crowded scenes. The authors propose some methods for this, but there is still room for improvement on very challenging cases.

- Exploring more sophisticated query initialization strategies that can better encode spatial-temporal priors and instance specific information. The authors propose a simple grid-based method, but more advanced techniques may help.

- Applying the idea of mining discriminative query embeddings to other video understanding tasks like video object detection, multi-object tracking, action recognition etc. The concept could potentially benefit other areas.

- Testing the approach on a broader range of video datasets, especially those with more complex background, severe occlusion, and longer duration. Generalization ability could be improved.

- Reducing the computational requirements to enable real-time performance. The current method is quite fast but real-time would be ideal.

In summary, the key future directions relate to improving robustness, discrimination, and generalization ability of the model, while also reducing the computational demands. Advancing any of these aspects could build nicely on the contributions made in this paper.
