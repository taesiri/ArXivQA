# [Classifying point clouds at the facade-level using geometric features   and deep learning networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06506)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic 3D building models are important for many applications, but automatic interpretation of 3D point clouds to extract detailed semantic information is very challenging. 
- There is a growing need for innovative point cloud classification methods to enable reconstruction of highly detailed (LoD3) 3D building models.
- Few studies have focused on detailed point cloud classification at the facade level using deep learning. Distinguishing facade components like windows or doors is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method to fuse geometric features with deep learning networks like PointNet and PointNet++ to improve point cloud classification performance at the facade level.

- Local geometric features like surface variation, planarity, PCA components and eigenvectors are extracted for each point. These describe the local 3D structure and distribution of neighboring points.

- The features are input together with the point coordinates into the deep learning networks. This provides additional information about local geometry that the networks have difficulty capturing.

Main Contributions:
- Comparison of deep learning and machine learning approaches for facade-level point cloud classification

- A method to improve deep learning network performance by fusing geometric features, achieving 5-10% better accuracy

- Analysis of impact of different geometric feature selections on the networks

- The method can compensate for limitations of deep learning networks in capturing local geometric details, and has potential to advance semantic segmentation for high detail 3D building models.
