# [Assessing Language Model Deployment with Risk Cards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18190)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on a quick skim of the paper, it seems the central goal is to introduce "RiskCards" as a framework for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with deploying language models. The key ideas appear to be:

- Language models can generate harmful or unsafe text. Prior work has identified many potential harms, but existing frameworks like taxonomies, benchmarks, and documentation standards are insufficient for evaluating risks in context. 

- RiskCards provide a way to bridge this gap by allowing for structured, customizable risk assessment tailored to a specific model deployment scenario. 

- RiskCards name and describe specific risks, provide examples, map risks to harm taxonomies, specify required conditions for harm, etc.

- They are designed to be open, participatory, reusable across contexts, and focus on qualitative human evaluation rather than just automated metrics.

- The paper introduces a "starter set" of RiskCards compiled from literature, to demonstrate the concept and kickstart community participation.

So in summary, the central focus seems to be introducing RiskCards as a new framework for contextualized, transparent, and participatory risk assessment and documentation when deploying language models. The overall goal is to enable safer, more responsible LM deployment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework called "Risk Cards" for assessing and documenting the risks associated with deploying language models. Key points:

- Risk Cards provide a structured way to evaluate risks that are specific to a language model's application scenario, going beyond general taxonomies of harms. 

- They aim to be participatory, allowing anyone to contribute new cards. This helps cover emerging risks as models evolve.

- Cards describe risks qualitatively with concrete examples rather than just quantitatively. This captures nuance and avoids over-reliance on imperfect automated assessments.

- Cards detail the risk, evidence of harm, relevant taxonomies, required actions for harm, sample prompts, and notes. This standardized format aids comparison.

- The paper inductively develops an initial set of Risk Cards from surveying prior work on language model harms. These seed an open-source repository for community growth.

- Intended uses include auditors assessing models pre-deployment, model developers releasing cards alongside models, and red teaming exercises.

In summary, Risk Cards provide a flexible, qualitative, risk-centric framework to make language model risks transparent and support safer deployment. The starter card set pools knowledge on known risks to serve as a point of departure.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces the concept of Risk Cards as a tool for structured assessment of risks associated with deploying language models. It makes several key contributions compared to prior related work:

- It focuses specifically on documenting risks rather than evaluating individual models, datasets, or tasks. Risk Cards are designed to be reusable across contexts rather than tied to a specific artifact.

- It emphasizes participatory and qualitative assessment of risks over automated evaluation via benchmarks. The authors argue benchmarks can provide brittle or limited assessments that fail to account for changing contexts. Risk Cards rely more on human judgment and interpretation.

- It aims to create a knowledge base of risks that is open and community-driven, rather than owned by any one organization. Anyone can contribute new Risk Cards or edit existing ones.

- It provides concrete examples of risks and harmful generations in the form of prompt-output pairs. Many previous taxonomies identify risks at a high level without grounding them in examples.

- The standard structure of a Risk Card encourages detailing not just the risk, but required conditions for harm, affected groups, and references. This provides more context compared to high-level taxonomies.

- It is designed to be applied at deployment time to specific models and applications, assessing relevance of risks in context. Other standards like model cards are primarily created at training/release time.

Overall, Risk Cards fill a gap in existing literature by providing a flexible, risk-centric framework for qualitative, collaborative, and context-specific assessment of potential harms from language models. The paper demonstrates the value of this approach through a starter set of Risk Cards derived from literature review.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions, including:

- Developing methods to further improve the performance and robustness of language models, such as through better architectures, training objectives, and regularization techniques. They note that there is still room for improvement on many NLP tasks.

- Improving language models' ability to model complex, hierarchical structure and reasoning. Current models still struggle with some types of complex reasoning and logical inferences. 

- Developing better ways to interpret and analyze language models, in order to better understand their capabilities, limitations, and failure modes. This includes developing better explainability methods.

- Research into more sample-efficient training of language models, to reduce compute and energy costs. Methods like transfer learning, meta-learning, and prompt tuning hold promise here.

- Developing better techniques for controlling and steering language model behavior during inference/generation. This includes developing methods that allow language models to satisfy complex specifications.

- Studying social impacts of language models and how they might be designed to mitigate risks of misuse. For example, looking at issues around bias, fairness, transparency, and misinformation.

- Exploring multimodal models that can process and reason about language jointly with other modalities like vision, audio, etc.

In general, they highlight that language models are a rapidly advancing technology and there remain many open research questions to continue improving them and harnessing them effectively and safely.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces RiskCards, a structured framework for assessing risks associated with deploying language models. RiskCards provide a way to document concrete examples of risks that language models can present, including details on the potential harm, affected groups, required conditions, and sample prompt-output pairs. They allow risks to be mapped to specific models and contexts, building shared knowledge across applications. RiskCards aim to be open-source, dynamic, and qualitative. The authors present a starter set of RiskCards compiled from literature on language model risks and harms. They envision RiskCards being used for auditing, red teaming, and establishing minimum safeguards for deployment. The goal is to raise awareness of failure modes to pave the way for mitigating risks and using language models more safely.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces RiskCards, a framework for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with deploying language models. Language models can generate harmful or dangerous text, but risks depend on the context. Existing tools like benchmarks and model cards are useful but too narrow or broad. RiskCards address this by providing a reusable structure to name, describe, and give evidence for risks in a given language model deployment. 

RiskCards have sections like risk title, description, categorization under risk taxonomies, potential harm types, actions needed for harm, and example risky prompts. They enable pooling knowledge on risks across users and models. The authors present a starter set of RiskCards compiled from literature, to demonstrate the framework and seed further cards. They discuss uses like auditing models or minimum standards before deployment. RiskCards initiate a community knowledge base for understanding and comparing risks to support safer language model use.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called RiskCards for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with deploying language models. RiskCards are designed to name, describe, and provide evidence of risks posed by language models, as well as situate those risks within existing taxonomies. Each RiskCard contains fields specifying the risk title, description, categorization, potential harm types, references demonstrating harm, actions required for harm, sample prompt-output pairs, and additional notes. RiskCards are intended to be open-source, participatory, dynamic, and qualitative. The authors present a starter set of RiskCards compiled from an inductive literature review of language model risks. This starter set is distributed in a public GitHub repository to seed community contributions. Overall, RiskCards aim to increase shared awareness of risks in language model deployment scenarios as a starting point for developing safety protocols and baselines for due diligence.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper introduces "RiskCards", a framework for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with deploying language models. The key problem it aims to address is that current practices for evaluating risks of language models in specific applications are inadequate. 

The paper argues that existing taxonomies of risks are too broad to directly apply to individual assessments. Model cards, data statements and other documentation standards are too narrow, being tied to specific models, datasets or tasks. 

Thus, there is a need for a flexible risk documentation framework that can map general knowledge about language model risks to specific deployment contexts. RiskCards are proposed to fill this gap by providing a standardized way to describe, demonstrate and document risks that arise with language models in context.

Some key features of RiskCards highlighted in the introduction:

- Risk-centric: Focused on naming, delineating and comparing risks rather than models or datasets.

- Participatory: Designed to be open-source and community-driven. 

- Dynamic: New cards can be added as risks emerge. Existing cards can evolve over time.

- Qualitative: Centered on human evaluation rather than solely automated metrics.

In summary, RiskCards aim to provide a shared framework for understanding and mitigating risks across language model deployments. They address the limitations of current practices by taking a flexible, risk-focused approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The TL;DR of the paper is that it proposes "RiskCards" as a structured, open tool for assessing the risks associated with deploying a language model in a specific context. The key idea is that RiskCards provide a way to document and share knowledge about the various risks that language models can present, in order to promote safer and more responsible development and deployment.
