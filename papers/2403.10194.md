# [Ultra-Wideband Positioning System Based on ESP32 and DWM3000 Modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indoor positioning systems often have limitations in accuracy or increased positioning deviation. Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology can enable more precise indoor positioning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a custom UWB positioning system consisting of 6 boards - 1 tag board and 5 anchor boards. It utilizes two-way ranging (TWR) measurements between the tag and anchors to determine distances. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) on the tag board then processes these measurements to estimate the tag's position in real-time, relying on known positions of the anchors.

Key Components:
- ESP32 microcontroller and DWM3000 UWB module on each board for communication and ranging.
- Firmware implements FreeRTOS for multi-tasking capabilities to meet timing requirements.
- EKF leverages a prediction model and measurement model to translate TWR range measurements into position estimates.

Results/Contributions:  
- System achieves localization accuracy up to 10cm in static tests. Position is updated every 250ms.
- Custom hardware design optimized for positioning. Open-source design/code provided.
- Innovative localized processing on the tag board itself, without need for external infrastructure.
- Analysis of impact of anchor positions and multipath conditions on accuracy.
- Overall, presents a precise, low-cost UWB positioning system with the ability to track tags in real-time based on onboard computation.

In summary, the key innovation is the localized position computation on the tag board and the system demonstrates good accuracy. The open-source availability also enables further research and development.
