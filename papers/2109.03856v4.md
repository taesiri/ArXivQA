# [Local Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03856v4)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper focuses on addressing the problem of learning effective node representations for graph neural networks (GNNs) when nodes have few neighbors. The main hypothesis is that the limited number of neighbors for nodes with low degree restricts the expressive power and hinders the performance of GNNs. The paper proposes that generating more features in the local neighborhood via a local augmentation framework can enrich the local information and help the model learn better representations for low-degree nodes. The central research question is: Can a local augmentation framework that generates additional neighborhood features conditioned on the central node improve the performance of GNNs, especially for nodes with few neighbors?


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new data augmentation strategy called "local augmentation" for graph neural networks (GNNs). The key idea is to learn the conditional distribution of the node features of neighbors given the feature of a central node, and sample additional features from this distribution to augment the local neighborhood information. 2. It shows how to decouple the pre-training of the generative model and downstream GNN training, allowing the augmentation model to be applied to any GNN in a plug-and-play manner.3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of this augmentation strategy by applying it to various GNN architectures like GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE etc. across diverse benchmark datasets. Experiments show consistent performance improvements, achieving new state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised node classification tasks.4. Analyses provide insights such as how the approach helps low-degree nodes, is robust to missing node features, and alleviates over-smoothing.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and flexible local augmentation technique to enhance GNN performance by learning to generate additional informative features conditioned on local graph structure and node features. The experimental results across tasks and datasets demonstrate the benefits of this data augmentation approach for GNNs.
