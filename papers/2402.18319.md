# [A Multimodal Handover Failure Detection Dataset and Baselines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Object handovers between robots and humans are prone to failures due to issues like miscommunication, incorrect actions, or unexpected object properties.  
- Existing work focuses on preventing failures during the handover process itself, but not on detecting failures caused by the human after they have occurred.
- There is a lack of datasets and evaluation methods for detecting unpreventable human-induced handover failures.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a new multimodal Handover Failure Detection (HFD) dataset consisting of human-induced failures in both robot-to-human (R2H) and human-to-robot (H2R) handovers.
- The failures are caused by actions of the human participant, such as ignoring the robot, not grasping the object, dropping the object, or not releasing the object. 
- The dataset contains RGB video, robot joint states, and force-torque sensor data.
- The authors also present two baseline methods for failure detection using the dataset:
   1) 3D CNN video classification
   2) Temporal action segmentation of human and robot actions

Main Contributions:
- HFD dataset with human-induced handover failures and multimodal sensor data
- Baseline deep learning methods for handover failure detection showing importance of multimodal inputs
- Analysis of different sensor modalities and loss functions for failure detection
- Human action segmentation to detect failures by identifying unexpected human actions  

The paper introduces an important new dataset to promote research on detecting human-induced failures in human-robot handovers. The baseline methods demonstrate the utility of the multimodal data. Future work includes online failure detection and interpreting failures based on human actions.
