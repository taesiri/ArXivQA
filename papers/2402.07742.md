# [Asking Multimodal Clarifying Questions in Mixed-Initiative   Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In conversational search systems, ambiguous or incomplete queries can lead to irrelevant results. Query clarification is important to resolve ambiguities and capture user intent. 
- Prior work has focused on text-only clarification questions. This paper investigates the novel task of multimodal query clarification (MQC) - using images along with clarifying questions. 

Proposed Solution:
- A new dataset called Melon with over 4k multimodal clarifying questions enriched with 14k images is collected to facilitate MQC research.
- A generative multimodal model named Marto is proposed for MQC. It adopts a prompt-based fine-tuning strategy to perform different subtasks:
   1) Classify if a question needs images or not  
   2) Select the most relevant image for the question
   3) Generate document identifiers for retrieval

Main Contributions:  
- Formulation of the MQC task and creation of the Melon dataset
- Proposal of the Marto model for MQC based on generative modeling and prompt tuning
- Extensive analyses showing images lead to significant improvements in retrieval (up to 90% gain). Multimodal questions also result in more contextualized and informative user responses
- Demonstration that Marto outperforms competitive baselines in efficiency and effectiveness for document retrieval

In summary, this paper formalizes the novel MQC task, provides the Melon dataset to facilitate research, and develops the Marto model to effectively perform MQC for improved document retrieval in conversational search systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new task called "multimodal query clarification (MQC)". Can you explain in more detail what this task involves and how it differs from traditional query clarification? 

2. One of the main hypotheses in the paper is that incorporating images into clarifying questions can improve user engagement and retrieval performance. What evidence or analyses does the paper provide to support this hypothesis?

3. The paper collects a new dataset called Melon to facilitate MQC research. What are some key statistics and features of this dataset? How was it collected and what quality control measures were implemented?

4. The proposed MQC model Marto adopts a multi-task learning approach using prompt-based fine-tuning. Can you explain this approach in more technical detail and why it was chosen over other options? 

5. Marto consists of several modules including multimodal question classification, image selection, and document retrieval. Can you summarize the purpose and implementation of each module? What alternatives were explored?

6. What evaluation metrics were used to assess Marto's performance and how did it compare to various baseline methods? Were statistical significance tests conducted?

7. One research question explored was the impact of different types of images (random, topic-relevant, question-relevant) on retrieval accuracy. What were the key findings? How do you interpret them?

8. The paper argues that generative models like Marto are more effective and efficient than discriminative models for document retrieval. What evidence supports this claim? Can you critically analyze the strengths/limitations?

9. What analysis does the paper provide regarding the effect of multimodal clarifying questions on user responses? Do you think this evidence conclusively demonstrates their value? Why or why not?

10. What limitations exist in the current approach and what future research directions are identified to advance multimodal query clarification? Which direction do you think is most promising and why?
