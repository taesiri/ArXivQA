## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning methods for blind motion deblurring. Blind motion deblurring aims to restore sharp, clear images from blurry inputs without relying on prior knowledge of the blur type or kernel. 

The paper first introduces the problem of motion blur, which can arise from camera shake or object movement. It describes the image degradation model that characterizes blur as a convolution between a sharp image and blur kernel. The paper then explains traditional non-blind deblurring methods, which estimate the blur kernel for deconvolution, and their limitations in handling complex real-world blur.  

As a more effective approach, the paper discusses the emergence of blind deblurring to restore images without assuming knowledge of the underlying blur. It provides an overview of deep learning techniques that have driven advances in blind deblurring, enabled by their ability to learn mappings from big blurry image datasets.

The paper categorizes blind deblurring methods into four types - CNN-based, RNN-based, GAN-based and Transformer-based. It summarizes the architectures and basic principles of methods within each category. The advantages and limitations of different approaches are analyzed. Comparative experimental results on benchmark datasets evaluate the quantitative performance of state-of-the-art techniques. Qualitative examples visually showcase deblurring outcomes.  

Additionally, the paper identifies key challenges that persist, like model generalization, demanding data requirements, balancing efficiency and performance, and supporting high-level vision tasks. It suggests promising future directions, including constructing comprehensive datasets, innovating network architectures, developing better evaluation metrics, exploring few-shot learning and applying diffusion models.

In conclusion, this exhaustive review synthesizes recent progress in deep learning for blind motion deblurring. It provides researchers and practitioners an invaluable reference covering datasets, metrics, methods and performance comparisons toward advancing this dynamic field.
