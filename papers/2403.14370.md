# [SyncTweedies: A General Generative Framework Based on Synchronized   Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to expand the capabilities of pretrained image diffusion models to produce diverse 2D and 3D visual content, including panoramic images and textures for 3D objects, without needing to train diffusion models from scratch for each specific type of visual content. Collecting large-scale training data for each type of visual content is infeasible. However, most visual content can be converted to regular images through certain mappings. Thus, the paper explores utilizing such bridging functions along with pretrained image diffusion models to generate various visual content.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a framework that generates data points in a desired "canonical" visual content space by combining multiple denoising processes from pretrained image diffusion models defined on "instance" spaces. Bridging functions connect the canonical space and instance spaces through projection and unprojection operations. The paper investigates synchronizing multiple diffusion processes through:
1) Performing individual denoising in instance spaces and aggregating using the bridging functions 
2) Denoising directly in the canonical space using redirected noise prediction from instance spaces

Five main joint diffusion cases are analyzed by varying the timing of output aggregation. A previously unexplored case is revealed - averaging the outputs of Tweedie's formula while conducting denoising in instance spaces - referred to as "SyncTweedies".

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis comparing all possible options for synchronizing multiple diffusion processes 
- Revealing SyncTweedies provides best quality and widest applicability across applications
- Applications to diverse visual content generation tasks, including ambiguous images, panoramas, mesh textures and Gaussian splat textures
- Demonstrating superior performance of SyncTweedies over other synchronization options, optimization-based and iterative update-based methods

The key insight is that denoising is robust when aggregating the outputs of Tweedie's formula but sensitive to predicted noise and intermediate noisy data points. Thus, SyncTweedies, which synchronizes the Tweedie outputs, can handle various projection functions between spaces and has wide applicability.
