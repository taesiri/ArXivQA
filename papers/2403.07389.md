# [Auxiliary CycleGAN-guidance for Task-Aware Domain Translation from   Duplex to Monoplex IHC Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- CycleGANs enable image translation between two domains, relying on cycle consistency to learn a bijective mapping. However, this assumption fails for translating between duplex (two stains) and monoplex (one stain) immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, as multiple signals can map to one but not vice versa.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce an auxiliary immunofluorescence (IF) domain to guide the duplex to monoplex translation. 
- Leverage ReStainGAN to model staining between IF and hematoxylin-DAB-eosin (HDE). Manipulate IF markers to generate synthetic monoplex images from duplex.
- Use synthetic monoplex to guide direct duplex to monoplex translation model. Combine translation model with existing monoplex segmentation model for use on duplex images.

Key Contributions:
- Novel auxiliary domain CycleGAN design using IF images to enable task-aware (segmentation) duplex to monoplex translation.
- Stain manipulation on IF images to generate synthetic monoplex guidance images.
- Quantitative and qualitative segmentation results showing proposed model outperforms CycleGAN baseline.
- Enables use of existing trained monoplex models on duplex images without model retraining.

In summary, the paper introduces a new training methodology to address limitations of CycleGANs in translating between duplex and monoplex IHC images for the end goal of enabling downstream analysis tasks. Key ideas include guidance from an IF auxiliary domain and stain content manipulation. Experiments validate the benefit over baseline approaches.
