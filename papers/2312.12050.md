# [Extension of the Dip-test Repertoire -- Efficient and Differentiable   p-value Calculation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Dip test is a useful statistical test for determining if a dataset is unimodal or multimodal. It outputs a Dip value and corresponding Dip p-value. 
- Translating the Dip value to Dip p-value is important for properly interpreting the test results. 
- Current methods use lookup tables or bootstrapping which have limitations: not differentiable for use in gradient-based methods, limited to maximum sample sizes, and slow computation.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a differentiable sigmoid function to translate Dip values to Dip p-values for any sample size. 
- The function is fitted to an enlarged lookup table and models the translation as dependent on the sample size N. It has only a few parameters.
- This provides a fast, automatic translation of Dip values to p-values for any N. It is also smooth and continuously differentiable.

Key Contributions:
- The fitted translation function provides Dip p-values that are reliable and consistent with prior methods.
- It is faster to compute than lookup tables or bootstrapping, especially for large N. Saves 50-99% runtime for example methods.  
- The differentiability enables use in gradient-based learning methods. This is showcased in a new subspace clustering algorithm called Dip'n'Sub.
- Dip'n'Sub finds a common subspace for all clusters using gradient of the Dip p-values. It shows strong performance compared to other subspace and Dip-based methods.

In summary, the paper presents an improved way to translate Dip test outputs to p-values. This enables faster computation and integration into gradient-based methods for applications like the showcased subspace clustering algorithm.
