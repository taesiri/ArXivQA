# [CODEX: A Cluster-Based Method for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04216)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new method called Counterfactual Demonstrations for Explanation (CODEX) to help explain the behavior of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. CODEX summarizes the agent's behavior in natural language by semantically clustering the state-action spaces over episodes of interaction with an environment. Experiments demonstrate CODEX on the MiniGrid and StarCraft II gaming simulations. The semantic clusters retain temporal as well as entity information, reflected in the constructed summary of agent behavior. By visualizing clusters of the discrete+continuous game-state latent representations, CODEX identifies the most crucial episodic events and demonstrates a relationship between the latent and semantic spaces. This contributes to research in explainable RL by using natural language processing to provide interpretable explanations aimed at unlocking the potential of RL for more widespread, practical applications. Overall, CODEX generates intuitive explanations by summarizing factual and counterfactual examples of agent behavior based on the agent's learned world model.
