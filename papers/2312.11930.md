# [Collision-Free Navigation of Wheeled Mobile Robots: An Integrated Path   Planning and Tube-Following Control Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of collision-free navigation for wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) operating in a compact convex workspace cluttered with multiple spherical obstacles. Specifically, the goal is to develop a control scheme that can drive the WMR from an initial configuration to a designated goal location in the free space, while avoiding collisions with obstacles along the route. This is challenging due to the nonholonomic kinematics of WMRs and the presence of disturbances.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an integrated path planning and tube-following control approach. Key ideas include:

1) Selecting an off-center point on the WMR as a virtual control point to transform the nonholonomic kinematics into a fully-actuated system. 

2) Designing a path planner based on Bouligand's tangent cones and Nagumo's invariance theorem. The planner generates a continuous, saturated navigation vector field that asymptotically guides the WMR to the goal from almost all initial positions, without entering augmented obstacle regions.

3) Constructing a virtual safe tube around the reference trajectory produced by the path planner. The tube radius is set to be smaller than the obstacle safety margin. 

4) Developing an adaptive tube-following controller that drives the WMR to track the planned trajectory inside the safe tube despite disturbances, while ensuring uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking errors.


Main Contributions:

1) An integrated path planning and control scheme for collision-free WMR navigation in cluttered workspaces. The method requires only local sensing of obstacles.

2) A novel path planner built upon tangent cones and Nagumo's theorem, enabling automatic generation of navigation vector fields with almost global convergence, without tedious parameter tuning.

3) Introduction of the tube-following control notion to safe robot navigation problems, with tube radius linking explicitly to the safety margin from obstacles.

4) Rigorous stability analysis to guarantee tracking accuracy, error bounds, and obstacle avoidance in perturbed scenarios.

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated in simulations and experiments involving a differential-drive WMR navigating in an arena among heated spherical obstacles.
