# [On the Fly Detection of Root Causes from Observed Data with Application   to IT Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on detecting root causes of anomalies in IT systems based on time series data. In many IT systems, thresholds are used to determine when an anomaly should be triggered. Identifying causal relationships between raw time series is difficult, but studying causal relationships between binary thresholded time series can provide more insights. The goal is to leverage historical data to infer causal graphs, and use these graphs to rapidly deduce root causes when new anomalies occur.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a new structural causal model called Threshold-based Dynamic Structural Causal Model (T-DSCM) tailored to represent threshold-based IT systems. It represents causal relationships between binary thresholded time series. Based on the T-DSCM, the paper defines the concepts of Threshold-based Full-time Causal Graph (T-FTCG) and its summary version Threshold-based Summary Causal Graph (T-SCG).

The paper then presents an algorithm called T-RCA that first uses causal discovery on historical offline data to learn a T-SCG. Then, when new anomalies occur in online monitoring data, it employs a graph traversal strategy to deduce the root causes directly from the T-SCG. T-RCA is proven to correctly identify all root causes if they are not causally related.

To relax this assumption, an extension called T-RCA-agent is proposed that iterates between running T-RCA to identify some root causes, having an agent resolve the associated incidents, and rerunning T-RCA on remaining anomalies until no anomaly persists.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of new structural causal models tailored for threshold-based IT systems
- T-RCA algorithm that combines offline causal discovery and online graph traversal to rapidly deduce root causes
- Theoretical guarantee on correctness of T-RCA under some assumptions 
- T-RCA-agent extension for relaxing assumptions by iteratively applying T-RCA and resolving incidents
- Extensive experiments on simulated and real data demonstrating superior performance over baselines

The main advantage of the approach is it does not require continuous causal relationships to exist in the system, and instead focuses on emerging event-driven causal relationships. This makes it well suited for complex IT systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new structural causal model for representing threshold-based IT systems and a new algorithm leveraging causal discovery on historical data to rapidly detect root causes of anomalies in such systems by traversing a learned causal graph when new anomalies appear.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new structural causal model tailored for representing threshold-based IT systems (called T-DSCM) and a new algorithm called T-RCA for detecting root causes of anomalies in such systems. Specifically:

- It introduces the T-DSCM, which is designed to model IT systems where causal relationships emerge based on thresholds rather than at every time step. This allows capturing event-driven causal mechanisms.

- It presents T-RCA, an algorithm that first learns a threshold-based causal graph from historical data, then leverages this graph to rapidly detect root causes of anomalies when they appear in new data by traversing the graph.

- T-RCA is theoretically proven to correctly identify root causes under an additional assumption. When this assumption is violated, an extension called T-RCA-agent is proposed that involves an external agent iteratively resolving anomalies.

- Extensive experiments on simulated and real IT monitoring data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for root cause analysis, outperforming existing approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a causal modeling and root cause analysis framework tailored to handle event-driven threshold-based IT systems. Both the new structural causal model and algorithm for detecting root causes specifically target such systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new structural causal model called the Threshold-based Dynamic Structural Causal Model (T-DSCM). How is this model different from traditional structural causal models and why is it useful for modeling IT systems?

2. The paper proposes the T-RCA algorithm for detecting root causes of anomalies. Explain the key steps of this algorithm and the theoretical guarantees it provides under certain assumptions. How does it leverage both causal discovery and graph traversal?

3. Assumption 5 in the paper states that there cannot be more than one root cause in an active path that violates Assumption 4. Explain why this assumption is needed and discuss scenarios where it may not hold in practice. How does the paper address violations of this assumption?

4. Explain the difference between the Threshold-based Full-time Causal Graph (T-FTCG) and the Threshold-based Summary Causal Graph (T-SCG). Under what conditions does relying on the T-SCG suffice for detecting root causes?

5. Lemmas 1 and 2 provide graph-based rules for identifying certain root causes. Provide an intuitive explanation of these lemmas and explain how they are used within the T-RCA algorithm. 

6. The T-RCA agent extension engages an agent to iteratively resolve incidents and rerun detection. Explain how this addresses violations of Assumption 4. What is the theoretical bound on the number of iterations required?

7. The paper demonstrates superior performance over baselines on simulated T-DSCM data. However, T-RCA also performs well on data generated from other models. Hypothesize reasons for this observed robustness.

8. Real IT monitoring data is used to evaluate methods, but the ground truth graph is not known. Discuss the limitations of evaluating methods in such scenarios and suggest ways to mitigate them.  

9. The paper assumes no instantaneous causal relations in the T-DSCM. Discuss how T-RCA could be extended to allow such relations and the associated challenges.

10. A key premise of the paper is transforming continuous time series into binary ones using thresholds. Critically analyze the benefits and potential limitations of relying solely on thresholded data for causal discovery and root cause analysis.
