# [Event-based Shape from Polarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06855)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to overcome the speed-resolution tradeoff in Shape from Polarization (SfP) using event cameras. 

Specifically, the authors aim to develop an SfP approach that can operate at high acquisition speeds while retaining high spatial resolution, overcoming limitations of current frame-based SfP methods. The key hypothesis is that by using an event camera with a rotating polarizer, the continuous stream of events can be exploited to estimate surface normals with both high speed and high resolution.

To summarize, the key research question is:

Can an event camera-based approach for Shape from Polarization achieve high acquisition speeds while maintaining high spatial resolution for surface normal estimation?

The paper then proposes both physics-based and learning-based methods to tackle this question on synthetic and real datasets. The results demonstrate that the event-based approach can indeed overcome limitations of frame-based SfP methods.
