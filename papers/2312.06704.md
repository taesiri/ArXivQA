# [SIFU: Side-view Conditioned Implicit Function for Real-world Usable   Clothed Human Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating high-quality 3D models of clothed humans from single images is crucial for many applications like VR/AR, 3D printing, and scene creation. However, existing methods struggle with complex poses, loose clothing, and predicting realistic textures for unseen areas in the input image. The key limitations are:

1) Insufficient integration of priors when translating 2D image features to 3D, limiting reconstruction accuracy. 

2) Lack of texture priors resulting in unsatisfactory textures, especially for invisible regions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SIFU, a novel approach with two main components:

1) Side-view Conditioned Implicit Function: Employs a transformer architecture using SMPL-X normals as queries to perform cross-attention with image features. This decouples side-view features effectively when mapping 2D to 3D, enhancing reconstruction accuracy and robustness.

2) 3D Consistent Texture Refinement: Leverages text-to-image diffusion models and ensures uniform diffusion features across views for consistent texture generation. This significantly improves texture quality and realism.

Main Contributions:

- A Side-view Conditioned Implicit Function that uses human priors to decouple side-view 3D features, advancing clothed human reconstruction.

- A 3D Consistent Texture Refinement pipeline for high-quality, realistic textures suitable for downstream applications.  

- State-of-the-art performance in both geometry (0.6 cm Chamfer) and texture reconstruction. Robust to complex poses, loose clothing, and SMPL-X errors.

- Ability to extend to real-world applications like 3D printing and scene creation that were previously challenging.

In summary, SIFU pushes the boundary in reconstructing usable 3D clothed humans from single images through innovative use of priors for geometry and textures.
