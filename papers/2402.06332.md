## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "InternLM-Math: Open Math Large Language Models Toward Verifiable Reasoning":

Problem:
- Mathematical reasoning is an important capability for large language models (LLMs) to demonstrate abstract reasoning skills. However, existing math-focused LLMs mainly focus on solving problems informally using chain-of-thought, lacking abilities for formal verification or improvement.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes InternLM-Math, a series of mathematical reasoning LLMs built upon InternLM2.
- InternLM-Math unifies chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling for verification, formal reasoning, data augmentation, and code interpretation under a unified seq2seq format. 
- It is supervised to be not only a problem solver, but also a verifier, prover and data augmenter for self-improvement.

Main Contributions:
- Releases SOTA open-sourced LLMs for math reasoning under different settings.
- Unifies multiple math abilities into a seq2seq format and supervises both problem solving and verification.
- Proposes reasoning interleaved with coding, allowing seamless integration of symbolic reasoning and program execution.  
- Explores using Lean theorem prover to solve and prove problems, showing the possibility of using Lean as a unified platform.
- The model, code and data are open-sourced to facilitate research into verifiable reasoning.

In summary, the paper proposes InternLM-Math as an open-sourced mathematical reasoning LLM with integrated abilities for problem solving, verification and improvement, demonstrating strong performance and potential for developing verifiable reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces InternLM-Math, an open-source large language model for mathematical reasoning that achieves state-of-the-art performance on informal and formal math benchmarks through pre-training on math data and supervised fine-tuning for abilities like chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling, data augmentation, and LEAN-based formal verification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. Open-sourcing base and supervised fine-tuned large language models for mathematical reasoning that achieve state-of-the-art performance under various settings on informal and formal math benchmarks.

2. Unifying chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling, data augmentation, and formal reasoning into a single seq2seq format to train models with both problem-solving and verification abilities.

3. Proposing reasoning interleaved with coding (RICO) to seamlessly integrate code interpreter capabilities with reasoning in a format compatible with general chat services.

4. Exploring using the LEAN formal math language to solve word problems in addition to proving, as well as studying LEAN performance under multi-task learning which shows potential for using LEAN as a unified platform.

5. Releasing the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, training codes, and data to facilitate research into developing next-generation mathematical reasoning abilities for large language models.

In summary, the key contribution is open-sourcing strong math reasoning models with versatile abilities that can serve as a starting point for iterative self-improvement, enabled by the unification of multiple mathematical capabilities into a single framework.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions training reward modeling helps the model better rerank its generation. What are the key challenges in designing an effective reward modeling approach for mathematics problems? How does this paper address those challenges?

2. The paper integrates multiple abilities like chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling, data augmentation etc. under a unified seq2seq format. What are the advantages and potential issues with this unified framework? How can the issues be mitigated?  

3. The paper proposes using LEAN as a unified interface for solving and proving math problems. What modifications need to be made to LEAN to make it more amenable as an interface language? What can be done to handle the sparsity issue when using LEAN?

4. The paper finds that simply adding scratchpad-like calculation data does not influence model calculation behavior due to "calculation hallucination". What are some ways this issue can be addressed beyond the matching and rewriting approach proposed? Are there ways to avoid explicit rewriting altogether?

5. The paper explores reasoning interleaved with coding (RICO) to exploit capabilities of both reasoning and code execution. What enhancements can be made to the interaction protocol between reasoning and code execution to make it more natural and seamless?

6. What potential issues need to be considered in using open-sourced LLMs to generate training data for abilities like formal reasoning and code interpretation? How can the authors mitigate possible contamination issues?

7. What are some ways the false positive issue in the MATH benchmark identified in the paper can be addressed? Would enhancing process checking with reward models and LEAN suffice or would additional measures be needed?

8. How suitable is the MiniF2F benchmark for evaluating formal reasoning capabilities compared to real-world math proving challenges? What additional benchmarking tasks would better evaluate formal reasoning strengths?

9. The paper finds reasoning performance is less sensitive to LEAN data size when trained jointly with MetaMath. What are some ways multi-task learning can be further exploited to improve learning of sparse abilities?

10. What potential ethical concerns need to be considered with large language models that are specialized in mathematical reasoning? How can issues like bias, safety and transparency be addressed?
