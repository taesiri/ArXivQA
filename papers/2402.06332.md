## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "InternLM-Math: Open Math Large Language Models Toward Verifiable Reasoning":

Problem:
- Mathematical reasoning is an important capability for large language models (LLMs) to demonstrate abstract reasoning skills. However, existing math-focused LLMs mainly focus on solving problems informally using chain-of-thought, lacking abilities for formal verification or improvement.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes InternLM-Math, a series of mathematical reasoning LLMs built upon InternLM2.
- InternLM-Math unifies chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling for verification, formal reasoning, data augmentation, and code interpretation under a unified seq2seq format. 
- It is supervised to be not only a problem solver, but also a verifier, prover and data augmenter for self-improvement.

Main Contributions:
- Releases SOTA open-sourced LLMs for math reasoning under different settings.
- Unifies multiple math abilities into a seq2seq format and supervises both problem solving and verification.
- Proposes reasoning interleaved with coding, allowing seamless integration of symbolic reasoning and program execution.  
- Explores using Lean theorem prover to solve and prove problems, showing the possibility of using Lean as a unified platform.
- The model, code and data are open-sourced to facilitate research into verifiable reasoning.

In summary, the paper proposes InternLM-Math as an open-sourced mathematical reasoning LLM with integrated abilities for problem solving, verification and improvement, demonstrating strong performance and potential for developing verifiable reasoning.
