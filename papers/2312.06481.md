# [Measuring the perception of the personalized activities with CloudIA   robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06481)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the CloudIA robot, a non-humanlike robotic platform designed through a human-centered approach to support caregivers in nursing home settings. The robot was tested with 15 older adults across two nursing facilities to provide personalized services, including administering psycho-cognitive assessments and encouraging social interactions through music therapy. Both quantitative engagement metrics and qualitative feedback were used to evaluate the robot's feasibility. Results showed that despite CloudIA's machine-like appearance, participants interacted with it naturally as a social agent, "humanizing" it and establishing an emotional connection. Introducing the robot enriched both individual human-robot interactions as well as group social dynamics compared to standard caregiver-only activities. The type of interaction and activity also affected engagement levels - the focused nature of the 1-on-1 cognitive testing lent itself to more consistent attention, while group music therapy promoted high interest but some variability in participation when the robot engaged others. Overall, both the participants and caregivers responded positively, supporting CloudIA's ability to provide personalized roles assisting caregiver duties and enhancing user experience, though some technical refinements are still needed regarding autonomy and speech.
