# [Fine-Tuning InstructPix2Pix for Advanced Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04780)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach to colorizing black-and-white images of human faces by fine-tuning the InstructPix2Pix model. InstructPix2Pix integrates a language model (GPT-3) with a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) to enable image editing based on textual instructions. However, it performs poorly on specialized colorization tasks. To address this, the authors fine-tuned InstructPix2Pix on the IMDB-WIKI facial image dataset using varied colorization prompts from ChatGPT paired with black-and-white images. They froze unrelated components and focused on fine-tuning the image denoising U-Net. Their method contributes by applying fine-tuning to stable diffusion models specifically for colorization and using generative models to create diverse conditioning prompts. Results show their approach qualitatively generates more realistic colors compared to the original model. Quantitatively, it improves on metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and MAE. The code is available on GitHub. Future work involves unifying the noise prediction and color fidelity loss functions during training for more consistent improvements.
