# [LLM-Resistant Math Word Problem Generation via Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are advancing rapidly and can now solve math word problems, raising concerns about their use for academic dishonesty.  
- Existing plagiarism detection methods struggle to keep pace with LLMs' capabilities.
- There is a need for new methods to ensure fair student evaluation and assess true problem-solving abilities. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new paradigm - generating adversarial math word problems that preserve structure/difficulty but which LLMs cannot solve. 
- Problems are converted to code using GPT-4, then an abstract syntax tree (AST) represents the code. 
- By modifying numeric values in the AST tree nodes, many adversarial variants of the original problem are systematically generated.  
- Constraints are added to filter valid problems and preserve coherence, style and difficulty.

Key Contributions:
- Adversarial math problems are generated which cause significant performance degradation across major open-source and closed-source LLMs.
- A cost-effective targeted attack approach can reduce API requests to expensive models like GPT-4 by 90% without sacrificing attack success rate.
- Analysis identifies shared mathematical vulnerabilities amongst LLMs, with problem answer value and operation counts strongly correlated with correctness.
- Human evaluations confirm adversarial problems remain valid, coherent and have similar difficulty to originals.
- This work pioneers a new paradigm for ensuring fair LLM evaluation in education while providing insights into deficiencies in LLM math problem solving.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions around developing adversarial math problems to challenge LLMs, preserving fairness in educational evaluation. The analysis also yields valuable discoveries into limitations of LLMs' mathematical capabilities.
