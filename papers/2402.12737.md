# [Guarantee Regions for Local Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Local interpretability methods like LIME explain model behavior using simple surrogate models (e.g. linear models) fitted locally around a point. However, it is unclear how far these local explanations can be extrapolated/trusted. The paper aims to explicitly identify regions (anchor boxes) where the local explanations are guaranteed to faithfully match the complex model's predictions.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first proves that exactly finding the maximum faithfulness region (anchor box) requires exponentially many evaluations, making it intractable.

- A divide-and-conquer algorithm is proposed that recursively builds up anchor boxes from lower to higher dimensions. It first finds 1D anchor boxes along each feature. Then it combines anchor boxes from pairs of features to get 2D boxes and so on until it gets the full D-dimensional box.

- At each step, it uses an adapted max-box search algorithm to find the largest box with high purity (fraction of faithful points). The max box algorithm is constrained to be inside previously found lower-dimensional boxes. Statistical tests are used to verify purity.

- This approach approximates the maximum anchor box well when the faithfulness function satisfies a nestedness property: the region for a set of features is inside the region for its subset features.

Contributions:

- Proves that finding the exact maximum anchor box is exponentially hard 

- Provides an efficient divide-and-conquer approximation algorithm for finding large high-purity anchor boxes  

- Empirically demonstrates the algorithm can detect misleading explanations and finds boxes covering more of the underlying data density

- Shows anchor boxes successfully applied to complex models (random forests) on real-world tabular datasets with up to 30 features
