# [New Job, New Gender? Measuring the Social Bias in Image Generation   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image generation models can produce high-quality images from text descriptions. However, they are prone to generating biased content that perpetuates stereotypes related to gender, race, and age. Evaluating such biases is challenging - prior methods have limitations in accuracy, rely extensively on human labor, and fail to provide comprehensive analysis across demographic groups.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes BiasPainter, a novel metamorphic testing framework to accurately, automatically and comprehensively reveal hidden social biases in image generation models. 

It uses seed images of individuals across races, genders and ages. These seed images are input to the image generation models, along with gender/race/age neutral prompts spanning occupations, activities, personalities and objects. BiasPainter then checks if the edited output image has significantly altered gender, race or age compared to the seed image. Such changes imply biased associations between the prompt and demographic groups.

The bias identification builds computer vision pipelines leveraging libraries like Dlib and APIs like Face++. Further, the framework quantifies bias in terms of scores for images, prompts and at an overall model level.

Main Contributions:
- Design of BiasPainter - the first metamorphic testing framework to automatically and comprehensively evaluate social biases in image generation models
- Extensive empirical evaluation on 5 widely used commercial systems and research models, successfully triggering substantial biased generations
- Analysis providing insights into different biases within models; framework can aid developers in bias mitigation 
- Release of dataset, framework code and results to facilitate real-world testing and further research

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards testing and mitigating issues of fairness and transparency in emerging generative AI systems. The proposed rigorous framework for bias evaluation is timely and impactful.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel metamorphic testing framework, BiasPainter, that can automatically, comprehensively, and accurately trigger and measure social bias in image generation models by inputting seed images and neutral prompts, generating edited images, assessing changes in race/gender/age properties, and detecting biases based on defined metamorphic relations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Designing and implementing BiasPainter, the first metamorphic testing framework for comprehensively measuring social biases in image generation models.

2. Performing an extensive evaluation of BiasPainter on five widely deployed commercial image generation systems and research models. The results demonstrate that BiasPainter can effectively trigger a large amount of biased behavior. 

3. Releasing the dataset, code of BiasPainter, and all experimental results, which can facilitate real-world fairness testing tasks and further follow-up research.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing BiasPainter, a novel testing framework that can automatically, comprehensively, and accurately reveal hidden social biases in image generation models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Metamorphic testing: A testing technique used to address the oracle problem by checking for violations of metamorphic relations across multiple runs of the software under test. This is the core testing approach used in the paper.

- Social bias: Discrimination for or against a person or group in an unfair or prejudicial manner. Measuring and mitigating social bias is a major focus of the paper.

- Image generation models: Models that generate images from text descriptions. Assessing bias in major commercial image generation models is the domain application.

- Seed images: Diverse set of images of people used as inputs to image generation models. Changes between seed images and generated images are analyzed.

- Gender, race, age: Demographic attributes focused on when analyzing bias. The framework examines biases related to gender, race, and age stereotypes.  

- Fairness, model bias scores: Terminology and metrics used to quantify overall model fairness based on detected biases.

- Prompts, prompt lists: Text descriptions input to models to generate images. Prompt lists spanning occupations, activities, etc. are designed to be neutral.

- Metamorphic relations: Relations between inputs and outputs that should hold, violations of which indicate a problem. The core relation is that neutral prompts should not significantly alter seed image attributes.

In summary, the key concepts cover the metamorphic testing approach, social biases, image generation models, and terminology around analyzing demographic biases and model fairness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel metamorphic testing framework called BiasPainter. What is the key insight behind using metamorphic testing to measure bias in image generation models? How does the framework leverage this insight?

2. Seed image collection is an important first step in BiasPainter. What considerations went into selecting the seed images used in the evaluation? How might the choice of seed images impact the effectiveness of bias measurement?  

3. Explain the image processing pipeline used to analyze skin tone and quantify changes in race between seed and generated images. What are some limitations of using pixel values as a proxy for race?

4. The paper uses commercial APIs for gender and age detection. What are some drawbacks of relying on these systems? Could inaccuracies propagate and impact bias measurement?

5. For calculating word-level bias scores, the scores of all generated images for a word are averaged. What are other potential approaches for aggregating scores to quantify bias at the word-level? What are the tradeoffs?

6. When measuring bias mitigation impacts, the paper adds an explicit "maintain gender/race/age" prompt. What other prompting strategies could be used to mitigate bias? How can BiasPainter be used to evaluate mitigation techniques?

7. The scope of bias measurement is currently limited to gender, race, and age. What other attributes could BiasPainter be extended to cover? What challenges might this present?

8. The paper acknowledges threats regarding the comprehensiveness of the input data. What techniques could strengthen confidence in the coverage and representativeness of the seed images and prompts selected?

9. What other kinds of metamorphic relations, beyond maintaining gender/age/race with neutral prompts, could expose additional biases in image generation models?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on measuring bias for further mitigation. Could BiasPainter ever be used by malicious actors to intentionally introduce or amplify harms? How might the framework guard against these risks?
