# [Beyond Suspension: A Two-phase Methodology for Concluding Sports Leagues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Professional sports leagues may need to be suspended due to reasons like the COVID-19 pandemic. When resuming a suspended season, a critical question is how to appropriately select a subset of the remaining games to conclude the season in a shortened timeframe. The goal is to achieve team rankings at the end of the shortened season that are as close as possible to the rankings that would have resulted had the full season been played.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a two-phase analytics approach that combines predictive and prescriptive analytics. 

In the predictive phase, historical game data is used to train binary classification models to predict the outcomes of the remaining games in the season. Features like team win percentages and point differentials are used. The best model is selected based on proper scoring rules like LogLoss.

In the prescriptive phase, stochastic optimization models are formulated to select a subset of the remaining games so that the expected dissimilarity between the shortened season's ranking and the full season's ranking is minimized. Two dissimilarity measures are used - concordance and Euclidean distance between rankings. Different variants of the stochastic optimization problem are solved using techniques like sample average approximation, robust optimization, and Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

The overall framework uses the predictive model's estimated probabilities of game outcomes in the optimization model to prescribe an optimal shortened season.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates the problem of optimally resuming a suspended sports season as a two-phase predictive-prescriptive analytics problem

- Introduces novel stochastic optimization models with ranking-based objectives to select a subset of remaining games  

- Proposes multiple solution techniques including a tailored Frank-Wolfe algorithm that efficiently solves a deterministic equivalent reformulation

- Extensive computational experiments using 14 NBA seasons show the proposed approach efficiently produces high-quality shortened seasons that yield team rankings highly concordant with full season rankings

- Demonstrates practical viability by correctly selecting playoff teams and draft lottery teams with over 90% accuracy compared to the full season

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing an end-to-end data-driven approach for optimally resuming suspended sports seasons.
