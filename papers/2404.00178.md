# [Beyond Suspension: A Two-phase Methodology for Concluding Sports Leagues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Professional sports leagues may need to be suspended due to reasons like the COVID-19 pandemic. When resuming a suspended season, a critical question is how to appropriately select a subset of the remaining games to conclude the season in a shortened timeframe. The goal is to achieve team rankings at the end of the shortened season that are as close as possible to the rankings that would have resulted had the full season been played.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a two-phase analytics approach that combines predictive and prescriptive analytics. 

In the predictive phase, historical game data is used to train binary classification models to predict the outcomes of the remaining games in the season. Features like team win percentages and point differentials are used. The best model is selected based on proper scoring rules like LogLoss.

In the prescriptive phase, stochastic optimization models are formulated to select a subset of the remaining games so that the expected dissimilarity between the shortened season's ranking and the full season's ranking is minimized. Two dissimilarity measures are used - concordance and Euclidean distance between rankings. Different variants of the stochastic optimization problem are solved using techniques like sample average approximation, robust optimization, and Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

The overall framework uses the predictive model's estimated probabilities of game outcomes in the optimization model to prescribe an optimal shortened season.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates the problem of optimally resuming a suspended sports season as a two-phase predictive-prescriptive analytics problem

- Introduces novel stochastic optimization models with ranking-based objectives to select a subset of remaining games  

- Proposes multiple solution techniques including a tailored Frank-Wolfe algorithm that efficiently solves a deterministic equivalent reformulation

- Extensive computational experiments using 14 NBA seasons show the proposed approach efficiently produces high-quality shortened seasons that yield team rankings highly concordant with full season rankings

- Demonstrates practical viability by correctly selecting playoff teams and draft lottery teams with over 90% accuracy compared to the full season

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing an end-to-end data-driven approach for optimally resuming suspended sports seasons.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-phase analytics approach to shorten a suspended professional sports league regular season by selecting a subset of the remaining games to play so that the resulting end-of-season team rankings closely resemble what would have occurred had the full season been completed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a two-phase analytics approach for selecting a subset of games to conclude a shortened sports league season, with the goal of achieving end-of-season rankings similar to those that would result from playing the full season. 

The main contributions are:

1) A predictive modeling phase that estimates the probability of each team winning their remaining games after a season suspension, using historical game data.

2) A prescriptive modeling phase that formulates the game selection problem as a stochastic optimization model maximizing similarity between the shortened season's rankings and the full season's counterfactual rankings. Several variants are proposed, including novel ranking-based objectives.

3) Efficient solution methods for the resulting intractable stochastic optimization problems, including a deterministic reformulation, a tailored Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and a robust optimization approach.  

4) Extensive computational experiments on 14 NBA seasons evaluating the practical performance of the proposed models using metrics tied to playoff qualification, draft order, etc. The models efficiently produce shortened seasons that yield rankings highly consistent with the full season.

In summary, the key innovation is a data-driven decision methodology that uses predictive analytics and stochastic optimization to prescribe a shortened sports season ensuring fairness in terms of season-ending rankings and playoff qualifications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-phase approach combining predictive and prescriptive analytics. Can you elaborate on why this combination is useful and what each phase contributes? 

2. One of the key ideas in the paper is approximating the ranking similarity objective with a win percentage difference objective. What is the rationale behind this approximation and what are its advantages?

3. The paper introduces several variants of the prescriptive model PW, including a deterministic equivalent (PW-DQIP), a Frank-Wolfe algorithm (PW-FW), and a robust optimization version (PW-MMR). Can you compare and contrast these methods and when one might be preferred over the others? 

4. How exactly does the Frank-Wolfe algorithm exploit the structure of the feasibility set X to efficiently solve PW-DQIP? Can you walk through the key steps and explain the intuition?  

5. What is the role of the variance term in the PW-DQIP objective function? How does its coefficient change based on the length of the shortened season and what does this imply about the type of games favored?

6. The paper introduces several metrics for evaluating the quality of a shortened season, including concordance, playoff team agreement, and strength of schedule discrepancy. Can you explain each of these and why they are relevant?

7. One of the key constraints added in the PW-SoS model limits the change in strength of schedule between the shortened and full seasons. What is the motivation behind this constraint and what does the Îµ parameter control?

8. The computational experiments leverage 14 seasons of NBA data. What are some key explanatory variables used by the predictive models and how could these models be adapted if no pre-suspension games were played, as in a lockout scenario?

9. Beyond the metrics analyzed in the paper, what are some other criteria one might want to consider when evaluating and selecting a good shortened season? 

10. If you were to extend this work, what are some modeling enhancements or additional analyses you might consider to further improve or refine the approach?
