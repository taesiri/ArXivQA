# [Advancing the Arabic WordNet: Elevating Content Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20215)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing Arabic WordNets (AWN) suffer from issues of correctness and completeness of words and word meanings. Problems include missing glosses/examples, incorrect lemmas, inadequate representation of Arabic language morphology/semantics.
- Previous efforts focused mainly on expanding coverage, ignoring qualitative aspects. 

Solution:
- Introduce AWN V3, a significantly revised version of AWN V1 with the following novel aspects:
   - Add glosses and examples to all synsets to clarify meaning
   - Improve correctness and completeness by fixing errors and adding missing lemmas
   - Reduce excessive polysemy by eliminating redundant word senses
   - Address language diversity issues causing untranslatability:
      - Introduce "lexical gaps" to explicitly indicate no Arabic equivalent exists for an English synset
      - Add "phrasets" - free word combinations to express meanings where no single equivalent Arabic word exists

Methodology:
- Follow an "expand model" approach to localize Princeton WordNet (PWN) synsets into Arabic
- Use two native Arabic speakers to provide translations, identify gaps, add phrasets
- Validation process by a linguistic expert to approve final synsets

Results:
- Updated over 58% of AWN V1 synsets by adding missing info and fixing errors 
- Added 2,726 new lemmas, 9,322 new glosses, 12,204 new examples
- Identified 236 lexical gaps, inserted 701 phrasets
- Correctness rate of contributions validated by expert was over 98%

Main Contributions:
- Extend Arabic WordNet model with new devices to handle untranslatability 
- High-quality methodology for developing lexical resources
- Release of significantly enhanced AWN V3 resource
