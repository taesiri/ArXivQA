# [Think you have Solved Question Answering? Try ARC, the AI2 Reasoning   Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05457)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The paper does not appear to state an explicit research question or hypothesis. However, the overall focus is on introducing and analyzing a new question answering dataset called the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC). Some key points about ARC:

- It consists of 7787 natural science questions taken from standardized tests, partitioned into an "Easy" set and a "Challenge" set. 

- The questions are designed to require more complex reasoning and knowledge than previous QA datasets like SQuAD. 

- The Challenge set contains only questions that are answered incorrectly by both a retrieval algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm, making it difficult for baseline methods.

- Along with the dataset, they provide a new corpus of science sentences relevant to ARC, and baseline results showing state-of-the-art QA models struggle on the Challenge set.

So in summary, the paper is presenting and analyzing this new dataset as a way to encourage research on more advanced reasoning for question answering. The central hypothesis is that ARC represents the kind of complex reasoning required to make further progress in QA.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new AI reasoning challenge called ARC, consisting of a dataset of 7787 science exam questions partitioned into an easy set and a more challenging set, plus a corpus of science sentences, in order to encourage research on more complex question answering requiring reasoning rather than just information retrieval or statistical correlation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research in question answering:

- The paper presents a new question answering dataset called ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) that focuses on grade-school science questions. Many other QA datasets like SQuAD, TriviaQA, etc. have focused more on factoid questions from Wikipedia, news, etc. So ARC provides questions that require more reasoning, especially scientific reasoning.

- The paper argues previous QA datasets have focused too much on "easy" questions that can be solved by surface-level cues like word matching. So they specifically construct a Challenge Set of questions in ARC that are not solvable by simple information retrieval or word co-occurrence methods. This pushes the field towards more complex reasoning.

- The authors test several strong baseline systems on ARC like neural entailment models, reading comprehension models, etc. But none significantly beat random guessing on the Challenge Set. So ARC poses a new challenge to the field that current state-of-the-art models struggle on.

- The paper releases not just the dataset but also a new science corpus and reference solvers to make it easy for others to work on ARC. Many other datasets just release questions. Providing the corpus and baselines makes it more accessible.

- Overall, ARC draws attention to more complex reasoning in QA, provides a specific challenge problem to drive research, and offers resources beyond just a question dataset. This is a notable contribution compared to most prior QA dataset papers. The authors make a compelling case this can push QA research in new directions.

In summary, the novelty of focusing on complex reasoning over factoid questions, constructing a Challenge Set, releasing supporting resources, and showing state-of-the-art models struggle on ARC distinguishes this paper from much of the prior work in QA dataset research. It makes a case for driving progress on deeper language understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several future research directions:

- Developing more advanced retrieval methods for the Challenge questions that require combining multiple facts. The current methods are biased towards sentences that match the question verbatim, but many Challenge questions require combining information from multiple sentences that each only partially match the question.

- Creating new methods for effectively combining information from multiple retrieved sentences. The authors note that current systems struggle to reason over retrieved information.

- Using the released ASC Corpus in novel ways to provide knowledge relevant to answering the questions. The authors mention the corpus contains relevant information but exploiting it is non-trivial.

- Developing systems that can handle the variety of knowledge and reasoning types exhibited in the Challenge set, as enumerated in Tables 2 and 3. Rather than handling just a narrow task, progress on ASC requires breadth.

- Expanding the scope of the Challenge set by adding more questions. The authors note its current size is limited by the availability of real standardized test questions.

- Using ASC as inspiration to create new Challenge sets in other domains that require reasoning. The authors suggest standardized tests could lead to Challenge sets in areas like history and social sciences.

- Trying completely different approaches to ASC that are uncorrelated with the surface-level IR methods the authors tried. The difficulty of the Challenge set suggests more advanced methods are needed.

In summary, the key directions are developing better retrieval and reasoning methods, leveraging the released corpus, expanding to broader knowledge and reasoning, increasing scale, and exploring radically different approaches to handle the difficulty of the questions. ASC provides a platform to drive this research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new question answering dataset called the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) designed to encourage research in advanced question answering that requires reasoning skills beyond simple retrieval or word correlations. The dataset contains 7,787 natural science exam questions partitioned into an Easy Set and a Challenge Set, where the Challenge Set contains only questions that cannot be correctly answered by a retrieval algorithm or word co-occurrence algorithm. Along with the dataset, the authors provide the ARC Corpus, a text corpus of 14M science sentences relevant to the task, and implementations of baseline neural QA models. Experiments with several baseline systems, including leading models from SQuAD and SNLI, show that none significantly outperform random guessing on the Challenge Set, demonstrating its difficulty. The authors pose ARC as an open challenge to the research community to develop methods that can substantially outperform the provided baselines on the Challenge Set, which would represent meaningful progress in advanced reasoning for question answering.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new question answering dataset called the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) intended to encourage more advanced reasoning capabilities in AI systems. The dataset contains 7787 natural science exam questions partitioned into a Challenge Set of 2590 questions that are not answered correctly by both an information retrieval and word co-occurrence baseline, and an Additional Set of 5197 easier questions. Analysis shows the Challenge Set requires a variety of reasoning skills beyond simple fact retrieval, including multi-hop reasoning, hypothetical reasoning, and analogy. To support work on ARC, the authors also release the ARC Corpus, a corpus of 14 million science sentences relevant to the task, and code for neural baseline models. Experiments with several baselines like DecompAttn, BiDAF, and DGEM show they perform poorly on the Challenge Set, near random guessing levels, illustrating the difficulty of these questions.

In summary, the ARC dataset and resources are intended to spur research towards more human-like reasoning and question answering capabilities, beyond the factoid retrieval questions in many existing QA datasets. By design the Challenge Set requires reasoning and inference skills not solved by current methods, evidenced by the poor performance of competitive baseline models like DecompAttn and BiDAF on this set. Progress on ARC would represent an important advance in deeper language understanding and reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method described in the paper:

The paper proposes using neural entailment models for answering multiple-choice science questions. To do this, they first convert each question and answer choice into a hypothesis sentence. They then use an information retrieval system to find relevant sentences from a science corpus to use as premises. The hypothesis sentence is paired with each retrieved premise sentence and fed into a neural entailment model to compute an entailment score. This is done for all answer choices. The answer choice that has the overall highest aggregated entailment score from the premises is selected as the predicted answer. Specifically, the paper experiments with two different neural entailment models - the Decomposable Attention Model and the Decomposed Graph Entailment Model. The Decomposed Graph Entailment Model incorporates graph structure extracted using OpenIE from the hypothesis, while the Decomposable Attention Model just operates on the raw text. Both models are trained on the SciTail dataset. The paper shows that this entailment-based approach can significantly outperform random guessing on a new science question dataset, demonstrating the promise of using neural entailment for question answering.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be introducing and describing a new dataset called the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC). The key problem it is trying to address is the limitation of recent QA datasets which have focused on simple factoid questions where surface cues alone are enough to find answers. This has not encouraged progress on questions requiring more complex reasoning. 

The paper argues that existing QA datasets have led to impressive algorithms, but these algorithms often exploit superficial cues and do not necessarily understand language or reasoning. Hence, progress on these datasets has not meant equal progress on harder questions involving deeper reasoning.

To address this limitation, the ARC dataset aims to pose questions that are challenging for current methods, particularly retrieval and word co-occurrence algorithms. The goal is to encourage research on more advanced QA capabilities like reasoning, use of common sense knowledge, and deeper language understanding.

In summary, the paper is introducing a new dataset to move question answering research towards more challenging questions that require reasoning, rather than just exploiting surface patterns. This is positioned as an AI reasoning challenge to motivate progress on harder QA problems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a combination of information retrieval (IR) and pointwise mutual information (PMI) to identify "challenge" science exam questions that are difficult for these basic methods to answer correctly. What are some potential limitations of using IR and PMI as the sole criteria to identify challenging questions? Could other methods besides IR and PMI also be used to filter the dataset?

2. The IR solver uses Elasticsearch to retrieve sentences from a corpus that contain the question and answer choice. How might more advanced semantic matching approaches, beyond just keyword overlap, improve the IR solver's performance on challenge questions?

3. The PMI solver calculates co-occurrence statistics between question words and answer words based on a 10-word window. How could the PMI approach be made more robust, for example by using variable window sizes or weighting word co-occurrences by syntactic relationships? 

4. The paper finds none of the baseline systems significantly outperform a random guesser on the Challenge set. What enhancements could be made to the neural entailment models (DecompAttn, DGEM) to make them more capable on complex science questions?

5. Could the neural entailment models be improved by using more advanced methods to convert the question + answer into an entailing hypothesis? The current approach is rather simplistic.

6. The released ARC Corpus was created through simple keyword searches over science topics. How could more advanced IR or ontology-based methods be used to create a more comprehensive corpus covering all necessary science knowledge?

7. Beyond the baseline systems tested, what other potential approaches could be explored for the challenge questions, for example systems that try to explicitly model multi-hop reasoning?

8. How suitable do you think standardized science exams are for pushing progress in advanced question answering compared to other potential challenge tasks? What are the pros and cons?

9. The paper analyzes the knowledge and reasoning types exhibited in the Challenge questions. Do you think these distributions are representative of the true underlying distributions, or are they skewed based on the nature of science exams?

10. How do you think progress on the ARC dataset would translate into real-world benefits for science education applications? What else would be needed to create a full science question answering tutor?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC), a new question answering dataset designed to encourage research in advanced reasoning and question answering. ARC consists of a collection of 7,787 natural science exam questions authored for standardized tests. The questions are partitioned into a Challenge Set and an Additional Set, where the Challenge Set contains questions that are not correctly answered by both an information retrieval method and a word co-occurrence method. This partitioning focuses research on the more difficult questions that require deeper reasoning. The authors analyze the types of knowledge and reasoning required by the Challenge Set, including conceptual knowledge, processes, teleology, experiments, algebra, explanations, analogies, and more. 

To support research on ARC, the authors also release the ARC Corpus, containing 14 million science sentences relevant to the task. They find the Corpus contains knowledge relevant to approximately 95% of the Challenge questions. Three neural baseline models are also provided: DecompAttn, BiDAF, and DGEM. While these achieve 60-70% on the Additional Set, none significantly exceed random guessing on the Challenge Set. This highlights the difficulty of ARC and the need for more advanced methods. Overall, ARC represents a substantive step towards question answering datasets requiring deeper reasoning, in contrast to previous factoid QA datasets. The authors put forward ARC as a challenge to the community, releasing the data, corpus, baselines, and leaderboard to track progress.
