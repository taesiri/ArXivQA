# [On the Emergence of Symmetrical Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "On the Emergence of Symmetrical Reality":

Problem:
- Existing frameworks like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) are human-centered and do not account for AI agents as additional perceptual centers. 
- Advancements in AI are enabling the development of intelligent agents capable of autonomous perception and action, further disrupting human-centered paradigms.
- There lacks a comprehensive framework that fully encompasses physical-virtual world integration across humans and AI agents.

Proposed Solution - Symmetrical Reality:
- A unified framework that integrates the physical and virtual worlds into a dual perceptual system centered around humans and AI agents. 
- Enables bidirectional interaction and information flow between humans (physical world) and AI agents (virtual world).
- Conceptualized on two key symmetrical attributes:
   1) Dual-center perception: Humans perceive physical and virtual worlds, AI agents perceive virtual and physical worlds
   2) Bidirectional interaction: Humans can influence virtual objects via avatars, AI agents can influence physical objects via embodiments

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive blueprint of the symmetrical reality framework encompassing components like virtual environments, AI agents, human-AI interaction etc.
- Analysis of emergence of symmetrical reality in light of advancements in AI and need for human-compatible AI systems.
- Demonstration of constructibility of symmetrical reality systems via example scenario of pouring water task.
- Proof-of-concept application scenarios in daily assistance to showcase applicability to real world.

The paper introduces a novel perspective on integrating physical and virtual worlds centered around both humans and AI agents. It has significant implications for continued research in human-AI coexistence and interaction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of symmetrical reality as a comprehensive framework for modeling physical-virtual world integration that considers both humans and autonomous AI agents as equivalent perceptual centers across dual realities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

(1) It introduces a comprehensive blueprint of the symmetrical reality (SR) framework, encompassing its theoretical foundations, technical challenges, and significance in light of advancements in artificial intelligence. 

(2) It examines the long-term coexistence of humans and AI agents within the SR framework to reveal the implications of human-compatible AI. It provides an example of constructing SR systems for the task of pouring water to demonstrate the complete architecture with simulated AI minds and bidirectional physical-virtual interaction.

(3) It showcases two system designs (inverse virtual reality and inverse augmented reality) along with a practical application scenario (active helping service) to demonstrate the applicability of SR to enhancing daily life. It also offers recommendations for the future development of SR.

In summary, the paper proposes the SR framework to describe the integration of physical and virtual worlds with dual perceptual centers, provides technical details and application examples, and discusses open challenges and future directions to guide research on human-AI coexistence across both physical and virtual environments.
