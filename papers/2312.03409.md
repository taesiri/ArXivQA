## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new convolutional neural network architecture called DeepPyramid+ for medical image and video segmentation. The key innovation is the incorporation of two new modules - Pyramid View Fusion (PVF) and Deformable Pyramid Reception (DPR) - to address major challenges like heterogeneity, deformability, blur, and transparent/blunt boundaries of objects typically encountered when segmenting medical images and videos. Specifically, PVF enhances representation of relative information at each pixel using a narrow-to-wide pyramid view while DPR introduces dilated deformable convolutions for shape- and scale-adaptive feature extraction. Experiments conducted on diverse medical image and video datasets spanning modalities like MRI, OCT, and cataract/laparoscopy videos demonstrate that DeepPyramid+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 17% higher Dice score for cross-domain segmentation tasks. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of both the PVF and DPR modules. Given its robustness and versatility, DeepPyramid+ shows promising potential to enhance precision for computerized analysis across medical imaging and surgical video applications.
