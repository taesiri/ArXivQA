# [Toward Adaptive Cooperation: Model-Based Shared Control Using   LQ-Differential Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In shared control systems where humans and automation share control tasks, modeling and adapting to the human's behavior is a key challenge. Humans adapt and change their behavior in response to the automation, so models purely based on identifying human behavior are insufficient. 
- There is a "chicken and egg" issue of needing to design the automation around the human's behavior while also needing to identify the human's changing behavior in response to that same automation.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an iterative online algorithm that combines identification of the human's behavior with adaptation of the automation's control policy.  
- Uses a differential game formulation with linear dynamics and quadratic cost functions to model the human and automation.
- Estimates control policies using recursive least squares method. 
- Identifies human cost function parameters using a reformulation of the algebraic Riccati equations.
- Adapts automation control policy to optimize global objective function and support changing human behavior.

Key Contributions:
- Unifies online identification and control design for shared control systems.
- Implements the algorithm for real-time adaptation during operation.
- Analyzes performance via simulations, highlighting benefits of proposed adaptive control over non-adaptive.
- Validates approach with human-in-loop experiments on a vehicle manipulator setup, demonstrating applicability to real systems.
- Provides first proof of concept for model-based adaptive shared control using differential game theory.

The paper introduces a novel method to address the key challenge of human adaptivity in shared control systems. By combining online identification and control adaptation, the automation can change its behavior to optimally cooperate with and assist the human operator as needed. Simulations and experiments validate the real-time feasibility.
