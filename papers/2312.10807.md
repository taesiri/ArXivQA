# [Language-conditioned Learning for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10807)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the emerging research area of language-conditioned robotic manipulation. The key problem tackled in this field is enabling robots to understand natural language instructions from humans and translate them into precise physical actions to manipulate objects in the real world. 

The paper first introduces key background concepts like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and large language models (LLMs). It then systematically reviews recent approaches for language-conditioned manipulation using reinforcement learning, imitation learning or leveraging capabilities of LLMs/VLMs (vision-language models).

Reinforcement learning methods treat language goals as rewards to optimize policies. Imitation learning methods leverage expert demonstrations to clone behaviors. LLMs like GPT-3 can generate plans and skills from language without much training data due to their pre-trained knowledge. 

The paper also provides an insightful comparative analysis across four aspects - semantic feature extraction, simulation environments, auxiliary prediction tasks, and task representations. It highlights advancements as well as limitations of existing methods.

Key contributions include:
(1) First comprehensive survey focused specifically on language conditioned robotic manipulation. 
(2) Structured analysis of research landscape categorizing approaches based on learning paradigms and integration of LLMs/VLMs.
(3) Comparative discussion across important factors to elucidate capabilities and gaps.
(4) Outlining promising future directions around generalization ability across language, vision and control modules along with handling safety challenges due to language ambiguity.

The survey will be valuable for researchers to obtain structured knowledge of prior arts and open challenges in enabling intuitive human-robot cooperation through language-based task commands.
