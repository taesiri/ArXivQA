# [Rethinking Detection Based Table Structure Recognition for Visually Rich   Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00699)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TSRDet, a Cascade R-CNN based detection model tailored for table structure recognition (TSR) in visually rich documents. The key contributions include: (1) refactoring the multi-label TSR definition into a regular single-label problem by generating pseudo-classes, enabling compatibility with two-stage detectors like Cascade R-CNN; (2) tuning anchor box aspect ratios and introducing spatial attention and deformable convolution to enrich long-range features for detecting table components which often have extreme aspect ratios; (3) comprehensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets using both detection and cell-level metrics. The paper also analyzes the limitations of using only detection metrics for TSR and compares two-stage vs transformer models. A key finding is that better detection performance does not necessarily yield better recovery of table structure. By carefully tailoring Cascade R-CNN to the TSR problem with simple but effective techniques, the proposed TSRDet advances the state-of-the-art while offering useful design insights for detection-based TSR.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes TSRDet, a Cascade R-CNN based detection model tailored for table structure recognition by refactoring the multi-label definition, tuning anchor box ratios, and incorporating spatial attention and deformable convolution to improve feature discrimination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It revisits popular detection-based TSR definitions and formulates the TSR problem as detecting six components: table, column, row, spanning cell, projected row header, and column header. It points out that this formulation is a multi-label detection problem which is challenging for two-stage detectors.

2. It identifies and analyzes critical design aspects for the success of a TSR model, including the aspect ratios in anchor box generation and discriminate feature generation. 

3. It proposes TSRDet, a tailored Cascade R-CNN based solution for TSR by adjusting aspect ratios, applying deformable convolution and introducing a spatial attention module. Without proposing new components, simple methods are applied to improve the Cascade R-CNN baseline significantly.

4. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed TSRDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSR datasets regarding both detection metrics and cell-level metrics. It also compares two-stage and transformer-based detectors and analyzes the impact of identified design aspects.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing TSRDet, an improved Cascade R-CNN solution for TSR, through revisiting problem formulation and identifying key design aspects. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that existing detection-based TSR solutions have certain limitations, such as over-simplifying the problem or defining a multi-label detection task. Can you expand on these limitations in more detail and explain why they are problematic? 

2. The paper proposes generating pseudo-classes to convert the multi-label detection problem into a regular single-label classification task. What is the rationale behind this approach and why does it help improve performance on a two-stage detector like Cascade R-CNN?

3. The Spatial Attention Module is designed to build long-range dependencies in the backbone features. How exactly does this module work? What types of convolutional operations are used and why?

4. Deformable convolution is also utilized in the proposed architecture. How does deformable convolution complement the Spatial Attention Module and help further enrich the features? 

5. The paper argues that suitable aspect ratios for anchor box generation and discriminate backbone features are two critical aspects for detection-based TSR success. Can you analyze why this is the case in more detail?  

6. The results show a misalignment between COCO metrics like mAP and the structure-only TEDS score. What causes this misalignment and why should both types of metrics be considered when evaluating TSR performance?

7. The paper includes comparisons to transformer-based detectors like Sparse R-CNN. What architectural differences allow Sparse R-CNN to naturally handle the multi-label problem definition? How do the learned features differ?

8. What modifications would need to be made to apply this Cascade R-CNN based architecture to irregular tables, like rotated or distorted tables? What are the main challenges?

9. Could pseudo-class generation be applied to other vision tasks with inherent multi-label classification challenges? What other areas could this idea be useful?

10. The paper focuses on well-formatted, visually rich documents. How would the performance of detection-based solutions like this degrade on low-quality document images? What are the main factors impacting robustness?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of table structure recognition (TSR) from visually rich documents. TSR aims to detect the structure of tables and transform them into structured formats like HTML. Existing detection-based TSR methods have the following limitations:
(1) They focus on improving detection performance but that does not necessarily improve cell-level metrics like TEDS after post-processing. 
(2) Some solutions oversimplify the problem and miss critical table structure information.
(3) Though some define 6 components (table, rows, columns, spanning cells, row headers, column headers), they ignore that some components like headers share identical boxes with rows/columns. This creates a multi-label detection problem that is challenging for two-stage detectors like Faster-RCNN and Cascade-RCNN. 
(4) There is still a performance gap in terms of structure-only TEDS between two-stage detectors and transformer-based detectors like DETR, even when their COCO detection metrics are similar.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TSRDet, a tailored Cascade R-CNN based solution for TSR. The key aspects are:
(1) Redefining the problem from multi-label to single-label detection by generating pseudo classes for overlapped boxes.
(2) Tuning anchor box ratios in RPN closer to the highly variable ratios of table components.  
(3) Using deformable convolutions to allow more flexible feature extraction.
(4) Adding a Spatial Attention Module that builds long range dependencies in the backbone features.

Contributions:  
The main contributions are:
(1) Revisiting limitations of existing detection-based TSR solutions.
(2) Comparing two-stage vs transformer detectors for TSR and analyzing key success factors.
(3) Proposing TSRDet to address limitations by refactoring multi-label problem, tuning RPN ratios, applying deformable convolutions and adding Spatial Attention Module.
(4) State-of-the-art results on datasets like SciTSR, FinTabNet and PubTabs1M for both detection and cell-level metrics, improving Cascade R-CNN baseline by 11-19\%.

In summary, the paper provides valuable analysis and improvements for detection-based TSR. TSRDet outperforms other detection and non-detection methods by addressing key limitations.
