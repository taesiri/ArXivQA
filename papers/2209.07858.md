# [Red Teaming Language Models to Reduce Harms: Methods, Scaling Behaviors,   and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07858)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to have a single focused research question or hypothesis. Instead, it appears to make the following main contributions:

1. It investigates scaling behaviors for "red teaming" language models of different sizes (2.7B, 13B, 52B parameters) and with different safety interventions (unprompted, prompted to be helpful/honest/harmless, rejection sampling, reinforcement learning). 

2. It releases a dataset of ~39K red team attacks for the research community to analyze harms in language models. The authors provide some analysis of their data.

3. It documents the instructions, processes, and methodologies used for red teaming in detail, in hopes that transparency will help the research community develop shared norms and best practices around red teaming language models.

So in summary, this paper takes an empirical approach to red teaming several language models, releases the dataset, analyzes it, and reflects on the process. The goal seems to be furthering transparency, releasing data, and developing best practices - rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The main findings are around scaling trends and the landscape of possible harms uncovered via red teaming.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on red teaming AI systems:

- The paper focuses on red teaming large language models, including models up to 52 billion parameters. This allows the authors to study how model scale impacts susceptibility to harmful outputs. Other work has typically focused on smaller models, like the BAD dataset which tested models up to 2.7B parameters.

- The paper explores different safety interventions like prompting, rejection sampling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RLHF seems particularly promising - it becomes much harder to red team as model size increases. Other papers have focused more narrowly on a single intervention. 

- The paper releases a large dataset of ~40K red team attacks. Other publicly available red team datasets are much smaller, like the BAD dataset of ~5K conversations. The scale allows more detailed analysis of the types of harms uncovered.

- The authors use both quantitative metrics like harmfulness scores and qualitative analysis like tagging samples of the data. This provides a more complete picture compared to just using one method. Other papers tend to focus more narrowly on just quantitative or qualitative analysis.

- The paper is transparent about methods and limitations. The authors discuss challenges like low inter-annotator agreement on harmfulness ratings. They also highlight crowdworker biases and data incompleteness as limitations. This level of reflexivity is important but not always present in similar papers.

- The policy discussion on norms for red teaming and releasing findings is unique. Most papers in this field do not consider policy implications in that level of detail.

So in summary, the scale of models tested, the multi-faceted analysis, transparency about limitations, and policy discussion help advance the field and differentiate this paper from related work on red teaming AI systems. The release of the large dataset is also an important contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Comparing manual vs automated red teaming methods. The authors mention that recent work has explored automating red teaming using language models, and they suggest comparing manual and automated approaches systematically to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each.

- Exploring different instructions and information given to the red team. The authors note they were unsure how much guidance to provide the red team members, and suggest experimenting with different levels of prescriptiveness to encourage creativity while still covering important vulnerabilities.

- Combining top-down and bottom-up strategies for data analysis. The authors suggest starting with an existing taxonomy of possible harms, but also leaving room for discovery of new types of attacks not covered in the taxonomy.

- Red teaming with domain experts. The authors note some attacks seemed to require special expertise to evaluate, so suggest recruiting experts in certain domains to red team systems.

- Documenting informal red teaming results. The authors mention informally uncovering additional issues not present in the dataset, and suggest documenting these qualitative safety failures in future work.

- Studying the psychological effects of red teaming. The authors express concerns about potential harm to red team members, and suggest further analyzing the well-being of participants.

- Developing shared norms around red teaming and releasing findings. The authors recommend bringing together stakeholders to build consensus on best practices for red teaming and appropriately releasing results.

In summary, the key directions focus on improving red teaming methods, expanding analysis of the types of harms uncovered, mitigating risks to red team members, and promoting coordination around red teaming and transparency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper describes efforts by researchers at Anthropic to "red team" large language models in order to discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially harmful outputs. The main contributions are:

1. Investigating scaling behaviors for red teaming across different model sizes and types. They find that models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) become harder to red team as they scale up in size. The other model types show no clear trend.  

2. Releasing a dataset of over 38,000 red team attacks for the community to analyze and learn from. The authors provide some analysis of the harms uncovered and find a range including offensive language, subtly harmful unethical behavior, and more.

3. Providing a detailed description of their red teaming instructions, processes, statistical methods, and lessons learned. The goal is to accelerate the development of shared norms, practices, and standards for red teaming language models.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous empirical analysis of red teaming approaches across models of varying sizes and safety interventions. By open-sourcing their dataset and documenting their process in detail, the authors aim to promote more transparent and collaborative approaches to red teaming and safety in AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper describes early efforts by researchers at Anthropic to manually red team language models in order to simultaneously discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially harmful outputs. The authors make three main contributions:

1) They investigate scaling behaviors for red teaming across model sizes and types, finding that models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) become harder to red team at scale, while other models show flat trends. 

2) They release a dataset of ~39,000 red team attacks for others to analyze, providing analysis of the types of harms uncovered.

3) They extensively detail their red team instructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainties to accelerate community efforts around shared norms and best practices for red teaming language models. Overall, this transparent paper aims to advance safety research through released data and detailed methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper describes efforts by researchers at Anthropic to red team language models in order to simultaneously discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially harmful outputs. The researchers investigate scaling behaviors for red teaming across 3 model sizes (2.7B, 13B, and 52B parameters) and 4 model types. They find that models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are increasingly difficult to red team as they scale, while other model types exhibit a flat trend with scale. The researchers also release a dataset of 38,961 red team attacks for analysis. They provide their own analysis and find the attacks cover a variety of harmful outputs including offensive language and subtle unethical outputs. Finally, the researchers extensively describe their instructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainty about red teaming, with the hope of accelerating the development of shared norms and practices for red teaming language models.

In summary, the key contributions are:
1) Investigating scaling laws for red teaming across different model sizes and types.
2) Releasing a dataset of red team attacks for further analysis.  
3) Providing transparency into their processes and statistical techniques for red teaming language models.

The researchers aim to work towards developing shared standards for red teaming language models through releasing their dataset and detailing their methodology.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper describes an approach for "red teaming" large language models in order to simultaneously discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially harmful outputs. The authors have human crowdworkers engage in adversarial dialogues with AI assistants powered by language models ranging in size from 2.7B to 52B parameters. The authors consider four model types: a plain language model, a language model prompted to be helpful/honest/harmless, a language model with rejection sampling, and a language model trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to maximize harmlessness scores from a preference model. After each dialogue turn, crowdworkers label which of two model responses is more harmful, allowing the authors to quantify the harmfulness of responses. The authors analyze results across model sizes and types to determine scaling trends and release a dataset of ~39K attacks for the community to build on. They also provide an analysis of the types of harms uncovered.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the potential harms and risks of large language models, and describes an approach to "red teaming" these models in order to discover, measure, and attempt to reduce harmful outputs. The three main contributions of the paper are:

1. Investigating scaling behaviors for red teaming across different model sizes and types. They find that RLHF models are harder to red team as they scale up in size, while other models show flat trends. 

2. Releasing a dataset of ~39,000 red team attacks for the research community to analyze and learn from. The authors analyze this data themselves and find a variety of harmful outputs ranging from offensive language to subtle unethical behaviors.

3. Providing a detailed description of their red teaming instructions, processes, statistical methods, and uncertainties. This transparency is intended to help the research community develop shared norms and best practices around red teaming language models.

The key goal is to use red teaming to make progress towards safer, more aligned language models by discovering failures through adversarial attacks, then using this data to improve the models. The paper also reflects thoughtfully on the challenges and limitations of manual red teaming, and proposes some policy interventions to facilitate more openness and coordination as a research community.

 Based on a review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Red teaming - The paper focuses on using manual "red teaming" methods to probe language models for harmful outputs. Red teaming refers to the practice of having a group challenge an organization's security or safety by acting as adversaries.

- Language models - The paper examines red teaming applied to large language models, specifically models ranging from 2.7B to 52B parameters. Language models are trained to predict the next word(s) in a sequence. 

- Scaling laws - One contribution is investigating how susceptibility to red teaming changes as language models scale up in size. The paper examines scaling behaviors across different model sizes and types.

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - One of the model types tested uses RLHF to train the model to be helpful and harmless based on human preference data. The paper finds this technique makes models harder to red team.

- Safety interventions - In addition to RLHF, other safety interventions analyzed include prompting models to be helpful/honest/harmless and using rejection sampling.

- Dataset release - 38,961 red team attacks are released for further analysis and to prototype harm mitigation methods.
