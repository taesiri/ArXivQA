## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder marked by seizures. Timely detection and prediction of seizures is crucial for reducing patient injury and enabling prompt treatment. 
- Existing deep learning models for EEG-based seizure analysis are computationally expensive, making embedded implementations difficult.

Proposed Solution:

- Leverages sparsity in spiking neural networks for energy-efficient processing using a proposed approximate spiking neuron layer. This layer omits unnecessary spike-triggered updates in inactive neurons, reducing computations by ~38% without affecting accuracy.
- Evaluated on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. For seizure detection, achieved 94.9% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. For seizure prediction, achieved 96.8% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity.
- Compared to non-spiking equivalent, the Spiking Conformer provides >10x reduction in operations. Showcases potential for advancing epilepsy monitoring applications on embedded, low-power devices.
- State-of-the-art results for raw EEG-based seizure prediction. Comparable performance to other works while using fewer parameters and timesteps.

In summary, the key innovation is the energy-efficient Spiking Conformer for accurate EEG classification leveraging sparsity. The model delivers promising results on seizure detection and prediction using raw signals, with reduced computations suitable for low-power implementation.
