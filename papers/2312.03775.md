# [FAAC: Facial Animation Generation with Anchor Frame and Conditional   Control for Superior Fidelity and Editability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating high-quality facial animations is challenging due to issues with realism, fidelity, consistency across frames, controllability of motions, and editability. 
- Existing methods like Deepfakes have limited expressiveness and creativity. Diffusion models are promising but incorporating temporal dynamics can degrade image quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce concept of "anchor frame" to maintain fidelity of a reference frame generated solely from the text-to-image (T2I) model.  
- Propose two anchor frame strategies: training-free and training-based. Both help model consistency to the anchor frame during training.
- Incorporate conditional control signals from a 3D morphable face model to enable more accurate and controllable capture of facial motions.

Key Contributions:
- Anchor frame inference methods to preserve fidelity and editability compared to just inserting motion modules into T2I models.
- Conditional control with 3D morphable models for better motion capture.
- Combined conditional control generation and long sequence video generation.
- Validation of approach through improved quantitative metrics (fidelity, editability, video quality) compared to baseline method on multiple DreamBooth and LoRA models.

In summary, the paper introduces novel techniques to generate high-quality and controllable facial animations using diffusion models, while overcoming common challenges faced by prior arts through the strategic use of anchor frames and 3D morphable face representations. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
