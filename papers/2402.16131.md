# [A VAE-based Framework for Learning Multi-Level Neural Granger-Causal   Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of estimating Granger causal relationships amongst variables in a collection of related dynamical systems. Specifically, given multivariate time series data capturing the temporal dynamics of a set of variables (nodes) for multiple related dynamical systems (entities), the goal is to jointly estimate the Granger causal connectivity patterns that are shared across entities (group-level) as well as the idiosyncratic ones for each entity (entity-level). This allows simultaneously extracting the common structure and identifying heterogeneity across entities.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a variational autoencoder (VAE) based framework with a hierarchical structure to address the problem. The framework comprises of:

- A generative model that couples the group-level and entity-level Granger causal graphs through a hierarchy. The model assumes the graphs are latent variables that dictate the dynamics of the observed multivariate time series.  

- An inference model in the form of a VAE encoder-decoder that enables end-to-end learning of the generative model. The encoder infers the latent graphs based on the observed data, while the decoder reconstructs the time series conditioned on the sampled graphs.

- The encoder-decoder modules leverage distributions that form conjugate pairs to facilitate computations and inference. The framework can handle both continuous and binary Granger causal graphs.

- A weighted conjugacy adjustment mechanism that merges information from the encoder and decoder distributions. This allows controllable infusion of heterogeneity during the decoding process.

Main Contributions:

- A flexible VAE-based framework that can jointly estimate group and entity-level Granger causal structures by modeling them as hierarchically coupled latent variables.

- The ability to simultaneously extract shared and idiosyncratic connectivity patterns without needing ad-hoc aggregation schemes.  

- Applicability to settings with vector-valued time series and those where connectivity is either continuous or binary.

- Robustness to sample sizes for estimating the group-level graph, and advantages over individual entity learning when sample sizes become smaller.

- Demonstrated performance improvement over existing methods designed for single entity analysis, in several synthetic data experiments and one real application.
