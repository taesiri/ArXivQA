# [Improving Interpretable Embeddings for Ad-hoc Video Search with   Generative Captions and Multi-word Concept Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Ad-hoc video search (AVS) aims to retrieve relevant videos given a free-form textual query. Two mainstream approaches exist - concept-based search and embedding-based search. However, they suffer from two key issues:
   1) Small dataset size limits learning robust alignments between texts and videos.  
   2) Word-only concept banks have limited ability to model relationships between query words, leading to out-of-vocabulary issues.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a new large-scale text-video dataset (WebVid-genCap7M) with 7M automatically generated text-video pairs to pretrain retrieval models. 
- Develop a multi-word concept bank incorporating noun, verb, adjective, prepositional and quantifier phrases based on syntactic analysis to better model query word relationships.  
- Enhance textual and visual encoders with recent transformer models like CLIP, BLIP-2 and imagebind.

These components are integrated into a state-of-the-art interpretable embedding model called ITV. 

Main Contributions:
- WebVid-genCap7M dataset with 7M text-video pairs improves embedding search by providing more training data, especially for unseen queries.
- Multi-word concept bank boosts concept search, doubling performance on out-of-vocabulary queries by better modeling query relationships.
- Advanced visual features consistently improve retrieval over textual features.
- Combination of the above components sets new state-of-the-art on MSRVTT dataset and improves performance over prior approaches on 8 years of TRECVID datasets by a large margin.
- Provides generalizable techniques to address dataset size and out-of-vocabulary issues for video retrieval.

In summary, the paper presents three complementary techniques to enhance an interpretable embedding model for ad-hoc video search, achieving new state-of-the-art retrieval performance. The WebVid-genCap7M dataset and multi-word concept bank specifically target limitations of small dataset size and modeling query relationships respectively.
