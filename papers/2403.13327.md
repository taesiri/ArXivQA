# [Gaussian Splatting on the Move: Blur and Rolling Shutter Compensation   for Natural Camera Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
High-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) require high-quality still photographs that are accurately registered. However, capturing such data with handheld cameras inevitably leads to motion blur and rolling shutter distortion, degrading reconstruction quality. Existing deblurring methods operate on images, without modeling the underlying 3D scene. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a method to adapt 3DGS to camera motion and enable high-quality reconstruction from blurry, rolling-shutter distorted video from handheld devices. The key ideas are:

1) Model motion blur and rolling shutter as dynamic 3D effects caused by continuous camera motion during exposure. Camera poses and velocities from visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are used.

2) Implement an efficient differentiable rendering pipeline incorporating these effects via a screen space approximation focused on adjusting Gaussian means over time.

3) Further regularize using techniques like underestimating exposure time and adding noise to velocities.

4) Optimize poses within 3DGS using approximate gradients to integrate VIO information.

Contributions:

- Formulation and efficient implementation of motion blur and rolling shutter effects in the 3DGS differential rendering framework without additional learnable parameters.

- Demonstrated improvements in reconstruction quality, both numerically and visually, over baselines on synthetic and real smartphone data in terms of PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS.

- Enabled high-quality 3DGS reconstruction from casually-captured handheld data, advancing applicability of the framework to naturalistic settings.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to compensate for dynamic image effects using approximate differentiation of an underlying 3D scene representation. This allows sharper and more accurate novel view synthesis from casually-captured handheld footage.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method to adapt Gaussian Splatting for high quality 3D scene reconstruction from handheld video suffering from motion blur and rolling shutter distortion by modeling the physical image formation process and utilizing visual-inertial odometry for velocity estimates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a method to adapt Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-quality scene reconstruction from handheld video data suffering from motion blur and rolling shutter distortion. Specifically:

- They formulate an efficient differentiable motion blur and rolling-shutter capable rendering pipeline for 3DGS that utilizes screen space approximation and pixel velocity-based rasterization. This avoids recomputing or hindering the performance of core 3DGS operations when incorporating motion effects.

- They model the image formation process directly using camera velocities estimated from visual-inertial odometry (VIO), instead of learning blur kernels or manipulating the training images. 

- They incorporate regularization strategies and priors from sensor data to reduce artifacts and increase quality.

- They demonstrate superior performance over existing methods on both synthetic and real smartphone data in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing 3DGS to work effectively on casual handheld video data by compensating for motion blur and rolling shutter distortions through modifications to the differentiable rendering pipeline itself. This expands the applicability of 3DGS to more naturalistic capture conditions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method model motion blur and rolling shutter effects as continuous 3D effects caused by camera motion along a trajectory? What assumptions does it make about the camera trajectory over time?

2. Explain the screen space approximation approach and how it captures the effects of camera motion into the pixel coordinates. Why is this useful compared to treating the effects in world coordinates?

3. The pixel velocities formula incorporates linear and angular velocity from visual-inertial odometry. Walk through the full derivation of this formula. What approximations are made?

4. Explain how the method handles differentiation with respect to camera pose parameters. Why is it beneficial to approximate the derivatives in terms of Gaussian position derivatives?

6. What is the rationale behind using velocity regularization and underestimating exposure time as additional regularization methods? How could the velocity estimates be further refined?

7. Analyze the results on synthetic and real data. Why does the method perform well on synthetic data but more mixed on real data? Where are areas for improvement?

8. Compare and contrast the proposed approach to other methods like Deblur-NeRF and BAD-NeRF. What are the tradeoffs? When would you choose one over the other?

9. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real data. Discuss the modifications made to the Deblur-NeRF dataset. Why were these necessary?
