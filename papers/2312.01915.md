## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called BiT (Bidirectional Transition) to extract reliable and generalizable representations from vision-based observations in reinforcement learning. The key idea is to leverage both forward and backward transition predictions of the environment as auxiliary tasks during representation learning. This aligns with human intuition - when we can successfully predict both future states and trace back history based on current observations, it indicates we truly comprehend the current state. Concretely, BiT contains a feature extractor and a bidirectional transition learner with three modules - forward transition, backward transition, and action prediction. By jointly optimizing the prediction objectives, the learned representation encapsulates rich environmental context and provides dependable support for downstream policy learning, enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments on DMControl, robotic manipulation and driving simulations demonstrate BiT's superior performance over prior state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization capability and sample efficiency. The results exhibit BiT's wide applicability for vision-based reinforcement learning.
