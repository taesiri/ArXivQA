# [CREMA: Multimodal Compositional Video Reasoning via Efficient Modular   Adaptation and Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Despite impressive progress in multimodal compositional reasoning models, they still face critical limitations in flexibility and efficiency. Specifically, they typically process fixed sets of modalities (e.g. only vision and language) while updating a lot of model parameters. This makes adapting these models to new modalities like audio or 3D very costly and complex.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes CREMA, an efficient and modular framework for multimodal compositional video reasoning. CREMA can easily incorporate new modalities like video frames, audio, depth maps, point clouds etc. into an existing vision-language model using only a small number of additional parameters (<5M per modality). 

It achieves this via 1) Modality-specific adapters on top of a universal Q-Former module to extract informative features from each modality 2) A fusion module to selectively combine multimodal features while keeping token sizes small.

Main Contributions:

1) Highly parameter-efficient modality adapters to flexibly integrate new data types into video reasoning models  

2) Modular framework design that sustains previously added modalities while upgrading with new modalities or language models

3) Novel self-gated fusion technique to compress multimodal queries for efficiency

4) Demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple compositional QA benchmarks using only ~2-4% parameters of comparison models

In summary, CREMA provides an efficient, flexible and accurate approach to multimodal video reasoning by introducing adaptable modality fusion into model architectures. Key advantages are easy extensibility to new modalities and compact fusion of multimodal signals for enhanced reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CREMA, an efficient and modular multimodal video reasoning framework that can incorporate new modalities like video, audio, and 3D inputs using a parameter-efficient Query Transformer with adapters, outperforming prior methods while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are four-fold:

1. It proposes CREMA, a highly efficient and generalizable modality-extensible learning framework for video reasoning that can easily embrace new modalities like video, optical flow, audio, 3D point cloud, etc. using parameter-efficient adapters.

2. CREMA's design allows easy addition of new modalities by adding lightweight modality-adaptive modules without needing to modify the existing framework.

3. It presents a trainable modality fusion module that efficiently weighs modalities, integrating useful modality features into response generation. 

4. It demonstrates CREMA's efficacy on multiple video reasoning datasets, achieving better or equivalent performance compared to models like BLIP-2, 3D-LLM and SeViLA while using about 96% fewer trainable parameters.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing an efficient and modular video reasoning framework that can flexibly adapt to new modalities, along with a fusion module to selectively integrate useful modalities, validated on multiple benchmarks.
