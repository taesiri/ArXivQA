## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image inpainting aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted parts of images based on the surrounding available pixels. Existing methods have limitations in effectively modeling long-range dependencies to generate high-quality and coherent results, especially for images with large missing regions where available information is very limited. 

Key Limitations of Existing Methods:
1) CNN-based methods with local convolutions fail to capture long-range spatial relations. 
2) Methods adding spatial self-attention are computationally expensive, making them infeasible for high-resolution images.
3) Downsampling images leads to loss of valid information from available regions, degrading quality.
4) Simply using pixel shuffle for corrupted images causes drifts in invalid pixel positions across channels during downsampling.

Proposed Solution - High-quality Inpainting Transformer (HINT):
1) Mask-Aware Pixel Shuffle Downsampling (MPD): A new downsampling approach tailored for image inpainting to keep invalid pixel positions consistent across channels.

2) Spatially-Activated Channel Attention Layer (SCAL): Efficiently models long-range dependencies in channel dimension while retaining spatial awareness of where salient features are located.

3) Sandwich-Shaped Transformer Block: Encapsulates SCAL between two Feedforward Networks to filter features and boost SCAL's effectiveness with limited parameters.

Overall, HINT takes advantage of multi-scale spatial, channel and pixel level information in an end-to-end architecture to effectively preserve and model global context for reconstructing high-quality coherent images.

Main Contributions:
1) MPD for consistent downsampling in image inpainting
2) SCAL for efficient spatial-channel attention 
3) Sandwich transformer block improving SCAL
4) State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance across datasets
