# [DeepCache: Accelerating Diffusion Models for Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DeepCache: Accelerating Diffusion Models for Free":

Problem:
Diffusion models have shown impressive results for generative image modeling. However, their inference process is slow due to the sequential denoising over multiple steps. Existing methods accelerate diffusion models by reducing steps or shrinking model size, but they require extensive retraining. 

Key Idea:
The paper proposes DeepCache, a training-free approach to accelerate diffusion models by caching and reusing features between denoising steps. It is based on two key observations:

1) Adjacent denoising steps exhibit significant temporal feature similarity, especially at high levels, indicating redundant computations.

2) UNet has separate pathways for high-level and low-level features that can be processed separately.

Approach: 
DeepCache caches the high-level features from the UNet's main branch after each full inference step. For subsequent steps, it avoids recomputing the main branch and only computes the shallow skip branch, retrieving the cached high-level features from previous steps. This partial inference reduces computations while maintaining precision using cached features.

DeepCache supports both uniform 1:N inference over N steps and non-uniform inference centered on low-similarity steps. It is compatible with sampling techniques like DDIM and PLMS for further acceleration.

Contributions:
- Proposes DeepCache as the first training-free approach to accelerate diffusion models by caching redundant features between steps.

- Achieves up to 2.3x speedup for Stable Diffusion and 7x for LDM with minimal quality loss, outperforming pruning and distillation methods.

- Demonstrates compatibility with fast sampling techniques for further improvements.

- Provides extensive analysis - ablation studies validate caching and partial inference, evolution studies show graceful quality degradation with more caching.

In summary, DeepCache offers a fresh perspective for accelerating diffusion models without retraining by exploiting temporal feature redundancy. Its effectiveness across models and techniques highlights caching as a promising approach for efficient generative modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

DeepCache is a novel training-free paradigm that accelerates diffusion models by caching and reusing high-level features across adjacent denoising steps to avoid redundant computations, achieving up to 10x speedup while maintaining generation quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing DeepCache, a novel training-free paradigm to accelerate diffusion models by exploiting the temporal redundancy in high-level features between consecutive denoising steps. Specifically, DeepCache caches the high-level features which exhibit minimal change over time, and reuses them in subsequent steps to avoid redundant computations. This is achieved by leveraging the U-Net architecture to cache the features from the main branch and only update the low-level features from the skip connections. Experiments show DeepCache can accelerate models like Stable Diffusion and LDM by over 2x without additional training or decline in image quality. Key benefits highlighted include superior performance compared to pruning and distillation methods needing retraining, compatibility with sampling techniques like DDIM and PLMS, and the ability to tradeoff speed and quality by adjusting the caching interval.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Diffusion models - The paper focuses on accelerating inference in diffusion models for image generation. This includes models like DDPM, LDM, Stable Diffusion.

- Denoising process - The diffusion models work by adding noise to data and then denoising it in a sequential process. The paper aims to optimize this.  

- Temporal redundancy - The paper observes temporal redundancy or similarity in features between consecutive denoising steps. This redundancy is leveraged.

- DeepCache - This is the method proposed in the paper to accelerate diffusion models by caching and reusing features between steps.

- U-Net architecture - The diffusion models are based on a U-Net which has skip connections. These are utilized in DeepCache.

- Feature caching - Storing and retrieving features between steps instead of recomputing, enabled by temporal redundancy.

- Training-free acceleration - A key aspect is accelerating diffusion models without needing to retrain or fine-tune the model.

- Layer removal - Partial inference is done by removing certain layers in the U-Net during retrieval steps.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around efficiently accelerating inference in diffusion models by exploiting temporal feature redundancy without retraining.
