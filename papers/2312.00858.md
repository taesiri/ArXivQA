# [DeepCache: Accelerating Diffusion Models for Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DeepCache: Accelerating Diffusion Models for Free":

Problem:
Diffusion models have shown impressive results for generative image modeling. However, their inference process is slow due to the sequential denoising over multiple steps. Existing methods accelerate diffusion models by reducing steps or shrinking model size, but they require extensive retraining. 

Key Idea:
The paper proposes DeepCache, a training-free approach to accelerate diffusion models by caching and reusing features between denoising steps. It is based on two key observations:

1) Adjacent denoising steps exhibit significant temporal feature similarity, especially at high levels, indicating redundant computations.

2) UNet has separate pathways for high-level and low-level features that can be processed separately.

Approach: 
DeepCache caches the high-level features from the UNet's main branch after each full inference step. For subsequent steps, it avoids recomputing the main branch and only computes the shallow skip branch, retrieving the cached high-level features from previous steps. This partial inference reduces computations while maintaining precision using cached features.

DeepCache supports both uniform 1:N inference over N steps and non-uniform inference centered on low-similarity steps. It is compatible with sampling techniques like DDIM and PLMS for further acceleration.

Contributions:
- Proposes DeepCache as the first training-free approach to accelerate diffusion models by caching redundant features between steps.

- Achieves up to 2.3x speedup for Stable Diffusion and 7x for LDM with minimal quality loss, outperforming pruning and distillation methods.

- Demonstrates compatibility with fast sampling techniques for further improvements.

- Provides extensive analysis - ablation studies validate caching and partial inference, evolution studies show graceful quality degradation with more caching.

In summary, DeepCache offers a fresh perspective for accelerating diffusion models without retraining by exploiting temporal feature redundancy. Its effectiveness across models and techniques highlights caching as a promising approach for efficient generative modeling.
