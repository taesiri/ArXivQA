# [A Survey on Extractive Knowledge Graph Summarization: Applications,   Approaches, Evaluation, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the continuous growth of large knowledge graphs (KGs), it has become challenging for humans and machines to efficiently process and reuse them. Extractive KG summarization aims to address this by distilling a compact yet informative subgraph from a large KG. Such an extractive summary facilitates various downstream applications such as KG search, exploration, and reuse. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper provides the first comprehensive survey on extractive KG summarization. It reviews the applications, approaches, evaluation methods, and future directions of this emerging research area.

The paper categorizes extractive KG summaries into static and dynamic ones. Static summaries reflect the intrinsic characteristics of a KG and are used for KG profiling and query optimization. Dynamic summaries are customized to users' information needs expressed as keyword queries or interests, and are useful for KG search, exploration and reuse.

A taxonomy is presented to organize existing approaches into pattern coverage-based and answer coverage-based methods for static summary extraction, and query-biased and personalized methods for dynamic summary extraction. Advanced techniques adopt formulations based on maximum coverage, group Steiner trees, etc. to optimize structural compactness, query relevance, and semantic cohesiveness. 

Since it is difficult to manually create gold standard summaries, extractive methods are evaluated by quality metrics measuring the coverage of KG elements, user studies rating summary quality, and extrinsic evaluations testing performance in downstream tasks. Time efficiency is also an important factor.

Main Contributions:
- Provides the first comprehensive survey on extractive KG summarization
- Reviews applications, approaches, evaluation methods, and future directions
- Categorizes extractive summaries and organizes extraction methods into a taxonomy
- Covers advanced techniques based on combinatorial optimization formulations
- Discusses quality metrics, user studies, extrinsic evaluations for method assessment
- Highlights underexplored future directions such as neural, supervised, generative, and collaborative extraction

The survey offers useful guidelines for researchers and practitioners to understand the state-of-the-art and choose appropriate methods for extractive KG summarization in different application scenarios.
