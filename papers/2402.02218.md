# [Machine Intelligence in Africa: a survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This comprehensive survey paper explores the landscape of machine intelligence (MI) research and implementation across Africa from 2000-2023. It aims to shed light on the diverse paths undertaken by each African country in embracing MI and highlight opportunities alongside key challenges.  

The paper reveals that while some countries have explicit national MI strategies, high-profile meetings in expensive venues often have little real-world impact. Moreover, an examination of over 400 MI research articles on Africa shows that most applications are at a preliminary testing level using limited datasets and basic algorithms. There is frequently an overstatement of capabilities.

The paper argues that using uniform country rankings for MI adoption is unethical, as it fails to account for transparency, on-the-ground actions, and impact on local populations. 

It provides an extensive overview of MI activities spanning domains like healthcare, agriculture, art, governance, and the informal economy across Africa's five regions: North, South, Central, West, and East Africa. 

The paper emphasizes that human learning is much more central than machine learning in the surveyed works, with people utilizing technology tools alongside natural inspiration. It highlights the untapped potential of audio literacy in local languages to empower inclusion.

The paper also examines limitations in using universal frameworks like UTAUT for technology adoption. It proposes adapting evaluation approaches to the specific complexities of each African country through ethical, multimodal assessments rather than generalized rankings.

Overall, this paper contributes significantly to understanding MI landscape in Africa, revealing key opportunities alongside ethical and practical challenges involved in developing impactful, culturally-aligned solutions tailored to local contexts. The findings advocate for increased transparency, inclusion, and meaningfully addressing real-world needs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This survey article presents the current status and some notable advancements in machine intelligence research, industry applications, government initiatives, and use cases spanning diverse sectors across the 54 African countries, while also calling for localized, ethical, and culturally-sensitive approaches adapted to unique African contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey of machine intelligence research, applications, and strategies across African countries. Its main contributions include:

1) Reviewing over 400 research articles on MI use cases across Africa, revealing that many applications are at an early testing level and that findings are often oversold. It calls for using more practical MI algorithms. 

2) Highlighting the disparity between high-profile MI meetings/reports and their actual local impact, emphasizing the need for inclusive strategies with concrete government actions beyond speeches.

3) Arguing that current MI country rankings and indexes are unethical, as they lack data transparency, concrete actions, and local population benefit considerations. 

4) Presenting a breakdown of MI activities across 5 African regions and 54 countries, spanning research, industry, government initiatives, art/music, and small businesses.

5) Discussing limitations of universal technology adoption models like UTAUT for Africa and proposing game theory and co-opetitive mean-field-type game theory as better alternatives.  

6) Introducing a multi-scale, multi-layer framework for MI ethics in Africa involving various stakeholders.

7) Underscoring Africa's rich audio literacy and the need to harness it in inclusive, culturally-aware MI that bridges language barriers.

In summary, it provides a critique of current practices and an updated, nuanced perspective on opportunities and challenges for MI aligned with African contexts.

It also touches on pressing issues around MI metrics, indexes, ethics and data in the African context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a multiscale framework for machine intelligence ethics in Africa with 7 key dimensions (individual, cultures, institutions, nation, platforms, globally, over time). How does considering ethics across these different scales lead to a more comprehensive understanding compared to a single universal ethical code?

2) The paper argues that current machine intelligence indexes for ranking countries are unethical. What are some of the key limitations identified in using such indexes to assess machine intelligence progress, particularly in the African context?

3) The paper introduces a concept called "machine intelligence integrity" which involves embedding ethical assessments into the core functioning of machine intelligence systems. How does this differ from standard ethical guidelines and what are the benefits of this approach?  

4) What is the difference between the proposed "state-and-mean-field-type feedback strategy" compared to traditional state-feedback and open-loop strategies in dynamic game theory? How does this strategy help address ethical considerations in machine intelligence?

5) The paper proposes a co-opetitive mean-field-type game theory approach for machine intelligence in Africa. How does this framework, which combines cooperation and competition elements, better capture the real-world dynamics compared to traditional competition models?  

6) How does the multimodal ethics framework proposed in the paper, with its different scales and ethics focus areas, aim to provide a more interconnected understanding of machine intelligence ethics in the African context?

7) What are some of the key practical limitations identified in the paper when it comes to applying universal machine intelligence ethical guidelines to informal sectors in the African context?

8) The paper argues that current practices around machine intelligence ethics in Africa are unethical. What evidence or examples does it provide to support this argument?  

9) What kinds of concrete actions or recommendations does the paper propose when it comes to ethical and culturally sensitive development of machine intelligence systems in Africa?

10) How does the concept of "audio literacy" and direct audio-to-audio processing relate to promoting more inclusive machine intelligence practices that cater to local African languages and contexts?
