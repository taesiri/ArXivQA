# [Machine Intelligence in Africa: a survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This comprehensive survey paper explores the landscape of machine intelligence (MI) research and implementation across Africa from 2000-2023. It aims to shed light on the diverse paths undertaken by each African country in embracing MI and highlight opportunities alongside key challenges.  

The paper reveals that while some countries have explicit national MI strategies, high-profile meetings in expensive venues often have little real-world impact. Moreover, an examination of over 400 MI research articles on Africa shows that most applications are at a preliminary testing level using limited datasets and basic algorithms. There is frequently an overstatement of capabilities.

The paper argues that using uniform country rankings for MI adoption is unethical, as it fails to account for transparency, on-the-ground actions, and impact on local populations. 

It provides an extensive overview of MI activities spanning domains like healthcare, agriculture, art, governance, and the informal economy across Africa's five regions: North, South, Central, West, and East Africa. 

The paper emphasizes that human learning is much more central than machine learning in the surveyed works, with people utilizing technology tools alongside natural inspiration. It highlights the untapped potential of audio literacy in local languages to empower inclusion.

The paper also examines limitations in using universal frameworks like UTAUT for technology adoption. It proposes adapting evaluation approaches to the specific complexities of each African country through ethical, multimodal assessments rather than generalized rankings.

Overall, this paper contributes significantly to understanding MI landscape in Africa, revealing key opportunities alongside ethical and practical challenges involved in developing impactful, culturally-aligned solutions tailored to local contexts. The findings advocate for increased transparency, inclusion, and meaningfully addressing real-world needs.
