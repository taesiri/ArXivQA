# [Addressing Membership Inference Attack in Federated Learning with Model   Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17750)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes MaPP-FL, a novel model-agnostic federated learning (FL) approach that leverages model compression on the clients while keeping a full model on the server. MaPP-FL is designed to enhance privacy in FL systems. Through an analysis on benchmark vision datasets, the authors show that the effectiveness of membership inference attacks negatively correlates with client dataset size and model complexity. To mitigate such privacy risks, MaPP-FL allows clients to train smaller models than the server while still benefitting from a shared global model. Specifically, MaPP-FL creates channel groups where client models are restricted to subsets of channels from the server model. Experiments across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that MaPP-FL achieves competitive accuracy while preserving better privacy than state-of-the-art methods. The privacy-accuracy trade-off is attributed to MaPP-FL striking a balance between the privacy benefits of randomness (like Federated Dropout) and the performance benefits of structural model considerations (like HeteroFL). Overall, MaPP-FL advances model-agnostic FL as an effective approach for enhancing privacy without sacrificing utility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MaPP-FL, a novel privacy-preserving federated learning approach that leverages model compression on the clients while keeping a full model on the server to address membership inference attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing MaPP-FL, a novel approach to federated learning that achieves competitive accuracy while preserving privacy. Specifically:

- MaPP-FL is a model-agnostic federated learning method that enables clients to learn models of varying complexity, including smaller and less complex models that are less vulnerable to privacy attacks. 

- The paper analyzes the correlation between model complexity, dataset size, and vulnerability to membership inference attacks. The results show that smaller models trained on less data are significantly less vulnerable. This motivates the model-agnostic approach.

- MaPP-FL allows clients to learn smaller model versions through model compression techniques while keeping a full model on the server side. This preserves accuracy on the server side while enhancing privacy for the clients.

- Experiments on CIFAR and FEMNIST datasets show that MaPP-FL achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off compared to state-of-the-art federated learning methods. Specifically, it attain competitive accuracy while preserving both client and server privacy.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of MaPP-FL, a novel model-agnostic federated learning approach that leverages model compression to enhance privacy while maintaining accuracy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed MaPP-FL method balance privacy protection and model performance compared to prior federated learning techniques like FedAvg, FedDropout, and HeteroFL? What is the intuition behind the tradeoffs it makes?

2. The paper argues that model complexity correlates with vulnerability to membership inference attacks. How does MaPP-FL's use of model compression help mitigate this while retaining accuracy? 

3. What are the differences between the channel selection strategies used in MaPP-FL versus FedDropout and HeteroFL? How do things like randomness, structure, and client grouping impact privacy and accuracy?

4. Why is handling input-output channel dependency important when doing model compression in CNNs for federated learning? How does MaPP-FL deal with this compared to prior work? 

5. How does MaPP-FL generalize the channel selection approach used in HeteroFL? What impact does having multiple client groups selecting different channels have on privacy and model convergence?

6. What are the potential limitations of evaluating membership inference attacks using Yeom et al.'s loss-based approach? How could the threat model here be expanded or revised?  

7. The experiments show impressive gains on vision datasets - what adaptations would be needed to apply MaPP-FL to other data modalities like text, speech, medicine, etc?

8. How well would MaPP-FL deal with non-IID, imbalanced, or sparse datasets in the clients? What changes may help improve robustness?

9. How could MaPP-FL be combined with complementary privacy techniques like secure aggregation, differential privacy, or trusted execution environments?

10. What open problems remain in developing privacy-preserving federated learning methods? How might future work build upon MaPP-FL's innovations?
