# [Privacy Profiles for Private Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06701)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Private selection mechanisms like Report Noisy Max and Sparse Vector are important tools for differentially private data analysis and machine learning. 
- Recent work has provided tight privacy analyses of these mechanisms using RÃ©nyi differential privacy (RDP). However, converting RDP guarantees to approximate $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bounds can be loose. 
- There is a need for direct privacy accounting of private selection mechanisms using privacy profiles, i.e. expressing $\delta$ as a function of $\epsilon$. This can lead to tighter overall DP guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- Provides general bounds on the privacy profiles of Report Noisy Max and private hyperparameter tuning algorithms based on the profiles of their base mechanisms.
- Gives distribution-specific bounds for private selection when the number of selection rounds is randomized, e.g. with truncated negative binomial and binomial distributions.
- Bounds based on hockey-stick divergences are simpler and tighter than existing RDP-based analyses.
- Approach allows accurately using state-of-the-art numerical DP accounting methods as building blocks.

Contributions:
- First direct privacy profile analyses of Report Noisy Max and private selection algorithms. 
- Numerical improvements over RDP-based accounting across parameter regimes.
- Enables better end-to-end DP guarantees for applications like differentially private SGD and generalized PTR.
- Suggests new sampling distributions like binomial to concentrate selection rounds.
- Advances the state-of-the-art in the privacy analysis of fundamental DP primitives.

In summary, the paper provides an enhanced analysis of private selection mechanisms using privacy profiles that leads to tighter overall DP guarantees for important applications compared to prior art.
