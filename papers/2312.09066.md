# [CMOSE: Comprehensive Multi-Modality Online Student Engagement Dataset   with High-Quality Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09066)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new dataset called CMOSE for engagement prediction in online learning scenarios. The dataset contains over 12,000 video segments from online presentation training sessions annotated into engagement levels by trained raters based on psychology expert guidance. A multi-modal model is developed combining high-level visual features, deep visual features, and audio features to enhance engagement prediction. Additionally, a new loss function called MocoRank is proposed to handle issues like data imbalance, intra-class variation, and ordinal relationships between engagement levels. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on CMOSE achieve high accuracy and transferability, outperforming models trained on existing datasets DAiSEE and Emotiw. MocoRank also outperforms other state-of-the-art losses. Ultimately, the CMOSE dataset, multi-modal method, and MocoRank training approach push forward the capabilities of engagement prediction for online learning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Engagement detection in online classes is important to improve learning effectiveness. However, there are several challenges in existing datasets and methods:
  - Poor label quality that lacks psychological basis
  - Intra-class variation where students with the same engagement label may have different behaviors
  - Data imbalance where engaged states dominate

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose:

1. CMOSE Dataset:
- Comprises over 12K video segments from online classes with multiple modalities
- Labels are provided by trained raters based on behaviors indicated by psychology experts 
- Contains more diverse disengaged behaviors compared to prior datasets

2. MocoRank Training Mechanism:  
- Uses a momentum encoder and score pool for sampling reference scores
- Employs a multi-margin loss that considers relative order of engagement levels, avoiding a fixed ground truth
- Handles issues of intra-class variation, ordinal relationship and data imbalance  

3. Multi-Modality Feature Combination:
- Combines pre-trained visual features, high-level facial features and audio features 
- Attention mechanism filters irrelevant signals in temporal features
- Audio features further improve performance on segments with speech

Main Contributions:
- Presented the large-scale CMOSE dataset with high quality psychological labels 
- Proposed the MocoRank method to handle multiple challenges in engagement prediction
- Demonstrated benefits of combining multi-modal features for this task
- Showed transferability of CMOSE features to other datasets

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting the CMOSE dataset, which is a comprehensive multi-modal online student engagement dataset with high-quality labels annotated with the advice of psychology experts. It contains sufficient data across different engagement levels.

2. Proposing MocoRank, a training mechanism designed to handle data imbalance, intra-class variation, and ordinal relationships in engagement prediction. Experiments show it outperforms other losses. 

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of combining different levels of visual features (e.g. pretrained video features and high-level facial features) as well as incorporating audio features to improve engagement prediction performance.

4. Analyzing the transferability of the CMOSE dataset by showing models pretrained on it outperform models pretrained on other datasets when evaluated on those datasets. This highlights the quality and diversity of the CMOSE dataset.

In summary, the main contributions are presenting the high-quality CMOSE dataset, the MocoRank training method, using multi-modality features, and demonstrating CMOSE's transferability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new loss function called MocoRank. Can you explain in detail how the Momentum Encoder and Score Pool work in MocoRank? What is the rationale behind using a queue-based score pool?

2. The multi-margin loss in MocoRank considers both the label difference and feature similarity when computing the margin. Can you walk through the calculations for the three margin values M1, M2 and M3? Why is a flexible margin based on cosine similarity useful here?

3. The paper argues that converting the ordinal engagement labels to scalar values for MSE loss is inferior. Can you elaborate why strict ground truth scalars may not accurately capture the engagement levels? How does MocoRank address this issue?  

4. The visual features combine high-level features from OpenFace and spatio-temporal features from I3D. Explain the attention mechanism used and why was it helpful to improve performance?

5. Audio features are incorporated in addition to visual features. Walk through the audio feature extraction process. Why do you think audio features improved performance specifically on video segments with speech?

6. The paper demonstrates the transferability of features learned on CMOSE dataset to other datasets like EmotiW and DAiSEE. What results indicate CMOSE has better transferable features? Why might this be the case?

7. The paper argues CMOSE dataset contains more diversity in behaviors for disengaged states compared to prior datasets. How might this expanded diversity be useful for developing more robust models?

8. What process was used for collecting high-quality labels for the CMOSE dataset? Do you think this labeling process helped improve performance?

9. The paper incorporates information from multiple modalities. What additional modalities could be incorporated in future work to further improve engagement prediction?  

10. The method combines high-level features that are more interpretable with deep visual features. Do you think model interpretability is important for engagement prediction? How can interpretability be improved in future work?
