# [CMOSE: Comprehensive Multi-Modality Online Student Engagement Dataset   with High-Quality Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09066)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new dataset called CMOSE for engagement prediction in online learning scenarios. The dataset contains over 12,000 video segments from online presentation training sessions annotated into engagement levels by trained raters based on psychology expert guidance. A multi-modal model is developed combining high-level visual features, deep visual features, and audio features to enhance engagement prediction. Additionally, a new loss function called MocoRank is proposed to handle issues like data imbalance, intra-class variation, and ordinal relationships between engagement levels. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on CMOSE achieve high accuracy and transferability, outperforming models trained on existing datasets DAiSEE and Emotiw. MocoRank also outperforms other state-of-the-art losses. Ultimately, the CMOSE dataset, multi-modal method, and MocoRank training approach push forward the capabilities of engagement prediction for online learning.
