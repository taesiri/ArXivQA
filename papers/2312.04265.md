# [Stronger, Fewer, &amp; Superior: Harnessing Vision Foundation Models for   Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04265)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper first assesses various Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) including CLIP, MAE, SAM, EVA02, and DINOv2 in the context of Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) by employing them as backbone architectures. The experiments show VFMs achieve significantly better performance compared to previous DGSS methods without any specialized design, demonstrating their powerful generalization capabilities. However, fine-tuning VFMs with all their parameters on smaller datasets results in overfitting, limiting generalizability. Thus the authors propose "Rein", a robust fine-tuning strategy to efficiently harness VFMs for DGSS using fewer trainable parameters. Rein employs random tokens linked to instances to enable instance-level feature refinement through an attention mechanism within each backbone layer. Additional techniques like shared MLP weights and low-rank token matrices further reduce parameters. Extensive experiments on diverse DGSS benchmarks show Rein outperforms state-of-the-art with fewer trainable parameters. For example, Rein achieves 68.1% mIoU on Cityscapes using only 1% extra trainable parameters in DINOv2 backbone, without accessing any real urban datasets during training. The consistent performance gains validate Rein's effectiveness in employing fewer parameters to leverage stronger VFMs for superior generalizability.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to enhance model generalization across unseen domains without accessing their data. However, most prior DGSS methods use outdated backbones like ResNet, leaving the efficacy of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) relatively unexplored.

- Directly fine-tuning VFMs on small datasets leads to limited generalization. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies mainly focus on classification networks and lack precision in handling multiple instances within an image, limiting their effectiveness for segmentation. 

Method - "Rein":
- Proposes a lightweight fine-tuning approach "Rein" to harness VFMs for segmentation using fewer trainable parameters. Rein comprises learnable tokens linked to distinct instances to enable precise instance-level feature refinement within each backbone layer.

- Employs shared MLP weights across layers and generates tokens via low-rank matrices to reduce parameters. Links tokens to instances via dot-product similarity maps and object queries.

Contributions:
- Assesses various VFMs under diverse DGSS settings and shows their superior performance over prior methods, establishing them as a strong benchmark.

- Rein uses 1% extra trainable parameters within frozen VFM backbones, and achieves 68.1% mIoU on Cityscapes without accessing any real urban-scene datasets, significantly outperforming prior arts.

- Achieves consistent segmentation enhancement across multiple VFMs. Can be smoothly integrated as a plug-and-play adapter to existing vision transformers, improving efficiency.
