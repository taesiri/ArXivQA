# [HeadGaS: Real-Time Animatable Head Avatars via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02902)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes HeadGaS, a novel method for real-time animatable 3D head reconstruction and rendering from a monocular input video. The key idea is to represent the 3D head using a set of feature-enhanced 3D Gaussian primitives that can change appearance over time. Specifically, each Gaussian contains a learned latent feature basis that gets blended by expression parameters to yield expression-dependent color and opacity values via a small MLP network. This allows the Gaussians to reveal and hide underlying face structures like teeth dynamically. Combined with an efficient tile-based rasterization algorithm, this representation enables fast optimization and real-time rendering of photo-realistic and controllable head avatars. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that HeadGaS delivers state-of-the-art image quality while accelerating rendering by over 10x compared to recent baselines. It enables compelling applications like same-person expression transfer, cross-subject animation, and free-viewpoint video. Limitations include reliance on accurate head tracking and observations of diverse expressions. Overall, HeadGaS pushes the state-of-the-art in real-time renderable 3D head avatar generation.
