# [Do Large Language Models understand Medical Codes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Medical codes like ICD, CPT, NDC, and LOINC are integral to healthcare systems and are widely used in clinical practice for billing, epidemiology, etc. 
- However, due to limitations in their architectural design and tokenization strategies, large language models (LLMs) may not fully comprehend these alphanumeric medical codes and their corresponding medical terminology.  
- This is concerning as it could impact the reliability of LLM-based systems in the healthcare domain, where inaccuracies can have serious consequences.

Proposed Solution  
- The authors evaluate the ability of various state-of-the-art LLMs to predict medical diagnoses/procedures/medications from their associated standardized codes.
- Both general domain LLMs like GPT-3 and Clara and specialized biomedical LLMs like MedLLaMA are tested.
- Three experiments of increasing difficulty are designed - ordered codes, random codes, adversarial fake codes.
- Performance is assessed via accuracy metrics and detection of "hallucinations".

Key Contributions
- This is the first study assessing LLMs' understanding of medical codes widely used in clinical practice.  
- The results demonstrate clear deficiencies in medical coding comprehension across current LLMs.
- Even biomedical LLMs struggle, highlighting issues with representing these codes properly during pre-training.
- The findings call for better strategies to capture nuances of medical codes within LLMs to improve reliability for healthcare applications.
- Future work should also examine LLMs' effectiveness in generating descriptions for medical codes.

In summary, this is an important study evaluating LLMs' readiness to handle practical healthcare coding tasks. The results reveal limitations that should inform the development of future medical AI systems and data representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models actually understand the meaning of medical codes commonly used in healthcare or if they tend to "hallucinate" responses, finding that while some models exhibit partial understanding, overall there is still significant room for improving representations of these codes to enhance reliability and trustworthiness for clinical applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) understand the inherent meaning of medical codes, which are widely used in healthcare practice. The authors evaluate various off-the-shelf LLMs as well as LLMs specifically designed for biomedical applications to assess their awareness and understanding of domain-specific medical terminologies such as ICD codes, procedure codes, medication codes, and laboratory codes. 

The key finding is that these LLMs do not fully comprehend the meaning of the medical codes, highlighting a gap in their ability to represent and reason about these alphanumeric codes extensively used in healthcare. The authors call for improved strategies to effectively capture and represent the nuances of medical codes and terminologies within LLMs to make them more reliable and trustworthy for healthcare applications.

In summary, the main contribution is an analysis and assessment of the limitations of current LLMs in understanding medical codes, proposing this as an important area for future work to develop better representations and training methodologies for healthcare-focused LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes three distinct experiments to evaluate the ability of LLMs to understand medical codes. What is the rationale behind designing experiments with different levels of difficulty? How does this approach help determine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs when processing medical codes?

2. The first experiment involves predicting medical conditions from a list of ordered ICD codes within the same category. Why is evaluating performance on ordered codes important? What aspect of an LLM's understanding of medical codes does this assess?  

3. The second experiment uses a random sampling of codes instead of an ordered list. How does this mirror real-life EHR data and usage scenarios? What additional challenges does a random order introduce for the LLM?

4. The third experiment incorporates adversarial attacks by introducing fake codes among real ones. Why is testing model robustness to invalid inputs crucial for healthcare applications? How could poor performance on this task undermine trust in LLMs?

5. The paper analyzes three key metrics - accuracy, word matches, and match percentage. Why is it important to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the predictions? What unique insights does each metric provide?

6. The tokenization scheme used by LLMs is hypothesized as a reason for poor medical code understanding. How might limitations in handling numerical values lead to errors in encoding medical codes? What improvements to tokenization could address this?

7. What are some reasons the biomedical LLMs performed worse than general LLMs? What architectural or training factors might account for this unexpected outcome?

8. How do the levels of "hallucination" demonstrated in the results impact the reliability of using LLMs for tasks like clinical decision support? What risks does this pose?

9. What future work directions could build upon this initial study of LLM comprehension of medical codes? What other code types or tasks could be evaluated?  

10. How do insights from this analysis of medical coding relate to evaluating progress toward artificial general intelligence? What deficiencies does it reveal in how LLMs currently operate?
