# [Do Large Language Models understand Medical Codes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Medical codes like ICD, CPT, NDC, and LOINC are integral to healthcare systems and are widely used in clinical practice for billing, epidemiology, etc. 
- However, due to limitations in their architectural design and tokenization strategies, large language models (LLMs) may not fully comprehend these alphanumeric medical codes and their corresponding medical terminology.  
- This is concerning as it could impact the reliability of LLM-based systems in the healthcare domain, where inaccuracies can have serious consequences.

Proposed Solution  
- The authors evaluate the ability of various state-of-the-art LLMs to predict medical diagnoses/procedures/medications from their associated standardized codes.
- Both general domain LLMs like GPT-3 and Clara and specialized biomedical LLMs like MedLLaMA are tested.
- Three experiments of increasing difficulty are designed - ordered codes, random codes, adversarial fake codes.
- Performance is assessed via accuracy metrics and detection of "hallucinations".

Key Contributions
- This is the first study assessing LLMs' understanding of medical codes widely used in clinical practice.  
- The results demonstrate clear deficiencies in medical coding comprehension across current LLMs.
- Even biomedical LLMs struggle, highlighting issues with representing these codes properly during pre-training.
- The findings call for better strategies to capture nuances of medical codes within LLMs to improve reliability for healthcare applications.
- Future work should also examine LLMs' effectiveness in generating descriptions for medical codes.

In summary, this is an important study evaluating LLMs' readiness to handle practical healthcare coding tasks. The results reveal limitations that should inform the development of future medical AI systems and data representations.
