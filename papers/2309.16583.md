# [GPT-Fathom: Benchmarking Large Language Models to Decipher the   Evolutionary Path towards GPT-4 and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. How can a systematic, transparent, and reproducible benchmark be established to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs)? 2. What insights can be gained into the evolutionary path from GPT-3 to GPT-4 and beyond by studying the performance trends across different versions of OpenAI's models?3. How do leading closed-source LLMs from companies like OpenAI compare to open-source LLMs from the research community? What are the capability gaps?4. What is the impact of different training strategies and data (e.g. adding code data, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) on the capabilities of LLMs? 5. How sensitive are LLM capabilities to variations in prompt formatting and evaluation settings?6. Is there a "seesaw phenomenon" where improvements on some capabilities come at the cost of regressions on other capabilities even for the most advanced LLMs?In summary, the key focus is on benchmarking capabilities of LLMs in a rigorous and transparent manner to gain insights into their strengths, limitations, training dynamics and prompt sensitivity. The retrospective study on OpenAI's models is aimed at unraveling the mysterious path to advanced LLMs like GPT-4.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. Introducing GPT-Fathom, an open-source and reproducible evaluation suite for systematically assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 2. Evaluating over 10 leading LLMs, including OpenAI's models, on 20+ curated benchmarks covering different capability aspects under aligned settings. 3. Providing a retrospective analysis of OpenAI's earlier models from GPT-3 to GPT-4, offering insights into the evolutionary path towards advanced LLMs. 4. Identifying novel challenges faced by current LLMs, such as the seesaw phenomenon of capabilities and sensitivity to prompt formatting.5. Encouraging further research to enhance robustness, align capabilities, and improve less advanced facets of LLMs like mathematical reasoning.In summary, the key contribution is developing a comprehensive and aligned benchmark suite to evaluate LLMs, combined with insights from analyzing current models to guide future development. The goal is improving transparency and reproducibility in the fast-paced advancement of LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces GPT-Fathom, an open-source and reproducible large language model evaluation suite. It evaluates leading models like GPT-3/GPT-4 on aligned benchmarks across capability categories, providing insights into OpenAI's evolutionary path and model capabilities. The key goal is to improve LLM evaluation transparency and measure emerging models against the state-of-the-art.
