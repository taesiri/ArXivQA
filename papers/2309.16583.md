## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of language model evaluation:

- This paper introduces GPT-Fathom, a new comprehensive evaluation suite for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Other major LLM evaluation benchmarks include Anthropic's AI Safety Benchmarks, InstructEval, HELM, and SUPERGLUE. GPT-Fathom aims to provide systematic evaluation across a wide range of LLM capabilities.

- A key focus of this work is evaluating LLMs under consistent settings with aligned prompts. Many existing benchmarks reference scores from papers using different settings, which can make comparisons difficult. GPT-Fathom aims to address this by using standardized evaluation settings.

- The paper provides a retrospective analysis of models in OpenAI's GPT-3 to GPT-4 evolution. This helps shed light on the improvements over time and model versions. Other benchmarks have tended to focus evaluation on only the latest models. 

- GPT-Fathom covers capabilities like knowledge, reasoning, comprehension, math, coding, multilingual skills, and safety. The breadth of capabilities assessed is wider than some other benchmarks that focus on narrower aspects like reasoning or safety.

- The evaluation is done in a black-box style by analyzing model outputs rather than model internals. Some other benchmarks use white-box analysis of models' internal representations and likelihoods.

- GPT-Fathom includes both open-source and proprietary LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4. Some other benchmarks focus solely on open-source models.

In summary, GPT-Fathom provides a new extensive evaluation suite with broad capability coverage, standardized prompting, and analysis of multiple generations of models including proprietary LLMs. This allows comprehensive apples-to-apples comparison and tracing of progress across models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Adding additional evaluation benchmarks under existing capability categories to further extend GPT-Fathom's coverage. For example, supporting more benchmarks for the "Knowledge", "Reasoning", and "Comprehension" categories.

- Supporting more capability aspects beyond the ones currently evaluated, such as long-context understanding, multi-turn conversation, open-domain generation, LLM-based autonomous agents, and multi-modal capabilities. This would continue expanding the scope of GPT-Fathom.

- Evaluating more leading LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models as they continue to be developed. Keeping GPT-Fathom up-to-date as the field progresses. 

- Dedicating more research efforts to tackling the "seesaw phenomenon" of LLM capabilities, where improving one capability sometimes comes at the expense of others. Trying to develop LLMs with more universal and consistent improvements.

- Studying the impacts of model sensitivity and prompt tuning in more depth. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to minor prompt variations.

- Continuing to improve the transparency and reproducibility of LLM evaluations through platforms like GPT-Fathom.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: expanding benchmark coverage, supporting more capabilities, evaluating more models, addressing capability trade-offs, enhancing prompt robustness, and driving transparency. GPT-Fathom aims to continue serving as an evolving platform to enable this continued LLM research.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces GPT-Fathom, a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation suite for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key method is to systematically evaluate a collection of representative LLMs, including OpenAI's leading models as well as earlier ones, on a broad set of curated benchmarks across different capability categories. All evaluations are conducted under aligned settings for fair comparison. 

Specifically, the evaluated LLMs include both closed-source (e.g. GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-source models (e.g. LLaMA, Llama 2). The benchmark tasks cover capabilities like knowledge, reasoning, comprehension, math, coding, multilingual, and safety. For each task, consistent prompts and evaluation methods are used. Furthermore, the impact of varying number of shots, chain-of-thought prompting, and prompt templates is analyzed through ablation studies. The evaluation suite enables benchmarking the latest LLMs as well as retrospectively studying the evolution from GPT-3 to GPT-4. By standardizing evaluation settings, the work improves transparency and reproducibility in assessing LLMs. The code and evaluation platform are open-sourced.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces GPT-Fathom, a new benchmark suite for evaluating large language models (LLMs). GPT-Fathom aims to provide systematic, aligned, and reproducible evaluations of LLMs across a diverse set of capabilities. The authors evaluate over 10 leading LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others. They also retrospectively evaluate earlier OpenAI models like GPT-3 to study the evolution towards GPT-4. GPT-Fathom covers over 20 benchmarks spanning capabilities like knowledge, reasoning, comprehension, math, coding, multilingual skills, and safety. The benchmarks are carefully selected to cover diverse aspects of LLMs, use widely adopted datasets, and effectively differentiate between strong and weak models. 

The key findings from GPT-Fathom evaluations are: 1) GPT-4 demonstrates a significant leap over GPT-3 and other models on most capabilities; 2) Pretraining with code data seems to boost reasoning skills; 3) Fine-tuning provides more gains for weaker base models; 4) Advanced models still face challenges like sensitivity to prompts and trade-offs between capabilities. Overall, GPT-Fathom provides aligned, reproducible, and retrospective evaluations to characterize LLM capabilities and limitations. The authors encourage using GPT-Fathom to benchmark emerging models and identify areas for improvement. They also call for more research to address the identified challenges around robustness, capability trade-offs, and reaching well-rounded AGI abilities.
