# [Probabilistic Speech-Driven 3D Facial Motion Synthesis: New Benchmarks,   Methods, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18168)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new large-scale benchmark dataset and methodology for probabilistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. The authors create two large datasets from the VoxCeleb2 video corpus using state-of-the-art monocular face reconstruction methods, containing over 1 million sequences from thousands of speakers. They introduce new metrics beyond lip sync error to measure realism, diversity, and faithfulness to speech, including pretrained speech-mesh synchronization networks and style recognition networks. Their proposed probabilistic model based on discrete latent variable modeling and transformers outperforms existing deterministic and non-deterministic methods across these metrics. The model achieves higher realism and diversity scores while maintaining strong speech synchronization. It also better captures speaker style variation compared to methods susceptible to over-smoothing from regression objectives. The authors further demonstrate applications of diversity enabled by the probabilistic model and dataset, including realistic style matching and generating synthetic visual data to improve audio-visual speech recognition. The comprehensive benchmark and analysis provide useful tools for future research on this task.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new large-scale benchmark dataset for speech-driven 3D facial animation by reconstructing faces from the VoxCeleb2 video dataset using state-of-the-art monocular face reconstruction methods.

2. Introducing new metrics beyond just lip vertex error to evaluate speech synchronization, diversity, coverage of ground truth motions, and style matching.

3. Developing a probabilistic model for speech-driven facial animation that outperforms existing methods on the new benchmark across the proposed metrics. The model is designed to balance diversity and faithfulness to the speech signal.

4. Demonstrating applications of the diversity captured by the probabilistic model and dataset, including style matching and generating synthetic training data for audio-visual speech recognition.
