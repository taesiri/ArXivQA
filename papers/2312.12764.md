# [Lattice Rescoring Based on Large Ensemble of Complementary Neural   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reducing word error rates (WERs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, especially in challenging conditions like noisy environments or conversational speech, remains an open problem. 

- Rescoring ASR hypothesis lattices using advanced neural language models (NLMs) is a promising approach, but prior work has only investigated combining a small number (up to 4) of complementary NLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate the effectiveness of using a larger ensemble of up to 8 complementary NLMs for iterative lattice rescoring to gradually refine language scores and reduce WER.

- The 8 NLMs used are: forward/backward LSTM/Transformer LMs, each trained with 2 different random initialization seeds. These NLMs are complementary.

- Iteratively rescore lattices by changing the NLM at each iteration, equally combining scores from all NLMs up to that point using an interpolation scheme.

- Also investigate carrying over context (previous rescoring results) across lattices to leverage contextual information. Test both forward and backward context carry-over.

Main Contributions:
- Show that combining 6-8 complementary NLMs effectively improves iterative lattice rescoring performance. Steady WER reductions are achieved even at later NLM combinations.

- Demonstrate that lattice rescoring has an advantage over n-best rescoring when using a large NLM ensemble. The search space is less restricted.

- Find that forward and backward context carry-over are equally effective for improving performance.

- Iterative NLM combination has the potential to outperform simultaneous combination in a fast lattice rescoring setting by enabling more stable refinement of scores.

- Achieve a 24.4% relative WER reduction compared to the ASR 1-best baseline result using the full method with 8 NLMs and context carry-over.
