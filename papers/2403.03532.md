# [Extend Your Own Correspondences: Unsupervised Distant Point Cloud   Registration by Progressive Distance Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Registering distant point clouds (5-50 meters apart) captured from different vehicles can benefit various self-driving applications. 
- However, existing methods rely on expensive pose labels during training and fail to generalize to new unlabeled datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EYOC, an unsupervised method to register distant point clouds without any pose labels or other modalities like images.

- Core idea: Train a feature extractor in a progressive self-supervised fashion. In each round, a teacher model trains a student model to register slightly farther point clouds, enabling automatic label generation.

- To prevent divergence, EYOC starts from near point clouds and gradually increases distance over training epochs. 

- To generate high-quality correspondence labels:
   - Propose a spatial filtering technique to select stable features from low-density regions, which are more consistent across distances.
   - Perform speculative registration on filtered correspondences to align point clouds.
   - Rediscover more correspondences between aligned clouds as supervision.
   
Main Contributions:

- Analyze the near-far diversity phenomenon in LiDAR point clouds and leverage it for spatial filtering.

- Propose an unsupervised registration framework that adapts to new unlabeled datasets without any pose labels or additional modalities.

- Extensive experiments show EYOC achieves comparable performance to supervised methods, outperforms them by 17.4% on new datasets, and enjoys lower training cost.

In summary, the paper presents a novel unsupervised distant point cloud registration method designed specifically for self-driving vehicles to leverage sequential unlabeled data. The progressive self-labeling scheme allows adapting the model to new data distributions on the fly.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an unsupervised method for distant point cloud registration that progressively trains a feature extractor to generate its own correspondence labels from consecutive unlabeled LiDAR sweeps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing EYOC, an unsupervised distant point cloud registration method that can effectively adapt to new data distributions without requiring pose labels or other input modalities. Specifically:

1) It analyzes the "near-far diversity phenomenon" of LiDAR point clouds and shows that low-density regions produce more consistent feature correspondences when extending the distance between point clouds. This insight is used to develop effective correspondence filtering techniques. 

2) It proposes a progressive self-labeling scheme to train a feature extractor over multiple rounds on gradually farther point cloud pairs. This allows smooth convergence when registering distant point clouds.

3) Extensive experiments show EYOC achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods on major self-driving datasets, while outperforming them on out-of-domain generalization. It also has lower training cost.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an unsupervised registration method that works on distant outdoor point clouds and generalizes effectively to new distributions, enabled by insights into spatial properties of LiDAR features. This moves towards enabling collaborative perception without needing pose labels.

The paper proposes an unsupervised method called "Extend Your Own Correspondences (EYOC)" for registering distant point clouds with extreme low overlap and density variation. Key ideas include correspondence filtering based on the "near-far diversity" observation, self-supervision through a student-teacher model with EMA, and progressive extension of point cloud distance during training. The method requires no ground truth pose labels or other modalities like RGB images. Overall the paper focuses on enabling unsupervised adaptation of point cloud registration methods to new unseen datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new unsupervised method for distant point cloud registration called EYOC. What is the core idea behind EYOC and how does it enable self-supervision on distant point cloud pairs?

2. EYOC adopts a progressive self-labeling scheme to train the feature extractor in multiple rounds. Explain this scheme in detail and discuss how it helps prevent divergence during training. 

3. The paper talks about the "near-far diversity phenomenon" of LiDAR point clouds. Explain this phenomenon and how the insights from it are used to design the spatial filtering technique in EYOC.

4. What are the two main challenges encountered in the design of EYOC? Discuss the solutions proposed in the paper to deal with these challenges. 

5. Explain the correspondence filtering pipeline in detail. What is the rationale behind using Lowe's ratio and spatial filtering strategies? Why do they work better than prior techniques?

6. What is the purpose of the speculative registration step? Why is correspondence rediscovery done after aligning the point clouds instead of directly using the filtered correspondences?

7. Analyze the progressive dataset strategy. How does gradually increasing the difficulty help in the self-supervised paradigm compared to directly using distant point clouds?

8. Compare the finetuning versus training from scratch strategies for EYOC. When is one preferred over the other based on the experiments in the paper?

9. How does EYOC avoid error accumulation during the self-training process? Discuss the induction biases that prevent large errors from accumulating. 

10. What are some ways the adaptive spatial filtering technique can be improved to cater to new unseen datasets that may have different density distribution patterns?
