# [WonderJourney: Going from Anywhere to Everywhere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper introduces the problem of "perpetual 3D scene generation", which involves generating a potentially endless sequence of diverse yet coherently connected 3D scenes starting from an arbitrary initial scene specified by either an image or text description. The goal is to create an imaginary "wonderland" journey that transitions between different types of scenes and environments.

Proposed Solution - WonderJourney:
The paper proposes a modular framework called "WonderJourney" to address this problem using the latest advances in language and vision AI models. It consists of three key modules - (1) A large language model (LLM) that generates textual descriptions of sequential scenes, (2) A visual scene generation module that converts text to coherent 3D point cloud scenes, and (3) A vision-language model (VLM) that validates the generated scenes.

The scene description from the LLM provides common sense and semantic guidance. The visual module leverages techniques like text-to-image generation, depth estimation, image inpainting and 3D rendering to create geometrically consistent scenes. The VLM detects unwanted artifacts like borders or blurriness and triggers regenerations. The modular design allows easy swapping of the latest AI models.

Key Contributions:
- Formulation of the novel problem of perpetual 3D scene generation starting from arbitrary inputs
- Proposal of WonderJourney, a modular framework combining language and vision AI to generate coherent wonderland journeys 
- Scene generation module to convert text to 3D point clouds, handling challenges like depth inaccuracies and disocclusions
- Qualitative and human preference evaluations showing WonderJourney produces more compelling and diverse results than prior scene generation methods

In summary, the paper introduces and provides an initial solution for an interesting new problem that combines the generations from language, image and 3D scene AI models to digitally create imaginative wonderland journeys.
