# [EqMotion: Equivariant Multi-agent Motion Prediction with Invariant   Interaction Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10876)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is to develop an equivariant multi-agent motion prediction model with invariant interaction reasoning. Specifically, it aims to propose a motion prediction network that:- Is equivariant to Euclidean geometric transformations (translation, rotation, reflection) of the input motion sequences. This equivariance property provides robustness and helps the model generalize better. - Can perform invariant interaction reasoning between agents. This allows the model to learn interaction relationships that are unaffected by the geometric transformations of the input.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse motion prediction tasks like particle dynamics, molecule dynamics, human skeleton motion, and pedestrian trajectories.The key hypothesis is that explicitly encoding equivariance and invariance properties will lead to better generalization and more accurate multi-agent motion prediction across different tasks. The proposed EqMotion model with its equivariant geometric feature learning, invariant pattern feature learning, and invariant interaction reasoning modules is designed to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the central research question is: Can incorporating equivariance and invariance improve multi-agent motion prediction performance across diverse tasks? The authors hypothesize yes and design the EqMotion model to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes EqMotion, the first motion prediction model that theoretically ensures sequence-to-sequence motion equivariance based on the parametric network. With equivariance, EqMotion promotes more generalization ability of motion feature learning, leading to more robust and accurate prediction.2. It proposes a novel invariant interaction reasoning module, in which the captured interactions between agents are invariant to the input motion under Euclidean transformations. This helps EqMotion achieve more generalization ability and stability in interaction reasoning.3. It proposes to learn both equivariant geometric features and invariant pattern features through designed equivariant/invariant operations. This provides expressive motion representations by exploiting motions' spatial-temporal dependencies. 4. It conducts experiments on four types of scenarios (particle dynamics, molecule dynamics, human skeleton motion, pedestrian trajectories) and shows that EqMotion outperforms many task-specific state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its general applicability.5. It presents that EqMotion has a very compact model size (less than 30% of other models) thanks to its equivariant design, and shows EqMotion using only 5% training data can outperform some full-data baselines.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and general motion prediction framework EqMotion that ensures equivariance and invariance properties, achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, and has strong generalization ability across different scenarios. Theoretical analysis is provided and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EqMotion.
