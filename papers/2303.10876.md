# [EqMotion: Equivariant Multi-agent Motion Prediction with Invariant   Interaction Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10876)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is to develop an equivariant multi-agent motion prediction model with invariant interaction reasoning. Specifically, it aims to propose a motion prediction network that:- Is equivariant to Euclidean geometric transformations (translation, rotation, reflection) of the input motion sequences. This equivariance property provides robustness and helps the model generalize better. - Can perform invariant interaction reasoning between agents. This allows the model to learn interaction relationships that are unaffected by the geometric transformations of the input.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse motion prediction tasks like particle dynamics, molecule dynamics, human skeleton motion, and pedestrian trajectories.The key hypothesis is that explicitly encoding equivariance and invariance properties will lead to better generalization and more accurate multi-agent motion prediction across different tasks. The proposed EqMotion model with its equivariant geometric feature learning, invariant pattern feature learning, and invariant interaction reasoning modules is designed to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the central research question is: Can incorporating equivariance and invariance improve multi-agent motion prediction performance across diverse tasks? The authors hypothesize yes and design the EqMotion model to demonstrate this.
