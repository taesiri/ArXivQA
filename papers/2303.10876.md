# [EqMotion: Equivariant Multi-agent Motion Prediction with Invariant   Interaction Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10876)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is to develop an equivariant multi-agent motion prediction model with invariant interaction reasoning. Specifically, it aims to propose a motion prediction network that:- Is equivariant to Euclidean geometric transformations (translation, rotation, reflection) of the input motion sequences. This equivariance property provides robustness and helps the model generalize better. - Can perform invariant interaction reasoning between agents. This allows the model to learn interaction relationships that are unaffected by the geometric transformations of the input.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse motion prediction tasks like particle dynamics, molecule dynamics, human skeleton motion, and pedestrian trajectories.The key hypothesis is that explicitly encoding equivariance and invariance properties will lead to better generalization and more accurate multi-agent motion prediction across different tasks. The proposed EqMotion model with its equivariant geometric feature learning, invariant pattern feature learning, and invariant interaction reasoning modules is designed to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the central research question is: Can incorporating equivariance and invariance improve multi-agent motion prediction performance across diverse tasks? The authors hypothesize yes and design the EqMotion model to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes EqMotion, the first motion prediction model that theoretically ensures sequence-to-sequence motion equivariance based on the parametric network. With equivariance, EqMotion promotes more generalization ability of motion feature learning, leading to more robust and accurate prediction.2. It proposes a novel invariant interaction reasoning module, in which the captured interactions between agents are invariant to the input motion under Euclidean transformations. This helps EqMotion achieve more generalization ability and stability in interaction reasoning.3. It proposes to learn both equivariant geometric features and invariant pattern features through designed equivariant/invariant operations. This provides expressive motion representations by exploiting motions' spatial-temporal dependencies. 4. It conducts experiments on four types of scenarios (particle dynamics, molecule dynamics, human skeleton motion, pedestrian trajectories) and shows that EqMotion outperforms many task-specific state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its general applicability.5. It presents that EqMotion has a very compact model size (less than 30% of other models) thanks to its equivariant design, and shows EqMotion using only 5% training data can outperform some full-data baselines.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and general motion prediction framework EqMotion that ensures equivariance and invariance properties, achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, and has strong generalization ability across different scenarios. Theoretical analysis is provided and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EqMotion.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes EqMotion, an efficient equivariant motion prediction model with invariant interaction reasoning, which learns Euclidean transformable geometric features and invariant pattern features through equivariant operations and invariant message passing to achieve robust and accurate multi-agent motion prediction across different scenarios.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-agent motion prediction:- The key novelty of this paper is proposing an end-to-end model that ensures motion equivariance and interaction invariance under Euclidean transformations. Most prior work does not explicitly enforce or guarantee these properties. This work stands out by incorporating equivariance and invariance principles into the network architecture and operations.- Compared to other equivariant networks like SE(3)-Transformer, EGNN, and Rotograph, a main difference is this paper focuses on sequence-to-sequence motion prediction rather than single state prediction. The proposed method can exploit temporal motion dependencies in a way that state-based models cannot.- For interaction modeling, this paper reasons about interaction types in a novel way through an invariant interaction graph. Many previous methods like NRI, NMMP, and Trajectron++ use attention or pooling to model interactions, without explicitly categorizing interaction types.- The experiments cover a broad range of applications - particle physics, molecules, human motion, trajectories. The consistent improvements across tasks highlight the general applicability of the approach. Many other papers focus evaluation on a single domain.- The model architecture is relatively simple and lightweight compared to recent large transformer-based models. Yet it still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that enforcing equivariance/invariance principles provides a useful inductive bias for this problem.- Limitations are that it may not utilize map information as effectively as some recent autonomous driving works. The run time and memory costs are also not analyzed in depth.Overall, by introducing equivariance and invariance properties, this paper makes important foundational contributions that could inspire a new line of thinking and research on motion prediction. The principles are broadly applicable, while still demonstrating impressive empirical results across diverse tasks.
