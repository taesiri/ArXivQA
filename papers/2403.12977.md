# [SportsNGEN: Sustained Generation of Multi-player Sports Gameplay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating realistic and sustained simulations of sports gameplay from player and ball tracking data is challenging. Prior work has focused on short-term trajectory prediction rather than full game simulation.
- Desired properties of generated sports simulations are: highly realistic, sustained for duration of gameplay, customizable to emulate a player's style, and measurable to quantify quality.

Proposed Solution: 
- Present Sports Neural Generator (\engine{}) - a transformer decoder model trained on player and ball tracking sequences and match metadata that can generate sustained, realistic gameplay simulations.

- Represent player/ball state with a token containing position, velocity, distance to ball, identity encoding, and elapsed time. Add noise to ball states during training for stability.

- Model predicts future states by classifying locations on a discrete 3D (ball) or 2D (player) grid at each timestep. Uses nucleus sampling for exploration.

- Additional components: shot classifier to analyze rallies and define end logic, ability to fine-tune model on player data to customize style.

Contributions:

- Sustained, realistic tennis match simulation by chaining together generated rallies with logic and shot analysis.

- Metrics to quantify realism - compare distributions and statistics (serve speed, rally length etc.) between real and simulated data.

- Enhancements like relative velocity, identity encoding, and noise injection significantly improve simulations.

- Fine-tuning allows customizing model to a player's style. Enables applications like analyzing counterfactual scenarios.

- Approach also shown to work for football through passing sequence generation.

In summary, the paper presents a novel transformer-based approach capable of simulated realistic, sustained and customizable sports gameplay for analysis and decision support.
