# [PD-GAN: Probabilistic Diverse GAN for Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an image inpainting method that can generate multiple diverse and realistic results for a given corrupted image? The key points are:- Most existing image inpainting methods generate a single result for each input image. However, the missing content often has multiple plausible solutions. - The authors propose a novel approach called PD-GAN to address this limitation and produce diverse inpainting results. - PD-GAN is based on a conditional GAN that takes a random noise vector as input. It modulates this noise vector using a novel SPDNorm module to incorporate guidance from a coarse image prior and mask.- SPDNorm adaptively controls the degree of diversity vs realism spatially, allowing more diversity towards hole centers and more realism near boundaries.- A new perceptual diversity loss is used to explicitly encourage diversity during training.- Experiments on benchmark datasets show PD-GAN generates higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by modulating noise vectors conditioned on spatial guidance, and using a perceptual diversity loss, their proposed PD-GAN can generate multiple diverse and realistic inpaintings for the same corrupted image input. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes PD-GAN, a novel probabilistic diverse GAN for image inpainting to generate multiple and diverse visually realistic results. - It introduces the spatially probabilistic diversity normalization (SPDNorm) module to control the probability of producing diverse results based on spatial location. SPDNorm contains both hard and soft versions to balance diversity and visual realism.- It proposes a perceptual diversity loss to further enhance the diversity of generated results. - Experimental results on benchmark datasets show PD-GAN can generate higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to previous methods.In summary, the key novelty is the proposed PD-GAN framework with SPDNorm and perceptual diversity loss for producing diverse and realistic image inpainting. The model architecture and loss design empower the diversity of results while maintaining visual realism.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a probabilistic diverse GAN (PD-GAN) for image inpainting that uses a spatially probabilistic diversity normalization module and perceptual diversity loss to generate multiple realistic and diverse image completions for irregular hole regions in corrupted images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel approach for diverse image inpainting using a probabilistic diverse generative adversarial network (PD-GAN). Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Most prior image inpainting methods focus on generating a single realistic output for each input image. In contrast, this paper tackles the problem of diverse image inpainting, where the goal is to generate multiple varied outputs that fill in the missing regions in different plausible ways. - Some recent works like PICNet and UCTGAN have also explored diverse image inpainting. However, they are based on conditional VAE architectures that encode the corrupted image into a latent distribution and decode samples from it. As discussed in the paper, modeling the distribution based on the masked image limits diversity, especially for irregular masks. PD-GAN instead samples the latent code from a standard Gaussian and modulates it using spatial priors.- The proposed SPDNorm module is related to SPADE normalization from previous work, but incorporates learned soft and hard probabilistic diversity maps. This allows selectively reducing reliance on the prior towards the center of holes to increase diversity. SPADE always fully depends on the prior.- A perceptual diversity loss is introduced to directly maximize diversity in feature space. Previous approaches like PICNet rely more on reconstruction losses that encourages a deterministic mapping, hampering diversity.- Experiments show PD-GAN generates more diverse outputs than PICNet and other methods, while maintaining realistic image content. The design choices like sampling latents rather than encoding inputs appear to be more suitable for irregular mask inpainting.In summary, this paper introduces a novel GAN-based approach and training methodology specialized for the task of diverse image inpainting, achieving superior performance to prior works. The overall approach and specific components like SPDNorm and the diversity loss are tailored for diverse generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the conclusion section:- Exploring alternative ways to model the probabilistic diversity maps in SPDNorm. For example, learning the maps in a more dynamic way based on input images rather than prescribing them. - Extending PD-GAN for other image generation tasks beyond inpainting, such as super-resolution, denoising, etc. The probabilistic modeling of diversity could be useful for these tasks as well.- Improving the training stability and sample quality further. While PD-GAN shows improved results, there is still room for enhancement. - Studying how to better evaluate the quality and diversity of generated images, as this remains a challenging problem. New quantitative metrics in addition to user studies could help.- Applying the idea of modeling spatial probability for diversity to other generative models like GANs, VAEs, normalizing flows etc. The core idea could have broader applicability.- Exploring conditional PD-GANs that take additional input like segmentation mask, sketches etc to better guide the inpainting process.In summary, the main future directions are around improving the probabilistic diversity modeling, enhancing training and evaluation, and extending the approach to other tasks and generative models. There remain interesting open research problems to explore in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes PD-GAN, a probabilistic diverse GAN for image inpainting. The goal is to generate multiple visually realistic and diverse results for an input image with missing or corrupted regions. PD-GAN is built on a vanilla GAN that decodes random noise vectors to images. To incorporate context constraints, PD-GAN modulates the noise vector features from coarse to fine by injecting an initially restored image and the hole mask at multiple scales. This is done using a proposed SPDNorm module which balances realism and diversity: pixels near hole boundaries are forced to be more deterministic based on context while pixels in hole centers have more freedom to generate diverse results. Specifically, SPDNorm contains learned hard and soft probabilistic diversity maps that control feature fusion based on distance to the hole boundary. The hard map uses fixed probabilities based on distance while the soft map learns probabilities adaptively. PD-GAN also uses a perceptual diversity loss to maximize diversity of generated images. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and Paris StreetView datasets show PD-GAN generates more diverse and realistic inpainting results than previous methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes PD-GAN, a probabilistic diverse generative adversarial network for image inpainting. The goal is to generate multiple visually realistic and diverse solutions for an input image with missing or corrupted regions. The key idea is to modulate features of a random noise vector using a novel spatially probabilistic diversity normalization (SPDNorm) module. This allows combining prior information from a coarsely reconstructed image with the flexibility of sampling different noise vectors. The SPDNorm module contains learned hard and soft probabilistic diversity maps to control the reliance on prior information. Pixels near hole boundaries rely more on the prior to ensure realistic coherence with context, while pixels in hole centers are more free to explore solutions based on the noise. Additionally, a perceptual diversity loss is proposed to explicitly encourage diversity of outputs. Experiments on datasets like CelebA-HQ, Places2 and Paris StreetView demonstrate PD-GAN generates higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to recent methods. The ablation studies validate the importance of the proposed SPDNorm module and perceptual diversity loss.In summary, PD-GAN presents an effective framework to produce multiple realistic and diverse solutions for image inpainting through a probabilistic modulation approach. The introduced components provide useful techniques for controlling diversity in image generation problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper proposes PD-GAN, a probabilistic diverse GAN for image inpainting. The key idea is to modulate a random noise vector using a spatially probabilistic diversity normalization (SPDNorm) module and prior information from a pre-trained partial convolution model. The SPDNorm contains hard and soft components to control the diversity and realism in different spatial regions - increasing diversity towards the center of the hole region while maintaining consistency with the surrounding image content near the hole boundaries. The model is trained with a proposed perceptual diversity loss that maximizes feature distance between outputs to encourage diversity. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PD-GAN generates multiple plausible and realistic inpainting results.
