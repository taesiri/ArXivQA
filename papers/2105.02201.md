# PD-GAN: Probabilistic Diverse GAN for Image Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an image inpainting method that can generate multiple diverse and realistic results for a given corrupted image? The key points are:- Most existing image inpainting methods generate a single result for each input image. However, the missing content often has multiple plausible solutions. - The authors propose a novel approach called PD-GAN to address this limitation and produce diverse inpainting results. - PD-GAN is based on a conditional GAN that takes a random noise vector as input. It modulates this noise vector using a novel SPDNorm module to incorporate guidance from a coarse image prior and mask.- SPDNorm adaptively controls the degree of diversity vs realism spatially, allowing more diversity towards hole centers and more realism near boundaries.- A new perceptual diversity loss is used to explicitly encourage diversity during training.- Experiments on benchmark datasets show PD-GAN generates higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by modulating noise vectors conditioned on spatial guidance, and using a perceptual diversity loss, their proposed PD-GAN can generate multiple diverse and realistic inpaintings for the same corrupted image input. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.
