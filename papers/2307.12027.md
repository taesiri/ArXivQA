# [On the Effectiveness of Spectral Discriminators for Perceptual Quality   Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12027)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:What is the effectiveness of spectral discriminators for improving perceptual image quality in generative modeling? More specifically, the paper investigates the effectiveness of using spectral discriminators, which evaluate the Fourier spectra of images, in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image super-resolution. The authors note that recent studies have advocated for spectral discriminators to improve image fidelity in GANs, but their superiority over spatial discriminators is not well understood. To address this question, the paper analyzes spatial and spectral discriminators in the context of perceptual super-resolution, examining their robustness to different frequency perturbations. The analyses reveal that:- Spatial discriminators are better at identifying differences in the low-frequency range- Spectral discriminators are better at identifying differences in the high-frequency rangeBased on these findings, the paper proposes using spatial and spectral discriminators together in an "ensembled" discriminator, arguing they are complementary. The authors design a spectral Transformer to enable this, applying a per-patch Fourier transform. Experiments on super-resolution and no-reference image quality assessment validate the approach, showing the ensembled discriminator helps align generated image spectra better to real data and predicts perceptual quality more accurately.In summary, the central hypothesis is that spectral discriminators are effective for perceptual quality improvement in GANs, but spatial discriminators still provide complementary benefits. The key contribution is demonstrating this via frequency domain analysis and proposing an ensembled discriminator architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a method to improve the perceptual quality of super-resolution images generated by GANs using spectral discriminators. The main contributions are:1. It provides an analysis of spatial vs. spectral discriminators from a frequency perspective, showing that spatial discriminators focus on low frequencies while spectral discriminators focus on high frequencies. 2. It reveals that spatial and spectral discriminators are complementary, with spatial better for low frequencies and spectral better for high frequencies. Therefore, using both together can improve results.3. It introduces a spectral Transformer architecture that converts images to the frequency domain using a per-patch Fourier Transform. This allows the Transformer to operate on full 2D spectra efficiently. 4. It demonstrates improved perceptual quality and spectrum alignment of super-resolution results by adding the proposed spectral Transformer discriminator.5. It shows the proposed dual discriminator (spatial + spectral Transformer) improves performance on no-reference image quality assessment by better matching human perceptual judgments.In summary, the key ideas are using frequency analysis to show the complementarity of spatial and spectral discriminators, proposing a spectral Transformer to improve spectral discrimination, and demonstrating improved perceptual quality in super-resolution and image quality assessment. The combination of spatial and spectral discrimination is the main contribution for improving GAN results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper: The paper proposes using both spatial and spectral discriminators together in generative adversarial networks for image super-resolution to improve perceptual quality, as they are complementary - the spatial discriminator is better at identifying low frequency differences while the spectral discriminator is better at identifying high frequency differences.
