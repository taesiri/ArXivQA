## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement: 
Small-sized quadruped robots have limited and weak sensors due to size constraints, making it difficult for them to accurately perceive and adapt to changes in the environment. This poses challenges for using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adaptive locomotion, as insufficient sensor data makes it hard to obtain good feedback.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel RL approach focused on extracting key perception information to enhance environmental adaptability for small quadruped robots. The key ideas are:

1) Analyze sensor data patterns during locomotion using Fourier transforms. Identify frequencies related to gait strides. Filter noise and extract essential signals using Inverse Fourier Transforms.

2) Model essential signals as a sum of sinusoidal functions. Use function parameters to describe differences in environment types. 

3) Design state space using above model and historical actions. Use multifunctional rewards tailored to different tasks.

4) Define action space based on limb trajectory parameters. Apply proximal policy optimization algorithm for RL.

Contributions:

- Effective perception information extraction methodology to address limitations of small quadruped platforms

- Sinusoidal function modeling approach to capture environmental variations from limited sensor data

- Flexible state space and multifunctional reward formulation for enhancing adaptability

- Demonstrated capability to achieve stable locomotion across different complex environments using only IMU data

The proposed RL approach enables small-sized quadruped robots with constrained sensing capabilities to perceive changes in the environment and autonomously adapt their locomotion accordingly using trial-and-error learning. This enhances their mobility in unknown real-world environments.
