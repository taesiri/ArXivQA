# [On Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhancing Entity Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify and consolidate records referring to the same real-world entity across one or more datasets. As data volume increases, manual ER becomes infeasible and uncertainty arises in algorithmic approaches. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promise in enhancing ER using their advanced linguistic capabilities. However, querying LLMs to assist ER can incur significant costs at scale. Therefore, the key challenge is selecting the optimal set of matching questions (MQs) for LLMs that maximizes uncertainty reduction within a specified budget. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces an innovative approach that employs LLMs to refine entity resolution produced by existing tools. It models the problem as possible partitions with assigned probabilities and uses Shannon entropy to quantify uncertainty. To select the optimal MQs under a budget constraint, it formulates the MQs selection problem (MQsSP) and proves it to be NP-hard. A greedy approximation algorithm is then proposed that chooses MQs to maximize the reduction of entropy after receiving LLM responses. Confidence scores from LLMs are used to adjust probability distributions of partitions.

Key Contributions:
- Novel workflow to optimally leverage LLMs to enhance entity resolution using entropy metric for uncertainty.
- Identification and formulation of MQsSP problem, proof of its NP-hardness. 
- Greedy approximation algorithm for MQsSP that maximizes uncertainty reduction under budget constraints.
- Method to associate LLM responses with accuracy probability for adjusting potential partition distributions.

The solution focuses on maximizing effectiveness and cost-efficiency in using LLMs to improve entity resolution, with extensive experiments demonstrating its efficiency. Key future work includes adaptive modification of possible partitions based on LLM responses.
