# [A General Calibrated Regret Metric for Detecting and Mitigating   Human-Robot Interaction Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Robots rely on human behavior prediction models when operating around people. However, these models make errors, especially on out-of-distribution interactions. 
- Not all prediction errors impact robot performance equally. It is challenging to quantify the system-level failures induced specifically by mispredictions.

Proposed Solution:  
- Identify that the mathematical notion of regret precisely captures when incorrect predictions degraded closed-loop robot performance. 
- Propose a novel calibrated regret metric that transforms regret to probability space instead of absolute reward space. This enables fair comparison of anomalies across diverse contexts and deployment scenarios.
- Use the calibrated regret metric to automatically identify a subset of deployment interactions that exhibited high regret. These interactions correspond to system-level prediction failures.

Main Contributions:
- Derive a general calibrated regret metric based on probability space that removes the need for explicit reward functions. Enables regret calculation even for generative neural planners.
- Metric ranks deployment interactions by robot regret, allowing automatic identification of system-level prediction failures for a given autonomy stack.
- Show that fine-tuning predictors on high-regret deployment data can improve closed-loop robot performance in subsequent deployments, using 77% less data than fine-tuning on all interactions.
- Demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in autonomous driving simulations and a toy social navigation domain with a generative planner.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to detect impactful prediction failures using a calibrated regret metric. It shows this high-regret data can be leveraged in a data-efficient way to improve robot decision making performance when re-deployed.
