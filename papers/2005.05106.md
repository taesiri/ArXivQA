# [Multi-band MelGAN: Faster Waveform Generation for High-Quality   Text-to-Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05106)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to build a faster and higher quality neural vocoder for text-to-speech based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). 

Specifically, the paper aims to improve upon the MelGAN neural vocoder to make it faster and produce higher quality speech synthesis. The main hypotheses are:

1. Increasing the receptive field of the generator will improve speech quality by better modeling long-term dependencies. 

2. Replacing the feature matching loss with a multi-resolution STFT loss will enable better measurement of differences between real and fake speech.

3. Using a multi-band architecture with a shared generator for all bands will reduce computational complexity and speed up waveform generation. 

4. Combining sub-band and full-band multi-resolution STFT losses will improve quality and training stability of the multi-band model.

The experiments aim to test these hypotheses and demonstrate a faster high-quality neural vocoder based on an improved MelGAN model with multi-band processing. The vocoder is evaluated both in isolation and when integrated into an end-to-end TTS system.
