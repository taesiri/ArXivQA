# [Attendre: Wait To Attend By Retrieval With Evicted Queries in   Memory-Based Transformers for Long Context Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have quadratic complexity w.r.t sequence length, making it difficult to process long sequences. Prior works use sparsity or compression techniques, but still require reading the entire sequence. 
- Other methods use a memory to store past activations to process sequences in chunks, but require large memory size and are often specific to certain architectures. 
- Existing memory designs are unidirectional, preventing their use in bidirectional contexts like encoders or decoder-only LMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Use eviction policies like LRA and LFA to reduce memory size. These policies evict the least important entries based on attention scores.
- Propose Attendre layer with key-value (K/V) memory and separate query (Q) memory. When query is evicted from Q memory, use it to retrieve K/V memory which contains "future" entries.
- Add encoder output memory in encoder-decoder models to store encoder activations for decoder access.

Main Contributions:
- Novel eviction policies based on attention scores to minimize memory size
- Attendre layer for bidirectional attention by retrieving K/V memory with evicted queries from Q memory
- Evaluation on TriviaQA reading comprehension task shows proposed methods match performance of original models on long contexts with small memory

In summary, the paper introduces techniques to efficiently process long contexts in Transformers without quadratic complexity blowup. The methods require no model retraining and enable bidirectional attention for decoding tasks. Experiments validate their effectiveness at extending context length for reading comprehension.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes to use eviction policies like LRA and LFA to reduce memory size and support bidirectional attention in memory-augmented transformers for long context processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing to use eviction policies like LRA (Least Recently Attended) and LFA (Least Frequently Attended) to reduce the memory size and adapt memory-based Transformers to various architectures. These policies leverage attention scores to determine the importance of memory entries.

2. Proposing the Attendre layer, a "wait-to-attend" mechanism that uses a query memory and a key-value memory to support bidirectional attention over future key-values, relaxing the unidirectional restriction of previous memory-based methods. 

3. Evaluating the proposed methods on the TriviaQA reading comprehension task using two Transformer models - PaLM 2-S and FLAN-T5 XXL. The results show the methods can help the models process much longer contexts and achieve competitive performance compared to the original models taking the entire sequence at once, with greatly reduced memory requirements.

In summary, the main contributions are the novel memory designs using eviction policies and the Attendre layer to improve memory efficiency and support bidirectional attention in memory-based Transformers for long context processing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Long context modeling/processing
- Memory-based Transformers
- Eviction policies (FIFO, LRU, LFU, proposed LRA, LFA)
- Wait-to-attend mechanism
- Query memory (Q memory) 
- Key-value memory (K/V memory)
- Encoder output memory
- Context length extension 
- TriviaQA reading comprehension task
- Memorizing Transformer
- Attention Sink
- Least recently attended (LRA)
- Least frequently attended (LFA)

The paper proposes using eviction policies like LRA and LFA to reduce the memory size needed in memory-based Transformers for long context processing. It also introduces a "wait-to-attend" mechanism with separate query and key-value memories to support bidirectional attention. The methods are evaluated on the TriviaQA task for context length extension, and compared to baselines like Memorizing Transformer and Attention Sink. So those are some of the key terms and concepts covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using eviction policies like LRU and LFU to determine which activations to keep in the memory. How might these policies perform compared to simply keeping the oldest or newest activations? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The LRA and LFA policies use attention scores to determine activation importance. How sensitive are these methods to changes in the attention score distribution? How could the policies be adapted to handle varying distributions?

3. The paper uses a FIFO policy for the query memory. What potential benefits or drawbacks might there be from using a non-FIFO eviction policy for queries instead? How might this impact wait-to-attend behavior?

4. The initial score for new memory entries affects eviction behavior. What strategies could be used to set this hyperparameter in a robust, adaptive way? How might it interact with other policy details?

5. The paper proposes an encoder output memory for encoder-decoder models. What other strategies could be used to compress or selectively store encoder activations for decoding? How do they compare?

6. How do the proposed methods scale with extremely long context lengths? At what point might other compression techniques be needed alongside the eviction policies?

7. What types of inputs or tasks might be challenging for the proposed approach? When might the wait-to-attend mechanism struggle?

8. The paper uses a fixed chunk size for experiments. How does performance vary with chunk size? What are good strategies for setting this hyperparameter?

9. For practical deployments, how could the methods be adapted to run efficiently on accelerators like TPUs? What are the computational bottlenecks?

10. The paper focuses on reading comprehension. How well might the methods transfer to other long-context tasks like summarization, translation, or dialogue? What adaptations might be needed?
