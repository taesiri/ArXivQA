# [MSViT: Dynamic Mixed-Scale Tokenization for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02321)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a dynamic mixed-scale tokenization scheme for Vision Transformers (ViTs) called MSViT. The central hypothesis is that encoding uniform background regions of an image with coarse tokens and more cluttered/content-rich regions with fine tokens can improve the accuracy-complexity trade-off of ViTs. The key research questions addressed are:- How to design an efficient conditional gating mechanism to select the optimal token scale for each image region?- How to train this gating module jointly with the ViT backbone in an end-to-end manner?- How to control the learned distribution of token scales during training to avoid trivial solutions? - How to reduce the training overhead incurred by handling tokens at multiple scales?So in summary, the central goal is developing a dynamic mixed-scale tokenization scheme that can flexibly adapt the number of tokens per image based on its content, to improve efficiency of ViTs. The paper explores techniques to achieve this via a lightweight gating module, a generalized batch shaping loss, and adaptive trimming during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces MSViT, a dynamic mixed-scale tokenization scheme for Vision Transformers (ViTs). The key ideas and contributions are:- They propose a lightweight gating module that dynamically selects the tokenization scale (fine or coarse) for each local region of the input image. This allows transforming uninformative regions like background at coarser scales to reduce computational cost, while keeping detailed regions at finer scales. - The gating module is trained jointly with the ViT backbone in an end-to-end manner. It acts as a preprocessing step before the transformer, making it agnostic to the choice of ViT architecture.- They introduce a generalization of the batch-shaping loss called GBaS to better control the learned scale distribution during training. This enhances the dynamic behavior of the gating module.- The mixed-scale tokenization is lossless, covering the entire input image. This makes it well-suited for dense prediction tasks like segmentation, unlike pruning-based methods.- Experiments show MSViT improves efficiency in image classification and segmentation with minimal loss in accuracy. The gating module learns meaningful scale selection related to image contents.- The mixed-scale gating can be transferred across tasks and ViT architectures, demonstrating its versatility as a preprocessing module for ViTs.In summary, the key contribution is a lightweight and effective way to dynamically adapt the tokenization scale in ViTs to improve efficiency while retaining representation power. The introduced gating module and training techniques make this possible in an architecture-agnostic manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a dynamic mixed-scale tokenization scheme for Vision Transformers, where a lightweight gating module selects the optimal patch scale for each image region before feeding them to the transformer backbone, reducing computational costs while preserving performance.
