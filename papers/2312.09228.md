# [3DGS-Avatar: Animatable Avatars via Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09228)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel approach for creating highly realistic and animatable human avatars from monocular videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The key innovation is the integration of statistical human body modeling for articulation with a learned non-rigid deformation model into the 3DGS framework. This allows posing the avatar in novel poses while preserving detailed cloth wrinkles and folds. Their method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality compared to recent neural rendering techniques, with 400x faster training (30 minutes on a single GPU) and 250x faster inference (50+ FPS) by avoiding costly neural radiance field modeling. The explicit surface representation also allows the introduction of as-isometric-as-possible regularization that significantly enhances generalization to unseen poses. Experiments demonstrate photorealistic free-viewpoint rendering, animation capabilities, and robustness to extreme articulations. The simplicity yet effectiveness makes this the first approach to enable highly detailed avatars playable in real-time from monocular video.
