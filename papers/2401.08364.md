## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Kernel interpolation (KI) is an effective method for fitting spherical data, which has wide applications in image sciences. However, KI suffers from instability issues when dealing with noisy data, due to the large condition number of the kernel matrix. This limits the applicability of KI for real-world noisy spherical data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a weighted spectral filter (WSF) approach to enhance the stability of KI without compromising its prediction accuracy. The main ideas are:

1) Use spherical positive quadrature rules to assign different weights to scattered data points based on their geometric distribution. This embodies the different roles of data points in the interpolation. 

2) Introduce high-pass spectral filters, such as Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration and spectral cut-off, to the weighted kernel matrix. This excludes the small eigenvalues to reduce the condition number and stabilize the interpolation process.

3) Derive an optimal filter parameter selection strategy based on weighted cross-validation, which is tailored for spherical deterministic samples.

Main Contributions:

1) Methodology novelty: Propose WSF to equip KI to handle noisy spherical data by weighting and filtering schemes. Develop weighted cross-validation for parameter selection.

2) Theoretical novelty: Derive optimal learning rates for WSF using integral operator and bias-variance decomposition. The rates adapt to different noise levels and show WSF enhances stability without compromising accuracy.

3) Application guidance: Show by analysis and experiments that adding spectral filters with suitable parameters can effectively circumvent the limitation of KI in fitting noisy data. Provide feasible solutions for spherical data analysis.

In summary, the paper develops a weighted spectral filter approach to successfully stabilize kernel interpolation for analyzing noisy spherical data, with solid theoretical guarantees and comprehensive numerical verification. The methodology and analysis provide helpful guidance for handling real-world noisy data on spheres.

 This paper proposes a weighted spectral filter (WSF) approach to enhance the stability of kernel interpolation (KI) for fitting noisy scattered data on spheres. The main contributions are:

1) Methodology novelty: It proposes to use weighting based on spherical quadrature rules and filtering using high-pass filters to stabilize KI.
