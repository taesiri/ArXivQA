# [Testing MediaPipe Holistic for Linguistic Analysis of Nonmanual Markers   in Sign Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Facial expressions and movements like eyebrow raises play an important role in sign languages. Automatically tracking such movements can help sign language analysis and recognition. 
- Existing computer vision solutions like OpenFace (OF) can track facial landmarks, but have distortions when the head is tilted that obscure eyebrow movements. It is unclear if newer solutions like MediaPipe Holistic (MPH) improve on this.

Methods:
- The authors test MPH and compare it to OF using two datasets:
  1) Sentences in Kazakh-Russian Sign Language (KRSL) with different sentence types and head/eyebrow positions
  2) Controlled videos of head tilts with neutral and raised eyebrows
- They quantify distortions in eyebrow tracking, compare MPH vs OF, and visualize the 3D head models.

Results:
- For the KRSL sentences, MPH performs better than uncorrected OF, but not as well as OF with correction models
- For controlled head tilt videos, MPH introduces significant distortions in eyebrow tracking that obscure real raises
- MPH distortions are more complex and differ for raised vs neutral eyebrows, inner vs outer points

Conclusions:
- MPH 3D head models are clearly distorted by head tilts in a complex way
- Coincidentally, this helped relative to uncorrected OF for the specific KRSL test set
- But MPH is not reliable enough for linguistic facial analysis for sign languages
- Corrective models may help but will be harder to train than for OF

Main Contributions:
- First test of using newest facial tracking solution MPH for sign language analysis
- Demonstration that MPH has significant distortions affecting eyebrow tracking 
- Analysis of the precise nature and complexity of distortions compared to OF
- Highlights continued need for correction methods built on top of facial trackers


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper tests MediaPipe Holistic for linguistic analysis of nonmanual markers in sign languages, finds that it introduces complex distortions of facial landmarks with head movements, and concludes that additional correction models are still needed before it can be reliably used for such analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper tests MediaPipe Holistic (MPH) and compares it to OpenFace (OF) for the task of tracking eyebrow position in sign language videos. The authors apply MPH and OF to an existing data set of Kazakh-Russian Sign Language utterances and a newly collected data set of head movements and eyebrow raises. They find that:

1) Like OF, MPH introduces distortions in the estimated 3D facial model and eyebrow position when there are head tilts/movements. So MPH cannot be directly used for linguistic analysis of sign language facial expressions without corrections. 

2) The distortions introduced by MPH are more complex and different from those of OF. For example, pitch up vs pitch down movements affect MPH eyebrow tracking differently. This may make it more difficult to train correction models compared to OF.

3) MPH is not able to reliably track facial landmarks with large upward head tilts, which is problematic for typical sign language data.

In summary, the main contribution is an analysis and comparison of MPH to OF that shows MPH also requires correction models before it can be used for linguistics research on sign language facial expressions. The distortions in MPH are complex and differ from OF.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms appear to be:

- nonmanual markers
- MediaPipe Holistic
- OpenFace
- sign languages
- facial tracking
- head movements
- eyebrow movements
- 3D face reconstruction
- distortions
- correction models

The abstract specifically lists these keywords:

"nonmanual markers, MediaPipe Holistic, OpenFace"

So the main focus seems to be on using computer vision techniques like MediaPipe Holistic and OpenFace to track nonmanual markers like eyebrow and head movements in sign language videos, comparing their capabilities and distortions, and proposing correction models. The key terms reflect analyzing facial tracking for linguistic purposes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares MediaPipe Holistic (MPH) and OpenFace (OF) for analyzing eyebrow position and head tilt in sign language videos. What are the key differences in capabilities between these two computer vision solutions? What facial landmarks do they each track?

2. The paper tests MPH and OF on two datasets - an existing set of Kazakh-Russian Sign Language sentences, and a new set of videos with controlled head and eyebrow movements. Why was it important to test the solutions on both real sign language data and more controlled test data? 

3. The authors previously proposed a method to correct for distortions in OF's eyebrow tracking using manually annotated training data. What was the process for developing this correction model? What assumptions did it make about the nature of OF's distortions?

4. For the Kazakh sign language data, why does the uncorrected MPH output appear better than the uncorrected OF output in depicting differences between sentence types? What coincidental factors in this dataset lead to this result?

5. In the controlled test videos, what quantitative metrics and statistical tests did the authors use to measure and compare distortions in eyebrow position tracking for MPH vs OF? What were the key results?  

6. The paper visually depicts the distortions in the 3D face model output by MPH using multiple graphical techniques. What do these visualizations reveal about the nature and complexity of MPH's distortions due to head tilt? How do they differ from OF?

7. The paper finds that MPH exhibits worse tracking accuracy for outer eyebrows compared to inner eyebrows. Why might this be the case? Are there any hypotheses mentioned regarding the cause of this difference?

8. For the test video with raised eyebrows and upward pitch, why does MPH exhibit a much greater distortion compared to the video with neutral eyebrows and the same head movement? What might explain this counterintuitive finding?

9. The authors note that the complex distortions seen in MPH may make it more difficult to develop an effective correction model compared to their past work with OF. What modifications or enhancements to their correction modeling approach could help account for MPH's issues? 

10. The paper concludes that MPH cannot be directly used for linguistic analysis of sign language facial expressions without further work. What are some next steps the authors suggest to make computer vision solutions like MPH more accurate for this application? What other facial tracking benchmarks or test data could be valuable?
