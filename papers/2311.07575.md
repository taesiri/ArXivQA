## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents SPHINX, a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) that combines model weights, tuning tasks, visual embeddings, and high-resolution sub-images for improved multi-modal understanding. The key ideas are: 1) Unfreezing the large language model during pre-training and mixing weights from models trained on real-world and synthetic data to incorporate diverse semantics. 2) Mixing a variety of visual instruction tasks like VQA, region-level grounding, pose estimation etc. for multi-purpose capabilities using task-specific prompts. 3) Mixing visual embeddings from different network architectures, pre-training methods, and scales to obtain robust image representations. 4) Processing high-resolution images by mixing different scales and sub-images as tokens to capture fine details efficiently. Experiments show SPHINX achieves superior performance on diverse MLLM benchmarks. Extensions integrate SPHINX with other models like SAM for segmentation and Stable Diffusion for image editing. The joint mixing of weights, tasks, embeddings and resolution provides a versatile MLLM with exceptional visual reasoning and perception abilities.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents SPHINX, a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for visual instruction following. SPHINX incorporates three mixing strategies: mixed model weights from real-world and synthetic data domains, mixed tuning tasks like VQA, referring expression, pose estimation etc., and mixed visual embeddings from diverse encoders. This allows SPHINX to achieve superior alignment between vision and language. To handle high-resolution images, SPHINX mixes multi-scale and sub-image embeddings as the visual tokens, enabling fine-grained understanding without changing the visual encoder. Experiments demonstrate SPHINX's state-of-the-art performance on 10 MLLM benchmarks. Qualitative results showcase capabilities in tasks like segmentation, dense captioning and anomaly detection when integrated with other models. Through its mixing strategies, SPHINX advances multi-modal understanding and reasoning for general visual instruction following. The key novelty is the joint mixing of weights, tasks and visual embeddings to make SPHINX a versatile generalist MLLM instead of a specialist. Processing high-resolution images through multi-scale sub-image tokens is also a simple yet effective technique. Overall, SPHINX sets new benchmarks for MLLMs and opens possibilities for model integration to expand capabilities.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with superior multi-purpose visual instruction following capabilities, especially for fine-grained visual understanding tasks?

The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:

1) Unfreezing and further pre-training the LLM on vision-language data can better align vision and language modalities compared to only training a projection layer. 

2) Mixing model weights from LLMs trained on different vision-language datasets can integrate knowledge from diverse domains.

3) Jointly fine-tuning the MLLM on a diverse set of visual tasks with tailored prompts can impart multi-purpose reasoning abilities. 

4) Mixing visual embeddings from different architectures, pre-training methods, and granularities can provide more robust image representations. 

5) Mixing visual tokens from different scales and high-resolution sub-images can capture fine-grained details without compromising efficiency.

The central goal is to develop a versatile MLLM that excels on diverse visual tasks, especially fine-grained understanding, via the proposed joint mixing strategies. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of these hypotheses in improving multi-modal alignment, generalization, and fine-grained reasoning.
