# [Towards Improved Proxy-based Deep Metric Learning via Data-Augmented   Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00617)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing proxy-based deep metric learning (DML) methods learn distances between samples and proxy vectors. However, they do not explicitly align the overall distributions of the samples and proxies, resulting in ambiguity during training. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called Data-Augmented Domain Adaptation (DADA) to align the distributions of samples and proxies in proxy-based DML. Specifically:

1) A domain-level discriminator is introduced to distinguish between the sample domain and proxy domain, and an adversarial loss encourages domain confusion.

2) A category-level discriminator predicts classes of samples and proxies, with a discrepancy loss to match their predictions. This retains class discrimination. 

3) An augmented intermediate domain is constructed containing semantic mixup representations between samples and proxies. This provides a smooth bridge between domains.

4) Adversarial adaptation on the three domains aligns the proxy and sample distributions while retaining discriminative information.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to leverage domain adaptation techniques to align sample and proxy distributions for improving proxy-based DML

- Novel augmented intermediate domain acts as a semantic bridge between samples and proxies

- Combined adversarial domain and category-level adaptation significantly boosts performance of proxy losses 

- State-of-the-art results achieved on CUB200, CARS196, SOP and In-Shop retrieval benchmarks, largely outperforming prior proxy-based DML methods

The core idea is to transfer samples and proxies into a common domain distribution via adversarial adaptation techniques, overcoming the limitation of previous proxy methods only comparing individual sample-proxy distances. Aligning the overall distributions is shown to dramatically improve performance.
