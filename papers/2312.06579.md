# [Amazon Locker Capacity Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06579)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a solution to efficiently manage parcel locker capacity at Amazon. A major pain point was the high rate of unjustified rejections of customer delivery requests due to poor demand forecasting and lack of consideration of package dwell times. The authors develop an optimization model with three components: (1) Accurate locker demand forecasts using random forest regression, incorporating features like past deliveries, rejections, seasonality; (2) Estimation of package dwell time probabilities for each ship option using random forest classification and calibration; and (3) A linear programming formulation to compute optimal daily capacity reservations per ship option to maximize total locker throughput. The combined model is evaluated in a simulation system and then launched in production, resulting in a 9% global increase in locker throughput in 2018, allowing millions more customer delivery requests to be accepted. Key to success was the use of both machine learning techniques to leverage sparse locker data and optimization to strategically allocate capacity based on business objectives. The framework presented allows efficient management of limited capacity resources based on demand forecasts and customer behavior data.
