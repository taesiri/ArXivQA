# [Vertical Symbolic Regression via Deep Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00254)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical equations from experimental data. It is challenging when there are many input variables due to the exponentially large search space.
- Vertical Symbolic Regression (VSR) was proposed to reduce the search space by incrementally building equations from ones with fewer variables to ones with more variables. 
- However, existing VSR methods use genetic programming, which may not fully exploit the power of deep learning models that have shown success in symbolic regression. Directly combining VSR with deep reinforcement learning also faces difficulties in passing gradients and concatenating models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Vertical Symbolic Regression with Deep Policy Gradient (VSR-DPG), which models symbolic regression as a sequential decision process of applying production rules from a context-free grammar. 
- An RNN is used to predict the sequence of grammar rules. The parameters are trained with policy gradient to maximize the reward of producing high-quality expressions. 
- VSR is achieved by constructing the start symbol based on the best expression from the previous round, ensuring new expressions are compatible. This shrinks the search space.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation of symbolic regression as sequential rule application compatible with deep reinforcement learning
- New method VSR-DPG integrating the strengths of VSR and deep learning to scale symbolic regression
- Experiments showing VSR-DPG can recover equations with up to 50 variables, significantly more than prior VSR or deep learning methods
- Demonstrated success of VSR-DPG in discovering algebraic equations and differential equations

In summary, the paper presents a new synergistic combination of vertical symbolic regression and deep reinforcement learning to push the frontier of automated scientific discovery with symbolic regression. The proposed VSR-DPG method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a vertical symbolic regression method using deep policy gradient to incrementally discover symbolic equations with increasing numbers of variables, outperforming current approaches on benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Vertical Symbolic Regression using Deep Policy Gradient (VSR-DPG) for discovering symbolic equations with many independent variables. Specifically:

- It introduces a vertical discovery path to build equations by incrementally adding variables using control variable experiments, instead of modeling all variables simultaneously. This significantly reduces the search space.

- It represents symbolic expressions using grammar rules and models the search for expressions as a sequential decision making process of sampling grammar rule sequences using a recurrent neural network. The RNN is trained with a policy gradient objective to produce better expressions over time. 

- Experiments show that VSR-DPG can recover ground truth equations with up to 50 variables, which is beyond the capabilities of prior symbolic regression methods based on genetic programming or deep reinforcement learning. It also shows improved performance on discovering algebraic and differential equations compared to several baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is the vertical discovery path and modeling symbolic regression as a sequential decision making process for sampling grammar rules. This allows VSR-DPG to scale much better to equations with many variables compared to prior approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Vertical symbolic regression (VSR): A method to expedite the discovery of symbolic equations with many independent variables by building from reduced-form equations with fewer variables to full equations.

- Deep policy gradient: Using deep neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), trained with a policy gradient reinforcement learning objective to predict sequences of production rules to generate candidate symbolic expressions.

- Control variable experiments: Studying the relationship between input and output variables by holding some input variables constant to simplify the search space. Used in vertical symbolic regression. 

- Context-free grammar: Representing symbolic expressions using production rules from a context-free grammar. Allows converting rule sequences into expressions.

- Sequential decision making: Viewing the search for optimal symbolic expressions as a sequential process of predicting good production rules to apply using the RNN.

- Reduced hypothesis spaces: The initial spaces searched in vertical symbolic regression with fewer free variables are much smaller than the full space with all variables, enabling more efficient search.

- Scientific discovery: Symbolic regression is an important benchmark task for AI-driven scientific discovery to distill models and laws from experimental data.

In summary, the key idea is to use deep neural networks trained with reinforcement learning to efficiently search reduced symbolic expression spaces in a sequential manner following vertical discovery paths.
