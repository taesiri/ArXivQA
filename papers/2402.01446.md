# [Guidance Graph Optimization for Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies how to improve the throughput (average number of goals reached per timestep) of lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) by introducing global guidance for agent movements. Previous work has shown that incorporating guidance like highways can speed up MAPF algorithms but often results in lower solution quality. Also, how to automatically generate good guidance remains largely unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the directed guidance graph, which alters the costs of agents moving along graph edges and waiting at vertices. It frames Guidance Graph Optimization (GGO) as the task of optimizing the edge weights of this graph. Two GGO algorithms are presented:

1) CMA-ES: Directly solves GGO using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy, a black-box continuous optimizer. It iteratively samples guidance graphs, evaluates them in a simulator, and updates the sampling distribution towards high-throughput regions.

2) Parameterized Iterative Update (PIU): Optimizes an update model using CMA-ES. This neural network model starts with an unweighted graph and iteratively updates it using simulated traffic data. PIU allows transferring guidance graphs to larger maps.


Main Contributions:

1) Introducing the versatile guidance graph representation and GGO formulation to improve lifelong MAPF throughput

2) Providing an in-depth study of previous MAPF guidance works, analyzing their representation, generation, and usage

3) Proposing two automatic GGO methods - CMA-ES and PIU. Experiments show they outperform baseline guidance on 3 MAPF algorithms in 4 maps. PIU can transfer guidance to larger maps up to 93x91 with 3000 agents.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to automatically generate high-quality guidance for lifelong MAPF that enhances throughput. The guidance can be effectively transferred to larger similar maps as well.
