# [AnnoTheia: A Semi-Automatic Annotation Toolkit for Audio-Visual Speech   Technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13152)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of annotated audio-visual speech resources for most of the 7,000+ languages spoken globally, limiting the development of speech technologies for these languages. This inequality is further exacerbated for audio-visual speech tasks like lipreading and audio-visual speech recognition.
- Most existing audio-visual speech corpora and models are heavily benchmarked on English, highlighting the need to promote research on low-resource languages.  
- While prior works have presented data collection/annotation pipelines, no publicly available toolkit exists to facilitate this process.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present AnnoTheia - the first open-source, semi-automatic toolkit for annotating audio-visual speech data. 
- It detects speech activity, identifies the active speaker using face detection and audio-visual alignment, generates transcriptions using ASR, and provides an intuitive interface to annotate and collect data.
- The toolkit provides flexibility to replace its modules with user's custom components or ones adapted to their language of interest.

Key Contributions:
- Release of AnnoTheia - the first publicly available toolkit to accelerate annotation of audio-visual speech data and promote low-resource language research.
- Description of full process to adapt the toolkit to new languages by fine-tuning Active Speaker Detection (ASD), even without existing ASD datasets. 
- Presentation of RTVE-ASD - a new multi-speaker Spanish corpus for ASD collected from TV broadcasts and tailored to train ASD models.
- Experimental results demonstrating TalkNet-ASD model fine-tuned on RTVE-ASD can effectively detect active speakers on Spanish data.

In summary, the paper introduces an impactful toolkit to democratize audio-visual annotation and scaling of speech technologies to diverse languages. The modular nature and detailed language adaptation process significantly lower barriers to collecting diverse speech data.
