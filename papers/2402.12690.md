# [Simpson's Paradox and the Accuracy-Fluency Tradeoff in Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a debate about whether translation accuracy and fluency trade off against each other at the individual sentence level. Some argue they are positively correlated overall but negatively correlated for individual sentences, while others argue they are practically indistinguishable.

- This disagreement can be characterized as an instance of Simpson's paradox, where relationships at one level of analysis (corpus-level) are reversed at another (sentence-level).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors aim to establish that accuracy and fluency are negatively correlated at the sentence level for both human judgments and model estimates of accuracy and fluency.

- They simulate data showing accuracy and fluency trade off for lower probability sentence translations.

- Using translations from 3 corpora, they show accuracy and fluency judgments and model estimates are negatively correlated across individual sentences.

Main Contributions:
- Provides evidence that accuracy and fluency trade off at the sentence level but can be positively correlated overall due to Simpson's paradox.

- Suggests quality assessment protocols should assess accuracy and fluency independently.

- Proposes developing MT models that can navigate accuracy-fluency tradeoffs appropriately based on use case priorities.

In summary, the paper clearly establishes the accuracy-fluency tradeoff at the sentence level and discusses implications for translation quality assessment and improvement.
