# [On Sarcasm Detection with OpenAI GPT-based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Sarcasm detection in text is a challenging problem for both humans and AI due to the need to understand contextual and social cues. Prior machine learning models have struggled to accurately detect sarcasm. 

- This paper explores using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models for sarcasm detection, including fine-tuning and zero-shot approaches. Specifically, it tests different sized GPT-3, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models on the balanced political subset of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC) dataset.

Methodology 
- The models are evaluated using accuracy and F1-score on a dataset containing balanced sarcastic and non-sarcastic text examples.

- Fine-tuning is performed on GPT-3 models of increasing size. Zero-shot testing is performed on 14 GPT model variants. Prompt engineering is used to format the dataset for the models.

Results
- Fine-tuned: The largest GPT-3 model (davinci with 175B parameters) achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.81 and F1-score of 0.81 on the dataset, outperforming prior models.

- Zero-shot: Only the latest GPT-4 models can detect sarcasm reasonably well, with the best GPT-4 model achieving accuracy of 0.70 and F1-score of 0.75. Other models perform poorly.

- Model performance varies significantly between releases, highlighting the need to reassess with each new version.

Contributions
- First comparative study of fine-tuning vs zero-shot approaches for sarcasm detection across different releases of GPT models 

- State-of-the-art sarcasm detection performance using fine-tuned GPT-3 davinci model

- Analysis showing model performance differences for sarcasm detection across model sizes, versions, and learning approaches.
