# [ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool   Learning Across Three Stages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10753)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on addressing safety issues of large language models (LLMs) in the context of tool learning. Tool learning involves LLMs utilizing external APIs/tools to interact with the real-world, which enhances their capabilities but introduces new safety risks. The paper notes that current research emphasizes improving LLMs' tool usage abilities without adequately considering emerging safety considerations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces "ToolSword", a comprehensive framework to systematically uncover safety issues for LLMs across different stages of the tool learning process. ToolSword outlines six key safety scenarios spanning the input stage (receiving user queries), execution stage (selecting tools) and output stage (providing responses). These scenarios cover malicious user queries, noisy tool selections, harmful tool outputs etc. that can lead to unsafe LLM behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- Devises the first dedicated testing framework - ToolSword - to evaluate LLM safety issues in tool learning scenarios. The framework conducts multi-stage testing through meticulously designed safety scenarios.
- Evaluates 11 major open/closed-source LLMs using ToolSword reveals significant lingering safety gaps - even for advanced models like GPT-4 - in handling unsafe queries, selecting risky tools and generating harmful responses. 
- Highlights need to enhance safety considerations in tool learning research and provides benchmark to assess improvements. ToolSword data is released to further research.
- Additional studies indicate LLMs can perform to human levels in ideal tool learning settings, hence emphasizing that improving safety is vital to enable their practical usage.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution by systematically evaluating and revealing safety vulnerabilities of LLMs in tool learning contexts through ToolSword. The findings underline the pressing need to address safety issues to facilitate trustworthy deployment of LLMs leveraging tool learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ToolSword, a comprehensive framework for analyzing safety issues of large language models in tool learning across input, execution, and output stages, and experiments reveal enduring challenges like handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and providing detrimental feedback that even advanced models like GPT-4 still face.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing ToolSword, a comprehensive framework for unveiling the safety issues of large language models (LLMs) in tool learning across three stages: input, execution, and output. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios that LLMs encounter in tool learning: malicious queries and jailbreak attacks in the input stage; noisy misdirection and risky cues in the execution stage; and harmful feedback and error conflicts in the output stage.

2) Experiments are conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs to reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback. Even advanced models like GPT-4 are shown to be susceptible to these issues. 

3) Further studies indicate that while LLMs can perform comparably to humans in ideal tool learning environments, enhancing safety measures is imperative to enable their practical application.

In summary, ToolSword provides a thorough investigation into the safety risks of LLMs in tool learning to motivate further research on improving tool learning safety.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Tool learning - The paper focuses on investigating safety issues with large language models (LLMs) in the context of tool learning, which involves integrating LLMs with external tools. 

- Safety issues - The main goal of the paper is to analyze safety challenges and vulnerabilities faced by LLMs when using tools across three stages (input, execution, output).

- ToolSword framework - The authors introduce a comprehensive framework called "ToolSword" for systematically evaluating LLM safety across different scenarios in tool learning.

- Safety scenarios - Within each of the three stages of tool learning, the paper examines LLMs through two distinct safety scenarios (e.g. malicious queries, jailbreak attacks, noisy misdirection, etc.).

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper analyzes the tool learning safety issues with 11 different LLMs, including popular models like GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA, etc.

- Three stages - The tool learning process is divided into three stages (input, execution, output) and LLM safety is evaluated at each stage through specialized safety scenarios.

- Safety evaluation - Both quantitative metrics (e.g. attack success rates) and qualitative analysis are used to assess LLM vulnerabilities and challenges with respect to safety across different scenarios.

In summary, the key focus is on assessing safety considerations in tool learning for LLMs using the tailored ToolSword analysis framework across three key stages.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. ToolSword proposes six distinct safety scenarios across three stages of tool learning - input, execution, and output. Could you expand more on why analyzing safety issues at a granular, stage-wise level provides more meaningful insights compared to an end-to-end evaluation? 

2. The paper examines both unmodified malicious queries (MQ) and queries modified through jailbreaking techniques (JA). Between these two types of input-stage attacks, which one poses a greater safety threat currently? And what can be done to mitigate the more dangerous attack vector?

3. For the execution stage, tool selection errors due to noisy tool names (NM) and risky functional cues (RC) are tested. Between these two scenarios, which one showcases the greater deficiency in current LLMs' comprehension of tool functions and behaviors? How can this deficiency be addressed?  

4. The output stage analyzes harmful feedback (HF) and error conflicts (EC). Why is the ability to detect inconsistencies and rectify errors critical for safe tool learning? What mechanisms can enhance this capability in LLMs? 

5. The paper examines widely used models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Despite their advanced capabilities, what enduring safety issues do even these state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate per the ToolSword analysis?

6. An interesting observation is that model scale does not necessarily translate to better safety. What underlying reasons could explain this trend? How can safety be improved irrespective of model size?

7. Although vulnerable to attacks, error-free tool learning performance of LLMs can match or even exceed humans. What does this indicate about the current limitations and future potential of LLMs in tool learning contexts?

8. Beyond quantifying ASRs, are there other meaningful metrics that can be incorporated into ToolSword to provide a multidimensional perspective on safety? What kinds of metrics could prove useful?

9. ToolSword focuses exclusively on safety aspects of tool learning. To enable practical deployments, what other dimensions beyond safety warrant examination for LLMs in tool learning contexts?

10. What meaningful extensions can be incorporated into the ToolSword framework to expand the scope of safety analysis for tool learning going forward? What new tools, scenarios, or measurements could prove beneficial?
