# [EfficientSCI: Densely Connected Network with Space-time Factorization   for Large-scale Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10006)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to develop an efficient deep learning based method for high quality video reconstruction from snapshot compressive measurements. 

The key points are:

- Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a single 2D measurement to capture high-speed video frames. Efficient reconstruction algorithms are needed.

- Existing model-based methods are slow and produce poor quality. Learning-based methods have high complexity and cannot handle large-scale data. 

- This paper proposes an efficient end-to-end deep network called EfficientSCI using dense connections and space-time factorization for video SCI reconstruction.

- EfficientSCI establishes spatial-temporal correlation efficiently using convolution in space and Transformer in time.

- Experiments show EfficientSCI achieves state-of-the-art results and fast running speed. It can reconstruct UHD color video from a single measurement with PSNR above 32dB.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an efficient deep network leveraging dense connections and space-time factorization can achieve high performance video SCI reconstruction with low complexity. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EfficientSCI network.
