 The central research question is how to develop an efficient deep learning based method for high quality video reconstruction from snapshot compressive measurements. 

The key points are:

- Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a single 2D measurement to capture high-speed video frames. Efficient reconstruction algorithms are needed.
