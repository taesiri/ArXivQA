# [EfficientSCI: Densely Connected Network with Space-time Factorization   for Large-scale Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10006)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to develop an efficient deep learning based method for high quality video reconstruction from snapshot compressive measurements. 

The key points are:

- Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a single 2D measurement to capture high-speed video frames. Efficient reconstruction algorithms are needed.

- Existing model-based methods are slow and produce poor quality. Learning-based methods have high complexity and cannot handle large-scale data. 

- This paper proposes an efficient end-to-end deep network called EfficientSCI using dense connections and space-time factorization for video SCI reconstruction.

- EfficientSCI establishes spatial-temporal correlation efficiently using convolution in space and Transformer in time.

- Experiments show EfficientSCI achieves state-of-the-art results and fast running speed. It can reconstruct UHD color video from a single measurement with PSNR above 32dB.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an efficient deep network leveraging dense connections and space-time factorization can achieve high performance video SCI reconstruction with low complexity. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EfficientSCI network.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new deep learning network called EfficientSCI for video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction. The key innovations are using dense connections and space-time factorization within network modules to improve efficiency and performance.

2. It introduces two new network blocks:

- ResDNet block that uses hierarchical dense connections within a residual block to reduce model complexity while enhancing learning ability. 

- CFormer block that utilizes convolution in spatial domain and Transformer in temporal domain based on space-time factorization, to efficiently capture spatial-temporal correlations.

3. Extensive experiments show the proposed EfficientSCI method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real video SCI datasets. Notably, it is the first demonstration of reconstructing UHD color video with high compression ratio using a single end-to-end deep network. 

4. The method has very high efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to previous methods. It also has better real-time performance.

In summary, the key innovation is a highly efficient deep network architecture for high-quality video SCI reconstruction, with superior performance compared to prior arts. The efficiency enables reconstructing large-scale and high frame rate video data.
