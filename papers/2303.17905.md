# [3D-aware Image Generation using 2D Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17905)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper tries to address is: 

How can we develop a 3D-aware image generation method that leverages the modeling power of 2D diffusion models, while only requiring unstructured 2D image collections as training data?

The authors propose a novel approach to formulate 3D-aware image generation as a sequential unconditional-conditional multiview image generation process. This allows them to take advantage of the capabilities of 2D diffusion models for image distributions to tackle the 3D-aware generation problem. A core innovation is using estimated depth maps to construct multiview training data from unstructured image collections.

In summary, the paper introduces a new way to apply 2D diffusion models to 3D-aware image generation through a sequential sampling formulation. The key hypothesis is that this approach can achieve superior generative modeling performance on complex image datasets compared to prior 3D-aware GAN methods. Experiments on datasets like ImageNet seem to validate this hypothesis based on the results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new formulation for 3D-aware image generation as sequential unconditional-conditional multiview image sampling. This allows leveraging 2D diffusion models for the task.

- Developing a 3D-aware image generation method based on the proposed formulation that utilizes an unconditional diffusion model for the first view and a conditional diffusion model for novel views.

- Training the proposed method on both a large-scale multi-class dataset (ImageNet) and complex single-category datasets. The results show superior performance compared to prior 3D-aware GANs, especially on ImageNet.

- Demonstrating the capability to generate images under large view angles from unaligned training data, up to 360 degrees in some cases.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing a new formulation and approach for 3D-aware image generation based on diffusion models and sequential unconditional-conditional sampling. This allows the potent generative capabilities of diffusion models to be leveraged for the task while avoiding the need for 3D data. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on both large-scale and complex single-category datasets.
