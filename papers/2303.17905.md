# [3D-aware Image Generation using 2D Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17905)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper tries to address is: How can we develop a 3D-aware image generation method that leverages the modeling power of 2D diffusion models, while only requiring unstructured 2D image collections as training data?The authors propose a novel approach to formulate 3D-aware image generation as a sequential unconditional-conditional multiview image generation process. This allows them to take advantage of the capabilities of 2D diffusion models for image distributions to tackle the 3D-aware generation problem. A core innovation is using estimated depth maps to construct multiview training data from unstructured image collections.In summary, the paper introduces a new way to apply 2D diffusion models to 3D-aware image generation through a sequential sampling formulation. The key hypothesis is that this approach can achieve superior generative modeling performance on complex image datasets compared to prior 3D-aware GAN methods. Experiments on datasets like ImageNet seem to validate this hypothesis based on the results.
