# [Constructing Variables Using Classifiers as an Aid to Regression: An   Empirical Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In regression problems, there is often a need to manually engineer new explanatory variables that better describe the problem and enable the model to achieve better performance. This process is time-consuming.
- The paper aims to propose a method for automatically creating new variables that complement the information in the original input vector for regression problems.

Proposed Solution:
- Transform the regression problem into a classification problem by discretizing the target variable y into intervals using thresholds. 
- Define classes using these thresholds. Train classifiers to predict class membership. 
- Use the classifiers' outputs for each instance as new variables by concatenating them into a new feature vector X'.
- Train the regression model on the augmented dataset (original X + new X')

Key Points:
- Discretization done using Equal Frequency method into S intervals. S is a hyperparameter.
- Classify using Random Forests on S binary classification problems.
- Extract class probabilities from RF as new features X'.
- Tested on 33 regression datasets with 5 regressors - Linear regression, Decision tree, Random forest, XGBoost and Selective Naive Bayes
- Adding new features X' improves performance of 3 out of 5 regressors. Biggest gains for linear regression.
- Proposed method provides a generic way to enrich datasets for regression problems without needing domain expertise.

Main Contributions:
- A novel data augmentation technique to automatically construct new explanatory variables for regression problems by transforming the problem into a classification task.
- Detailed experimental analysis on 33 datasets validating the efficacy of the proposed technique in improving regression performance for several types of regressors.
