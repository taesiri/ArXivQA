# [Shapley-PC: Constraint-based Causal Structure Learning with Shapley   Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Causal structure learning (CSL) aims to extract causal relationships from observational data and represent them as graphs. This is an important step towards robust and transparent models that can estimate causal effects without requiring interventions. Constraint-based CSL methods use conditional independence tests to perform causal discovery but can make errors on finite samples. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel constraint-based CSL method called Shapley-PC that improves the discovery of causal orientations (v-structures) by analyzing conditional independence tests using Shapley values. Shapley values quantify the marginal contribution of a variable to the dependence between two other variables. This provides a principled way to determine which variable is more likely to be the collider in a v-structure based on its effect on the test statistics.

The proposed Shapley Independence Value (SIV) calculates a variable's marginal contribution to the p-value of the conditional independence test, averaged over different conditioning sets. Variables with the most negative SIV are most likely colliders. This decision rule is implemented within the PC-stable algorithm to orient v-structures.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of a new decision rule for v-structure orientation in constraint-based CSL using Shapley values (SIV)
- Proof that the soundness and asymptotic consistency guarantees of PC-algorithm are preserved
- Extensive evaluation showing improved performance over state-of-the-art constraint-based, score-based and functional causal model methods
- Analysis of performance wrt graph density and data-generating process, with consistent improvement across diverse scenarios

In summary, the paper presents a principled way to leverage more information from conditional independence tests to improve v-structure discovery. This enhances the overall causal graph extraction and demonstrates the value of applying concepts from cooperative game theory within causal discovery.
