# [ActiveRAG: Revealing the Treasures of Knowledge via Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13547)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from issues like hallucination and outdated knowledge, making their outputs unreliable. 
- Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models position LLMs as passive knowledge receptors, restricting their ability to actively learn and comprehend external knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ActiveRAG, an innovative RAG framework that enables LLMs to actively acquire knowledge through a 3-step pipeline - Retrieval, Knowledge Construction, and Cognition Nexus.

Knowledge Construction:
- Prompts LLM as 4 agents (Associate, Anchoring, Logician, Cognition) to construct knowledge understanding from different perspectives.
- Associate extracts familiar and advanced information to expand knowledge boundaries.  
- Anchoring establishes foundational understanding of unfamiliar concepts.
- Logician draws logical inferences to refine problem-solving abilities.
- Cognition aligns knowledge to prevent factual errors.

Cognition Nexus:  
- Fuses constructed knowledge outcomes with LLM's intrinsic chain-of-thought.
- Encourages LLM to reflect on and rectify errors in its reasoning process.
- Calibrates LLM's intrinsic cognition using external knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Shifts RAG from passive to active learning without fine-tuning LLM.
- Knowledge Construction methodology to develop deeper understanding. 
- Cognitive Nexus to incorporate knowledge construction into self-aware reasoning.
- Improves performance over baselines by 5% on QA datasets. 
- Robust to varying datasets and number of retrieved passages.
- Knowledge construction outcomes generalizable to different LLM architectures.

In summary, ActiveRAG enables LLMs to actively construct and utilize external knowledge through its novel Knowledge Construction and Cognitive Nexus techniques, enhancing their reasoning abilities.
