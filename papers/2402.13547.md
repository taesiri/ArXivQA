# [ActiveRAG: Revealing the Treasures of Knowledge via Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13547)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from issues like hallucination and outdated knowledge, making their outputs unreliable. 
- Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models position LLMs as passive knowledge receptors, restricting their ability to actively learn and comprehend external knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ActiveRAG, an innovative RAG framework that enables LLMs to actively acquire knowledge through a 3-step pipeline - Retrieval, Knowledge Construction, and Cognition Nexus.

Knowledge Construction:
- Prompts LLM as 4 agents (Associate, Anchoring, Logician, Cognition) to construct knowledge understanding from different perspectives.
- Associate extracts familiar and advanced information to expand knowledge boundaries.  
- Anchoring establishes foundational understanding of unfamiliar concepts.
- Logician draws logical inferences to refine problem-solving abilities.
- Cognition aligns knowledge to prevent factual errors.

Cognition Nexus:  
- Fuses constructed knowledge outcomes with LLM's intrinsic chain-of-thought.
- Encourages LLM to reflect on and rectify errors in its reasoning process.
- Calibrates LLM's intrinsic cognition using external knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Shifts RAG from passive to active learning without fine-tuning LLM.
- Knowledge Construction methodology to develop deeper understanding. 
- Cognitive Nexus to incorporate knowledge construction into self-aware reasoning.
- Improves performance over baselines by 5% on QA datasets. 
- Robust to varying datasets and number of retrieved passages.
- Knowledge construction outcomes generalizable to different LLM architectures.

In summary, ActiveRAG enables LLMs to actively construct and utilize external knowledge through its novel Knowledge Construction and Cognitive Nexus techniques, enhancing their reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes ActiveRAG, an innovative framework for retrieval augmented generation that shifts from passive knowledge acquisition to active learning by constructing knowledge understanding and integrating it with the model's intrinsic cognition to produce more accurate answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution is proposing ActiveRAG, an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that shifts from passive knowledge acquisition to an active learning mechanism for language models. Specifically:

1) ActiveRAG utilizes a Knowledge Construction mechanism to develop a deeper understanding of external knowledge by associating it with previously acquired or memorized knowledge. This aims to facilitate active learning without additional fine-tuning.

2) It designs a Cognitive Nexus mechanism to incorporate the outcomes from both the chain of thought and knowledge construction, calibrating the intrinsic cognition of language models to produce more accurate answers. 

3) Experiments using ChatGPT-3.5 show ActiveRAG improves performance over 5% on question answering datasets compared to previous RAG models. The knowledge construction outcomes also generalize to aid other models like LLaMA in leveraging external knowledge.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling more effective active knowledge learning to improve language models' reasoning and comprehension, without needing extra fine-tuning. The proposed ActiveRAG framework and its Knowledge Construction and Cognitive Nexus mechanisms are the main contributions.
