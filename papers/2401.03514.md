# [ROIC-DM: Robust Text Inference and Classification via Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03514)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Language models have made great progress on text classification and inference tasks but remain vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. Existing defense methods have limitations - adversarial training and detection require infeasible prior knowledge of attacks, while purification methods deteriorate performance on clean data. Improving language models' robustness via defense mechanisms is challenging.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Robust Text Inference and Classification Diffusion Model (ROIC-DM) built on the diffusion model framework. Diffusion models go through denoising stages during training, making them inherently more robust in estimating the data distribution. ROIC-DM modifies diffusion models to solve text classification/inference by conditioning the label denoising on the input text. It further incorporates knowledge from pre-trained language models as advisors to improve effectiveness and efficiency.  

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce diffusion models for text classification/inference tasks
- Proposed ROIC-DM achieves better performance and robustness than language models  
- Conducted extensive experiments on AG News, SST, and MRPC datasets demonstrating ROIC-DM's superiority:
  - More robust to textual attacks than language models even with advanced defenses
  - Comparable or better performance than language models by using them as advisors

In summary, the paper explores a new paradigm of utilizing diffusion models for robust text classification and inference via the proposed ROIC-DM framework. With innate robustness and integration of language models' knowledge, ROIC-DM advances the state-of-the-art in this domain.
