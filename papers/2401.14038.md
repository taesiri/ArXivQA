# [Deep Clustering with Diffused Sampling and Hardness-aware   Self-distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing deep clustering methods treat all samples equally, neglecting the variance in data distribution and difficulty in clustering different samples. They categorize samples into rigid positive/negative pairs with equal weights, causing sampling bias. How to balance contrastive and non-contrastive learning and alleviate sampling bias is still an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep clustering framework called HaDis, with the following key components:

1) Diffused Sampling Alignment (DSA): Enhances instance alignment by considering neighboring positive samples to improve intra-cluster compactness. 

2) Hardness-Aware Self-Distillation (HSD): Mines the hardest positive and negative samples, then corrects the bias for them adaptively in a self-distillation fashion to deal with sampling bias.

3) Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL): Conducts contrastive learning at prototype-level to enhance inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness.

Main Contributions:

1) A new deep clustering framework enjoying the strengths of both contrastive and non-contrastive learning, achieving well-concentrated intra-cluster and well-separated clusters.

2) Diffused Sampling Alignment to improve intra-cluster compactness by incorporating neighborhood information.

3) Hardness-Aware Self-Distillation to identify and correct bias for the hardest samples adaptively.

4) Incorporation of Prototypical Contrastive Learning to avoid clustering collapse and enhance efficiency.

5) State-of-the-art performance on 5 datasets, outperforming existing methods. The framework is end-to-end, pretraining-free and demonstrates robust clustering stability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep clustering framework called HaDis that enhances intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separability by aligning augmented views of images, adaptively reweighting hard samples, and contrasting prototypes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel end-to-end deep clustering framework called HaDis, which combines the benefits of both contrastive and non-contrastive learning while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, it does not rely on a large number of negative pairs, achieves well-concentrated intra-cluster compactness and well-separated clusters, and ensures robust clustering stability.

2. It proposes a diffused sampling alignment (DSA) method to enhance instance alignment by considering neighboring positive samples in the embedding space, aiming to improve intra-cluster compactness. 

3. It proposes a hardness-aware self-distillation (HSD) method to mitigate sampling bias by simultaneously mining the hardest positive and negative samples and then adaptively calibrating their weights in a self-distillation fashion.

4. By incorporating prototypical contrastive learning (PCL), the proposed HaDis framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on five challenging image clustering benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority and efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the novel HaDis framework that combines multiple novel techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple image clustering datasets.
