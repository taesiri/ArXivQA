# [Curricular Contrastive Regularization for Physics-aware Single Image   Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14218)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How to develop an effective deep learning framework for single image dehazing that improves interpretability through physics-based modeling and establishes a more concise solution space using consensual contrastive samples?

Specifically, the key questions/goals explored are:

- How to promote interpretability in the feature space for haze removal by incorporating physics-based priors? The paper proposes a physics-aware dual-branch unit (PDU) derived from the atmospheric scattering model to achieve this.

- How to construct a more compact solution space using contrastive samples? The paper proposes a novel curricular contrastive regularization using consensual negatives and a curriculum learning strategy to address this. 

- How to arrange the consensual negatives with varying difficulties during training? A self-contained curriculum learning method is introduced to handle this issue.

- How to combine the above ideas into an effective end-to-end deep network? The paper develops C^2PNet integrating the PDU and curricular contrastive regularization.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by enhancing interpretability through physics-based modeling and establishing a better-constrained solution space using consensual contrastive regularization, the paper aims to develop an improved deep learning approach for single image dehazing. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed C^2PNet.
