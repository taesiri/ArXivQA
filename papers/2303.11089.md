# [EmoTalk: Speech-Driven Emotional Disentanglement for 3D Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11089)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goal is to develop an end-to-end neural network for generating realistic 3D facial animations from speech that effectively convey emotions. The key hypotheses are:

1. Emotions are an essential aspect of human communication and facial expressions. Incorporating emotional information into 3D facial animations from speech can make them more realistic and avoid the uncanny valley effect. 

2. Speech contains inherent emotional information entangled with the speech content. Disentangling the emotion and content allows clearer emotional information to be extracted and adapted to facial expressions.

3. Facial blendshapes can be used as supervisory signals to reconstruct plausible 3D faces from 2D emotional audio-visual data. This enables building large-scale 3D emotional facial animation datasets for training.

4. An emotion disentangling encoder can separate emotion and content features from speech into distinct latent spaces. Cross-reconstruction of different combinations of emotion and content can enforce disentanglement. 

5. An emotion-guided decoder that fuses content, emotion, style, and level features can generate expressive 3D facial animations that match the emotion in the speech.

Overall, the main hypothesis is that disentangling emotion from speech and using it to guide facial animation generation can result in more realistic and emotionally expressive talking 3D faces compared to prior work. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed model, datasets, and experiments.
