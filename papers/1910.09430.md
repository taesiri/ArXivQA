# [Adversarial Skill Networks: Unsupervised Robot Skill Learning from Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09430)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn reusable skill embeddings from unlabeled video demonstrations that can be composed to solve new tasks?In particular, the authors aim to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view video demonstrations, without needing any correspondence between frames and task labels. The goal is for the learned embedding to enable training reinforcement learning agents to reuse previous skills for new tasks by using the embedding space as a reward function.To address this, the paper introduces Adversarial Skill Networks, which combines a metric learning loss that utilizes temporal video coherence with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill transfer loss. The key ideas are:- The metric learning loss learns a state representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. - The adversarial skill transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains by maximizing the entropy of a discriminator's outputs.- Using these losses jointly results in a versatile embedding space that represents skills in a task-independent way.- The learned embedding can then be used as a reward function to train RL agents to solve new tasks by composing and interpolating previously seen skills.So in summary, the central research question is how to learn a reusable, task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled videos that allows solving new tasks by skill composition, which they address using an adversarial learning framework with specific metric and entropy losses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Adversarial Skill Networks (ASN), a novel approach to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view videos. The key ideas are:- Combining a metric learning loss that utilizes temporal video coherence with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill-transfer loss. - The metric learning loss learns a disentangled state representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. - The adversarial skill-transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains.- Using an entropy regularization technique to ensure the learned skills are task-independent and versatile.- Showing that the learned embedding enables training reinforcement learning agents for novel tasks by composing previously seen skills, using the embedding space as a reward function.In summary, the main contribution is an unsupervised approach to learn a transferable, reusable skill embedding from unlabeled videos that can be used to guide RL agents to solve new tasks by skill composition, without needing manually engineered reward functions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work in unsupervised skill learning:- The main contribution is an unsupervised approach to learn a general, reusable skill embedding from unlabeled multi-view videos. This allows composing skills to solve new tasks.- It combines metric learning losses with an adversarial entropy regularization loss. The metric loss uses video coherence, while the adversarial loss aims to make the learned skills task-independent. - Most prior work has focused on learning representations for single tasks from video, like TCN. This paper aims to learn a multi-skill space to enable more transfer and interpolation between skills.- Other related work has used hierarchical RL or entropy maximization to get reusable skills, but relies on hand-engineered reward functions. This work is fully unsupervised.- The proposed method outperforms baselines like TCN and mfTCN on aligning multi-view videos of unseen tasks, showing it learns a better skill space.- They demonstrate the learned embedding can be used to train RL policies for new compositions of skills, by using distance in the space as a reward.- Overall, it moves beyond single-task video representation learning to multi-skill learning without labels. The adversarial loss and evaluations on skill interpolation seem novel compared to prior work.In summary, the key novelty is the unsupervised multi-skill learning and the adversarial approach to get a reusable embedding space. The results demonstrate these ideas allow better transfer and generalization compared to other self-supervised video representation methods.
