# [Scalable Continuous-time Diffusion Framework for Network Inference and   Influence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02867)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Studying continuous-time information diffusion is important for many applications. 
- When only diffusion traces (cascades) are available, network inference and influence estimation are two key problems.  
- Existing methods have limited scalability, only applicable to networks with a few thousand nodes.

Proposed Solution:
- Model diffusion as a continuous-time dynamical system, with each node as a particle. 
- Propose framework "FIM" to approximate diffusion propagation from cascades.
- Use FIM to estimate adjacency matrix and infer network.
- Develop sampling technique "SDTS" for efficient influence estimation.

Contributions:
- Model continuous-time diffusions via dynamical systems and propose scalable FIM framework.  
- Theoretically analyze approximation errors of FIM for network inference and influence estimation.
- FIM significantly improves state-of-the-art on network inference accuracy.
- Sampling technique SDTS boosts efficiency of influence estimation.  
- Experiments show superior scalability of FIM, applicable to networks with 10k nodes and 10k cascades. FIM is the only method that can handle such scale of real-world data.

In summary, the paper develops a highly scalable and effective framework FIM for modeling continuous-time diffusions and solving network inference and influence estimation. Key innovations are the dynamical system formulation and advanced sampling technique. Experiments demonstrate clear advantages of FIM over existing methods on both accuracy and efficiency.
