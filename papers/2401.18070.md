# [Do Language Models Exhibit the Same Cognitive Biases in Problem Solving   as Human Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18070)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There is increasing interest in using large language models (LLMs) as cognitive models to simulate human learning and decision making. However, it is important that LLMs exhibit similar cognitive biases as humans to be considered plausible models. 
- The paper specifically looks at whether LLMs demonstrate the same biases as children when solving math word problems across the different steps involved - comprehending the text, planning the solution, and executing the computations. Studying biases in children but not adults helps disentangle training data effects from other model factors.

Methodology  
- The paper breaks down word problem solving into 3 key steps as per the cognitive science literature - text comprehension, solution planning and solution execution. 
- It tests 3 well-established biases in children that map to difficulties in each of these steps - (i) consistency bias in understanding the textual relationships, (ii) transfer vs comparison bias in planning using different math concepts/relationships, and (iii) carry effect bias in executing arithmetic computations.
- The authors generate specialized word problem test sets to isolate each bias using a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline. This pipeline enables fine-grained control of linguistic, structural and numerical features of the problems.  
- Several neural models are tested on these datasets in zero-shot settings - base LLaMA, MiSTRAL and MiXTRaL as well as their instruction-tuned variants. The chain-of-thought prompting strategy is also explored.

Key Findings
- LLMs demonstrate human-like consistency bias and transfer vs comparison bias, indicating they share biases during text comprehension and solution planning steps.
- However, LLMs do not show carry effect bias in the solution execution step. The differences in their arithmetic mechanisms compared to humans likely explains this.
- Overall, the results contribute to better understanding where LLMs can and cannot currently model children's math problem solving behavior. The methodology also enables studying additional cognitive biases in LLMs in the future.

In summary, the key contribution is a methodology and experiments to systematically evaluate biases in LLMs against established cognitive biases in children across distinct math problem solving steps. The findings reveal LLMs exhibit similarities in the earlier steps but differences in the later numerical manipulation step.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies whether large language models exhibit similar cognitive biases to human learners when solving math word problems, finding evidence that they demonstrate human-like biases in text comprehension and solution planning but not in executing arithmetic computations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is an analysis of whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit similar cognitive biases to human learners when solving math word problems. Specifically, the authors:

- Propose a three-step model of the cognitive process involved in solving math word problems: (1) text comprehension, (2) solution planning, and (3) solution execution.

- Identify three specific cognitive biases that are well-established in the literature on how children solve math word problems: (i) consistency bias, (ii) transfer vs comparison bias, and (iii) the carry effect. 

- Develop a controlled problem generation pipeline to create math word problems tailored to test each of those cognitive biases in LLMs.

- Evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on problems generated by their pipeline and find evidence that LLMs demonstrate consistency bias and transfer vs comparison bias like humans, but do not exhibit the carry effect bias.

In summary, the key contribution is an analysis of the extent to which current LLMs reflect known human cognitive biases when solving math word problems, differentiated across the separate steps of comprehension, planning, and execution. The findings reveal some similarities but also a key difference in how LLMs approach arithmetic computations compared to human learners.

The paper examines whether large language models exhibit similar cognitive biases to human learners when solving math word problems. It breaks down the problem solving process into three main steps - text comprehension, solution planning, and solution execution. It then designs tests targeting specific biases that impact human performance at each step, like consistency bias, transfer vs comparison bias, and the carry effect. The paper analyzes these biases in several state-of-the-art LLMs to determine if they demonstrate analogous tendencies. The analysis relies on causal inference methods by estimating the conditional average treatment effect. Overall, the key terms reflect the models, biases, and methods involved in this analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper generates novel word problems specifically for testing cognitive biases in LLMs. What are some advantages and potential limitations of generating new problems rather than using existing human-annotated datasets?

2. The pipeline proposed enables control over features across multiple levels, including numerical, structural, and linguistic properties. What are some ways this fine-grained control could be leveraged for follow-up experiments probing additional cognitive biases?  

3. The consistency bias test relies on varying the linguistic form while keeping the underlying mathematical relationships fixed. What other linguistic variations could be tested in a similar manner to further analyze text comprehension in LLMs?

4. For the transfer vs comparison test, what hypotheses could be formed and tested regarding how the measured bias might correlate with number of reasoning steps or overall problem complexity? 

5. In analyzing the absence of a carry effect, the paper suggests LLMs may rely on different computational mechanisms for arithmetic than humans. What experiments could further probe the nature of these computational mechanisms in LLMs?

6. The paper focuses on studying biases prevalent in children during math problem solving. What would be some interesting cognitive biases to explore that manifest distinctly in adult human reasoning?

7. The generation pipeline incorporates templated text and error correction to transform logical forms into fluent word problems. How might this method be extended to produce a wider range of linguistic styles and formats?  

8. What potential confounders could be present when estimating the causal effects of linguistic and structural features on LLM performance? How might the problem generation approach help mitigate these?

9. The cognitive model used simplifies certain aspects of human problem solving like use of shortcuts or intermediate text representations. What enhancements to the conceptual model could better capture these facets?

10. The paper studies arithmetic word problems in English. How might the relative difficulties for both humans and LLMs change when formulated in other languages or incorporating more complex mathematical concepts?
