# [UniDexGrasp: Universal Robotic Dexterous Grasping via Learning Diverse   Proposal Generation and Goal-Conditioned Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a universal robotic dexterous grasping system that can generalize to grasping a wide variety of objects, including unseen object categories, in a realistic robotic setting with only point cloud observations. The key hypotheses are:1) Decomposing the dexterous grasping task into diverse grasp proposal generation and goal-conditioned policy execution stages can enable universal generalization.2) For grasp proposal generation, factorizing the rotation from the translation and articulation modeling using conditional normalizing flows can produce diverse and high-quality grasps. 3) For grasp execution, using teacher-student learning with state canonicalization and curriculum learning can enable the goal-conditioned policy to successfully grasp objects according to diverse goals.4) Integrating these grasp proposal and execution stages can achieve universal dexterous grasping that generalizes to thousands of object instances across hundreds of seen and unseen categories.Overall, the central research question is how to achieve universal dexterous grasping, and the key hypothesis is decomposing the problem and using conditional normalizing flows, goal-conditioned policies, and other innovations can enable universal generalization. The experiments aim to validate if this approach can work across thousands of object instances.
