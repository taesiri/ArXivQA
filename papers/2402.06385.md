## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Maia: A Real-time Non-Verbal Chat for Human-AI Interaction":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of modeling face-to-face communication for Human-AI interaction. Specifically, it focuses on developing a real-time non-verbal visual chat system that can recognize and respond to facial expressions and head movements during interactions. The challenges include the complexity of non-verbal communication without verbal cues, individual differences in expressions, the need for real-time processing to enable natural conversations, and the lack of existing work and data in this area.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an alternative to text chats for Human-AI interaction based solely on non-verbal communication using facial expressions and head movements. They introduce three approaches to transform an input video of the user's facial keypoints into an output sequence that animates their human-like 3D avatar called Maia: (1) An PCA-based approach that projects expressions onto a learned emotion space, adds noise for improvisation, and reconstructs output keypoints, (2) An unsupervised neural network that learns to distill emotional expressions guided by the PCA output, and (3) A baseline retrieval method that finds the most similar expressions from a database.

Main Contributions:
- First real-time system for non-verbal-only Human-AI chat that recognizes and responds to facial expressions
- Good performance in communicating emotions, validated through human evaluation
- Introduction of Maia, an animated 3D avatar that is driven by facial keypoints to interact in real-time
- A new dataset of facial expression videos depicting a variety of emotions
- Novel unsupervised Teacher-Student framework where PCA acts as teacher to train neural network student

The system aims to engage users in a natural, real-time, visual-only conversational interaction using emotional facial expressions and head movements. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the system's ability to convey recognizable emotional expressions.
