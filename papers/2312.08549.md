# [A COLREGs-Compliant Conflict Resolution Strategy for Autonomous Surface   Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) operating at sea need to avoid collisions with other vessels by following international maritime rules called COLREGs. 
- Existing collision avoidance methods for ASVs do not adequately address COLREGs compliance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new two-phase collision avoidance strategy called COMCORE that generates COLREGs-compliant trajectories for ASVs.

Phase 1: 
- Uses A* search to find an optimal path to the goal for each ASV individually, ignoring other ASVs.

Phase 2:
- Detects conflicts between ASV paths and resolves them by modifying trajectories to comply with COLREGs rules. 
- Classifies conflicts as Head-on or Crossing situations.
- Labels vessels as Give-way or Stand-on in Crossing conflicts.
- Modifies paths by inserting new waypoints while following COLREGs guidelines. 

Key Contributions:
- Novel COMCORE strategy that provides COLREGs-compliant collision avoidance for ASVs.
- Method to identify and resolve conflicts between ASV paths.
- Algorithms to classify conflicts, label vessels and modify trajectories for COLREGs compliance.  
- Demonstrated scalability in simulations with up to 10 vessels.
- Validated COMCORE strategy with experiments using a custom-built ASV on a lake.

In summary, the paper presents a complete collision avoidance solution tailored for maritime autonomous surface vehicles that adheres to international maritime regulations. The efficacy of the proposed COMCORE strategy is shown through extensive simulations and real-world tests.
