# [In-context Prompt Learning for Test-time Vision Recognition with Frozen   Vision-language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot generalization capabilities on downstream tasks. However, their performance degrades significantly when test inputs are drawn from different distributions. Fully fine-tuning CLIP for each new task is costly and risks destroying the knowledge within the pre-trained model. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel test-time adaptation method called In-Context Prompt Learning (InCPL) to adapt CLIP to new tasks using only a few in-context examples and the test sample. 

Key Ideas:
1) Employs a token network to translate text descriptions into visual prompts that the CLIP vision encoder can comprehend.

2) Constructs a test sample coupled with a few in-context image-label examples to provide task-specific context to CLIP.

3) Optimizes a context-aware unsupervised loss involving the test sample and in-context examples to learn a test sample-specific prompt. This allows adapting CLIP without fine-tuning the model itself.

4) Alternates between optimizing the visual and text prompts cyclically to better capture contextual information.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces the concept of in-context learning to effectively adapt pre-trained vision-language models using only a few examples.

2) Delves into effective translation of language descriptions into visual prompt initializations using a token network.

3) Designs a context-aware optimization strategy to integrate visual prompts with text prompts.

4) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across several downstream datasets through extensive experiments.

In summary, the paper proposes InCPL, a novel test-time adaptation approach to harness in-context examples to specialize a frozen CLIP model to new tasks seamlessly just using a few examples. This eliminates the need for extensive fine-tuning CLIP individually for countless downstream tasks.
