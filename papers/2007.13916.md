# [Demystifying Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning: Invariances,   Augmentations and Dataset Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:- What explains the recent performance gains of contrastive self-supervised learning methods like MoCo and PIRL on downstream tasks like object detection and image classification? The paper hypothesizes that these gains come mainly from occlusion invariance learned through aggressive cropping augmentations.- Do contrastive self-supervised methods learn all the necessary invariances for object recognition tasks? The paper hypothesizes that while these methods learn occlusion invariance, they are inferior at learning viewpoint and category instance invariance compared to supervised methods. - Are the aggressive cropping augmentations an ideal strategy for learning useful representations? The paper hypothesizes that the cropping relies heavily on dataset bias and may not be scalable to more complex datasets.- Can alternative data like videos be used to learn better viewpoint and deformation invariance? The paper proposes that leveraging temporal transformations in videos can help learn representations with higher viewpoint invariance in a self-supervised manner.In summary, the key hypotheses are around understanding why contrastive self-supervised learning works so well recently, analyzing the limitations of current approaches, and proposing videos as an alternative form of data to learn better representations. The experiments aim to verify if aggressive cropping indeed leads to occlusion invariance, and if videos can improve viewpoint invariance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Presenting a framework to evaluate invariances encoded in self-supervised visual representations. The invariances considered are viewpoint, occlusion, illumination, instance, etc. which are relevant for object recognition tasks.2. Using this framework to analyze two recent contrastive self-supervised learning methods - MoCo and PIRL. The analysis shows these methods achieve gains in occlusion invariance compared to supervised pretraining, but are inferior in terms of viewpoint and instance invariance. 3. Demonstrating through experiments that the gains of contrastive self-supervised learning rely heavily on the object-centric bias of datasets like ImageNet. When trained on a scene-centric dataset like MSCOCO, the representations have lower discriminative power.4. Proposing an alternative approach to improve invariances by leveraging naturally occurring transformations in videos through temporal correspondences between frames and regions. This approach is shown to achieve better viewpoint and instance invariance compared to MoCo trained on the same data.5. Showing improved performance of video-based self-supervised learning on downstream tasks like image classification and semantic segmentation compared to MoCo trained on frames.In summary, the paper provides an analysis framework to understand self-supervised visual representations and uses it to highlight strengths and weaknesses of current contrastive learning methods. It also proposes an alternative approach using videos that helps mitigate some of the weaknesses.
