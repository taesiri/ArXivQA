# [Understanding and Estimating Domain Complexity Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13487)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for systematically understanding and estimating the complexity of domains in an AI context. The key problem being addressed is that AI systems developed in simulated or closed-world environments often fail when transitioned to real-world, open-ended domains due to mismatches in complexity. 

The paper makes a key distinction between intrinsic (environment) complexity which is independent of the agent, and extrinsic (agent-dependent) complexity. It identifies components defining complexity across six spaces: environment, task solution, performance, goals, planning and skills. The environment space includes objects, agents, relationships, interactions and phenomena like events, goals and rules. The task solution space depends on possible state transitions and paths to achieve goals. The performance, goals and planning spaces relate to the agent's scoring, objectives and possible plans. The skills space covers the agent's capabilities.

The paper proposes three main measures for quantifying complexity:

- Dimensionality - the size of the problem and solution spaces 
- Sparsity - how thinly spread out the information is 
- Diversity - the variability and ambiguity in the domain

These measures can be applied to capture both intrinsic and extrinsic complexity across different domains. The measures are demonstrated on several case studies spanning planning, perception and data science. For example, dimensionality is measured via state transition graphs or feature spaces, sparsity using statistical measures like Gini index, and diversity via information entropy.

The main contribution is a general framework and computable measures for understanding domain complexity in a standardized, domain-independent manner. This can help manage difficulties when transitioning AI systems, predict performance drops, avoid bias, and strengthen inductive bias. The paper concludes by identifying open questions around connecting complexity to difficulty, applying the measures to complex systems, and distinguishing infinities of complexity.
