# [History Matters: Temporal Knowledge Editing in Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05497)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing knowledge editing (KE) methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on making the model memorize new knowledge, but ignore retaining relevant historical knowledge. This causes issues when historical knowledge becomes invalidated after editing.
- Two distinct KE scenarios exist: knowledge correction (of intrinsic model errors) and knowledge updating (due to evolving real-world dynamics). Current methods conflate these two scenarios and overwrite original knowledge.
- There is a need to preserve historical knowledge alongside new knowledge, in order to maintain proper temporal chronology and reasoning within the LLM.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces the task of Temporal Knowledge Editing (TKE) to edit knowledge with temporal dynamics, while retaining historical knowledge. 
- Constructs a benchmark called AToKe with datasets for single edit, multiple edits and extending edits of temporal facts.
- Proposes a simple and general framework called METO that enhances existing KE methods by: (i) extracting model's internal "model-time" knowledge, (ii) multi-editing both historical and new facts, and (iii) optimizing model's prediction of the time period of facts.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies issues with historical knowledge distortion in existing KE methods.
- First to define and construct benchmark for the TKE task to assess temporal knowledge editing.
- Proposes the METO framework that substantially improves performance of edited models in utilizing historical knowledge on the AToKe benchmark.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed temporal knowledge editing task and METO solution framework, and the major contributions around introducing and evaluating the TKE task.
