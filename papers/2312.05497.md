# [History Matters: Temporal Knowledge Editing in Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05497)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing knowledge editing (KE) methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on making the model memorize new knowledge, but ignore retaining relevant historical knowledge. This causes issues when historical knowledge becomes invalidated after editing.
- Two distinct KE scenarios exist: knowledge correction (of intrinsic model errors) and knowledge updating (due to evolving real-world dynamics). Current methods conflate these two scenarios and overwrite original knowledge.
- There is a need to preserve historical knowledge alongside new knowledge, in order to maintain proper temporal chronology and reasoning within the LLM.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces the task of Temporal Knowledge Editing (TKE) to edit knowledge with temporal dynamics, while retaining historical knowledge. 
- Constructs a benchmark called AToKe with datasets for single edit, multiple edits and extending edits of temporal facts.
- Proposes a simple and general framework called METO that enhances existing KE methods by: (i) extracting model's internal "model-time" knowledge, (ii) multi-editing both historical and new facts, and (iii) optimizing model's prediction of the time period of facts.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies issues with historical knowledge distortion in existing KE methods.
- First to define and construct benchmark for the TKE task to assess temporal knowledge editing.
- Proposes the METO framework that substantially improves performance of edited models in utilizing historical knowledge on the AToKe benchmark.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed temporal knowledge editing task and METO solution framework, and the major contributions around introducing and evaluating the TKE task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes the task of Temporal Knowledge Editing to evaluate knowledge editing methods on their ability to preserve historical knowledge, and introduces a benchmark AToKe and an editing framework METO that improves historical knowledge preservation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Categorizing knowledge editing scenarios, pointing out the issue that current methods corrupt historical knowledge, and validating it through experiments and analysis.

2. Being the first to propose the Temporal Knowledge Editing task, and publishing a benchmark AToKe for evaluating KE methods in historical knowledge preservation, by collecting series of world knowledge with timestamps. 

3. Proposing a new editing framework METO that improves the performance of previous editing methods on the AToKe benchmark by editing both historical and new knowledge and optimizing the model's prediction for the time of each fact.

So in summary, the key contributions are identifying an issue with existing knowledge editing methods (corrupting historical knowledge), formally defining the task of Temporal Knowledge Editing to address this issue, creating a benchmark to evaluate methods on this task, and proposing a new editing framework (METO) that better handles historical knowledge preservation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Temporal Knowledge Editing (TKE) - The paper introduces and defines this new task of editing knowledge in language models while preserving temporal/historical information.

- AToKe - The name of the benchmark dataset introduced in the paper to evaluate TKE methods. It has three subsets - AToKe-SE, AToKe-ME, and AToKe-EE.

- Historical knowledge - The knowledge that used to be true in the past but has now changed, which needs to be preserved while editing new knowledge. 

- Current knowledge - The updated, true knowledge that needs to be injected into the language model.

- Knowledge editing (KE) - The general task of modifying, correcting or updating the knowledge stored in large language models. 

- Catastrophic forgetting - The phenomenon where neural networks lose previously learned knowledge upon learning new information. Existing KE methods exhibit this with historical knowledge.

- METO - The proposed editing framework to enhance existing KE methods, which edits for both historical and current knowledge.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new framework called METO that enhances existing knowledge editing methods. Can you explain in more detail how METO works and how it helps improve historical knowledge preservation?

2. The key innovation of METO seems to be optimizing the time prediction objective in addition to editing the target knowledge. Why is optimizing time prediction important for temporal knowledge editing? How does it help alleviate catastrophic forgetting?

3. The paper argues that existing knowledge editing methods conflate two distinct categories of edits - knowledge correction and knowledge updating. Can you elaborate more on the differences between these two types of edits and why it's important to differentiate them?  

4. METO edits both the current/new knowledge and the historical/old knowledge. What is the rationale behind editing historical knowledge as well and how does this help improve performance?

5. The paper introduces relative time questions (e.g. using "previous", "last one") and explicit time questions. Why are relative time questions more challenging for edited models compared to explicit time questions? 

6. Can you discuss the trade-offs involved in editing only the current model-time knowledge versus editing the full previous knowledge? What are the potential limitations of editing only model-time knowledge?

7. The performance of models degraded slightly from single-edit to multi-edit scenarios. What factors contribute to this degradation and how can it be minimized?

8. How suitable is METO for very long temporal knowledge chains spanning decades? Would the framework need to be modified to handle such cases well? 

9. Could incorporating structured temporal knowledge representations like Timely YAGO help METO perform better? What adaptations would be needed?

10. The paper identifies temporal knowledge editing as a challenging task. What future research directions seem most promising to substantially move the needle on this task?
