# [Relevance Feedback with Brain Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05669)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Relevance feedback (RF) is an important technique to improve search quality by acquiring additional signals about users' preferences beyond the initial query. However, existing RF signals like pseudo-relevance signals and implicit feedback signals (e.g. clicks) have limitations - pseudo-relevance signals rely on the initial search quality and implicit signals can be biased or inaccurate. The paper explores the potential of using brain signals captured from EEG as an additional RF signal to address these limitations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel RF framework that combines pseudo-relevance signals, click signals and brain signals for document re-ranking. The framework supports two RF settings - iterative RF (IRF) which dynamically reranks results as more signals are gathered, and retrospective RF (RRF) which reranks after search ends. 

The core ideas are:
(1) Transform different signals into base relevance scores independently. For brain signals, they train a decoder to map EEG responses to relevance scores.
(2) Combine base scores into relevance scores for IRF and RRF using tuned weights.
(3) For IRF, use combined scores to expand query and rerank upcoming docs. For RRF, directly rerank historical docs.  

The paper also proposes an adaptive combination method to dynamically adjust weights for brain, click and pseudo signals based on the search scenario.

Contributions:

(1) Propose and evaluate a novel RF framework incorporating brain signals captured from EEG, demonstrating brain signals can significantly improve RF performance.

(2) Analyze specific search scenarios like no clicks and bad clicks where brain signals are more beneficial than biased click signals, highlighting when and how to exploit brain signals.

(3) Propose an adaptive method to combine RF signals by modeling possible search scenarios. Show adaptive combination can further improve IRF performance.

Overall, the paper provides a novel perspective on leveraging real-time brain signals for RF to address limitations of existing signals. The analysis offers insights into scenarios where brain signals are most valuable in improving search relevance.
