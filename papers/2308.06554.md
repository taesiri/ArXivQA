# [Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation on Monocular Video for 3D Human Mesh   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06554)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we adapt a 3D human mesh reconstruction model to a new test domain, where there is a gap between the training data and test data, in order to improve performance on the test data? The key hypothesis is that iteratively adapting both a human mesh reconstruction network and a human motion denoising network in a cyclic fashion will allow for progressively improving supervision targets and 3D reconstructions on the test data.In summary, the paper focuses on test-time adaptation for 3D human mesh reconstruction to address the domain gap between training and test data distributions. The proposed cyclic adaptation framework between two networks is hypothesized to generate better supervision targets and reconstructions compared to relying solely on 2D evidence from the test data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing CycleAdapt, a novel test-time adaptation framework for 3D human mesh reconstruction to mitigate the domain gap between training and test data. The key points are:- The framework consists of two networks - a human mesh reconstruction network (HMRNet) and a human motion denoising network (MDNet). These two networks are iteratively adapted in a cyclic fashion on the test video.- In the HMRNet adaptation stage, HMRNet is fully supervised with 3D supervision targets generated from MDNet, along with 2D evidence like keypoints. This alleviates reliance on imperfect 2D evidence. - In the MDNet adaptation stage, MDNet is updated in a self-supervised manner to improve motion denoising on the test domain.- As the cycle repeats, MDNet produces progressively reliable 3D supervision targets for HMRNet, which results in improved HMRNet outputs. This cyclic process elaborates the supervision targets and prevents erroneous adaptation.- Experiments show the proposed CycleAdapt framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods for 3D human mesh reconstruction, both qualitatively and quantitatively.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the cyclic adaptation framework with two networks that progressively elaborate supervision targets to overcome issues with reliance on imperfect 2D evidence during test-time adaptation. This enables more accurate 3D human mesh reconstruction compared to prior arts.
