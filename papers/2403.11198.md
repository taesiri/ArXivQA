# [Learning-Based Wiping Behavior of Low-Rigidity Robots Considering   Various Surface Materials and Task Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Wiping motions need to adjust force and posture based on varying contact conditions. Prior work handles only single surface materials and lacks intelligence to check if force is evenly distributed.  
- Most prior work uses high-rigidity robots that are easy to model but have higher damage risk. Using low-rigidity robots is challenging.
- Objectives are to realize wiping motions that work on various surfaces, enable different task definitions, using a low-rigidity robot.

Method:
- Use a Tactile Transition Network with Parametric Bias (TTNPB) to model state transitions of a tactile sensor during wiping motions of a low-rigidity MyCobot robot.
- Collect data by adding noise to proportional control actions. Train network to capture MyCobot's softness and rattling.   
- Use parametric bias self-organization to classify surface materials without labels. Update bias online to adapt to current surface.
- Define loss functions on contact forces for different tasks - evenly distribute force, vary force directionality.

Experiments:
- Train on 5 materials, test on 4 known and 1 unknown material. Parametric bias automatically separates materials by surface friction and softness. Online update recognizes current material.
- Define 3 loss functions for different tasks. Learning based control outperforms fixed controller. Correct surface recognition is needed for good performance.

Contributions:
- Handles multiple surface materials through parametric bias self-organization without manual labeling
- Achieves different wiping behaviors by changing loss functions on contact forces
- Demonstrates approach on actual low-rigidity robot which is challenging to control precisely
- Limitations are instability with complex controls, restriction to 2D surfaces.

In summary, the paper presents a learning based approach using tactile sensing and parametric bias to achieve flexible wiping behaviors on different materials with a low-rigidity robot. Key contributions are in multi-surface handling and task definitions.
