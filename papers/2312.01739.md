## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel divide-and-conquer strategy to address the challenge of large-scale Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) structure learning. The existing Partition-Estimation-Fusion (PEF) strategy for static Bayesian Network structure learning is enhanced and adapted for the learning of 2-Time-sliced Bayesian Networks (2-TBNs), a type of DBN. Specifically, prior knowledge of 2-TBNs is incorporated to improve the fusion step when learning the transition model structure. Experiments on large synthetic datasets with over 1000 variables validate the effectiveness of this strategy. Compared to directly applying the base algorithm PC-Stable, the proposed approach boosts structure learning accuracy by 74.45% and 110.94% on two metrics respectively, while reducing runtime by 93.65% on average. Hence it significantly enhances the scalability and accuracy of 2-TBN structure learning. The modular nature also allows easy integration with different base algorithms. Overall, this work successfully adapts the divide-and-conquer principle to enable efficient and accurate causal structure learning from large-scale temporal data.
