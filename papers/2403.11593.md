# [End-to-end multi-modal product matching in fashion e-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11593)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Paper addresses the problem of product matching in e-commerce, specifically matching fashion items across multiple online retailers/sellers. Goals are to identify duplicate product listings to improve discoverability, pricing, recommendations etc.
- Key challenge is handling distribution shift across retailers in how products are visually represented (images) and described (titles, text), making precise matching difficult. Also scale and volume pose issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use a multi-modal neural encoder, "fashionID", to jointly encode images and text into a common embedding space where distance correlates with product similarity. Enables subsequent nearest neighbor retrieval.
- Encoder combines off-the-shelf pretrained CLIP image encoder and text encoder, with shallow learned projection head. Leverages transfer learning rather than full fine-tuning. Less costly to train.
- Train projection via large-batch contrastive learning objective using matched/non-matched offer pairs. No explicit hard negative mining needed.
- Also add simple numerical features like price. Show minor gains from this multi-modal fusion vs single modalities.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art product matching with simple contrastive learning on frozen CLIP embeddings, outperforming tuned baselines. Generalizes well to unseen test distribution.
- Analysis and comparison showing CLIP substantially outperforms DINO for visual product matching task, against expectations.
- Optimization experiments around removing lone negatives from training, role of large batch size etc. Provide recipe for this transfer approach.
- Demonstration of optimized human-in-the-loop validation stage to further improve precision to levels required for production systems. Characterize impact.
