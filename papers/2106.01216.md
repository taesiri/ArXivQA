# [Evidential Turing Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01216)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a model that combines the complementary strengths of parametric and evidential Bayesian models can simultaneously quantify model misfit, class overlap, and domain mismatch. Specifically, the paper proposes that a "Complete Bayesian Model" that has both global parameters like a parametric Bayesian model and local variables like an evidential model will excel at:- Quantifying model misfit by providing shrinking posterior variance like a parametric model. This allows assessing model fit.- Quantifying class overlap by expressing irreducible model uncertainty and data uncertainty like an evidential model. This allows assessing risk in areas of class overlap.  - Detecting domain mismatch by modulating predictions via a global variable like a parametric model. This allows identifying out-of-domain inputs.The paper introduces the "Evidential Turing Process" as an optimal realization of a Complete Bayesian Model that combines these strengths. The central hypothesis is that this model will demonstrate superior performance at quantifying all three types of uncertainty compared to just parametric or just evidential models.
