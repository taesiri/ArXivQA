# [Self-Supervised Model Adaptation for Multimodal Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we enable convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation to dynamically adapt the fusion of multimodal features in an optimal, self-supervised manner according to factors like object category, spatial location, and scene context?The key hypothesis appears to be that explicitly modeling the correlation between multimodal feature maps before fusion will allow the network to selectively emphasize the most informative features from each modality while suppressing less useful features. This should lead to more effective exploitation of complementary multimodal information compared to naive fusion techniques like concatenation. The authors propose a Self-Supervised Model Adaptation (SSMA) approach with a novel SSMA block that recalibrates and fuses modality-specific feature maps in a probabilistic, activation-driven way. By learning the fusion adaptively in a self-supervised fashion, the goal is to make the multimodal segmentation model more robust to different environments, conditions, and modalities.In summary, the central research question is how to enable optimal, dynamic, self-supervised adaptation of multimodal fusion in CNNs for semantic segmentation. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling feature correlations will allow selective emphasis of useful complementary features from each modality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a multimodal semantic segmentation framework that incorporates Self-Supervised Model Adaptation (SSMA) blocks for adaptive fusion of features from different modalities. The main contributions are:- The SSMA fusion blocks dynamically adapt the fusion of modality-specific features based on the object category, spatial location, and scene context in a self-supervised manner. This allows the model to selectively emphasize the most relevant complementary information from each modality.- An attention mechanism is introduced to better correlate the fused mid-level encoder features with high-level decoder features for improved boundary refinement.- A computationally efficient unimodal segmentation architecture called AdapNet++ is proposed. It uses multiscale residual units, an efficient Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and a strong decoder with skip refinements. This enables high performance with fewer parameters and faster inference.- A holistic network pruning approach is presented to further compress the model for efficient deployment. - The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks including Cityscapes, Synthia, SUN RGB-D, ScanNet, and Freiburg Forest. It shows exceptional robustness in adverse conditions compared to prior arts.In summary, the main contribution is a multimodal segmentation framework that can dynamically and adaptively fuse features from different modalities in a self-supervised manner to exploit complementary information. This leads to improved performance and robustness compared to prior fusion techniques.
