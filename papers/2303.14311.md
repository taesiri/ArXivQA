# [Learned Two-Plane Perspective Prior based Image Resampling for Efficient   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research hypothesis of this paper is that incorporating geometric constraints about a 3D scene into neural networks for object detection can improve detection performance, especially for small, distant objects. Specifically, the authors propose modeling the geometry of two dominant planes in driving scenes - the ground plane and a plane above it - in order to construct an image warping approach that enlarges distant objects along these planes. Their key hypothesis is that this geometry-guided image warping will enable more accurate and efficient detection of small, distant objects compared to prior methods.

The key points are:

- Incorporating 3D geometric scene constraints into neural nets can improve object detection, especially for small objects

- Modeling two dominant planes in driving scenes (ground and a plane above it) provides a useful geometric prior

- Using this geometric model to warp images and enlarge distant objects improves detection of small objects

- Their proposed learned two-plane perspective prior outperforms prior methods, especially for detecting small, distant objects in driving scenes

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling basic 3D scene geometry can guide an image warping approach to improve detection of small, distant objects compared to prior work. The two-plane geometric model captures a strong prior for many driving scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a learnable geometry-guided prior that incorporates rough 3D scene geometry (a ground plane and a plane above) to resample images for more efficient object detection. 

2. This resampling method significantly improves the detection of small and far-away objects, while also being more efficient in terms of latency and memory usage.

3. For autonomous navigation, using the same detector and image scale, the proposed method improves the detection rate of small objects by +4.1 AP_S (39%) and real-time performance by +5.3 sAP_S (63%) over state-of-the-art methods.

4. For fixed traffic cameras, the proposed method detects small objects at image scales where other methods fail. At the same scale, it improves small object detection by 195% (+12.5 AP_S) over naive downsampling and 63% (+4.2 AP_S) over state-of-the-art.

5. The proposed perspective prior generalizes well to new camera viewpoints and enables efficient city-scale sensing applications on resource-constrained edge devices.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel learned image resampling approach guided by geometric scene priors that significantly improves small object detection accuracy and efficiency for autonomous driving and traffic monitoring applications. The resampling allows detecting smaller objects by "zooming in" on faraway regions in the image.
