# [Arrange, Inpaint, and Refine: Steerable Long-term Music Audio Generation   and Editing via Content-based Controls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive models like MusicGen focus on music generation but lack capabilities for music editing tasks like inpainting, refinement, and arrangement. 
- Existing music inpainting models struggle to capture long-term dependencies and lack content-based controls.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce AIRGen, a model for arrangement, inpainting and refinement of music audio by fine-tuning MusicGen.
- Propose a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method with heterogeneous adapters to transform the autoregressive MusicGen into a masked language model capable of inpainting.
- Integrate frame-level content-based controls like drum tracks, chord progressions and piano covers during fine-tuning to enable track-conditioned refinement and score-conditioned arrangement.

Main Contributions:
- Parameter-efficient heterogeneous adapter that converts an autoregressive LM into a steerable masked LM for music inpainting.
- Model demonstrates flexible long-term music editing capabilities including segment inpainting, track-conditioned refinement and score-conditioned arrangement.
- High-quality steerable generation comparable to unconditional generation, outperforming inpainting baselines.
- Model is robust, supporting 70% masking rates. Fine-tuning requires under 20M parameters and 75MB storage space.
- Quantitative experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world vocal datasets demonstrate effectiveness across metrics like Fréchet Audio Distance and controllability metrics.

In summary, the paper proposes a method to transform an autoregressive music model into one capable of long-term context modeling for music editing tasks with content-based control, demonstrating strong quantitative performance and qualitative sample quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method to transform the autoregressive music audio model MusicGen into a steerable long-term music editing model capable of arrangement, inpainting, and refinement via content-based controls.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that enables the autoregressive music generation model MusicGen to perform non-autoregressive tasks like music inpainting while retaining its high generation quality. 

2. The integration of frame-level content-based controls like drum tracks, chord progressions, and piano covers during the fine-tuning process. This allows the model to perform conditional generation tasks like track-conditioned music refinement and score-conditioned music arrangement.

3. Experimental results demonstrating the model's capabilities in long-term music editing/inpainting, controllable inpainting with different types of audio controls, and arrangement/refinement from symbolic score representations. The model shows improved performance over baseline methods on metrics like Fréchet Audio Distance and Source-to-Distortion Ratio.

In summary, the key innovation is a PEFT method that equips the MusicGen model with non-autoregressive music editing abilities while allowing precise content-based audio controls. This improves flexibility for future AI-driven music editing tools.
