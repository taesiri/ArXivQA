# [AntGPT: Can Large Language Models Help Long-term Action Anticipation   from Videos?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16368)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can large language models (LLMs) help with long-term action anticipation (LTA) from videos, both for bottom-up prediction by modeling temporal dynamics and top-down prediction by inferring goals? 2. What is a good interface between videos and LLMs for the LTA task? Can simply representing videos as sequences of recognized action labels work?3. Can LLMs infer goals from observed actions, and are these goals helpful for top-down LTA?4. Do LLMs capture useful prior knowledge about temporal dynamics of actions that is helpful for bottom-up LTA? 5. Can LLMs leverage their in-context learning capability to perform few-shot LTA?To summarize, the overarching hypothesis seems to be that LLMs can help with LTA in both bottom-up and top-down paradigms, by inferring goals and leveraging knowledge about action dynamics and procedures. The paper explores different ways of applying LLMs, including fine-tuning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting. The experiments aim to quantify the benefits and understand the limitations of using LLMs for video-based LTA.

Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes AntGPT, a framework that uses large language models like GPT for long-term action anticipation in videos by modeling temporal dynamics in a bottom-up approach and inferring goals in a top-down approach, and shows it achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA GAZE+ benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in long-term action anticipation:- The paper proposes a novel two-pronged approach combining bottom-up and top-down modeling. Most prior work has focused solely on bottom-up approaches that directly model temporal dynamics. Inferring and utilizing high-level goals is a relatively underexplored area. - The use of large language models for goal inference and temporal modeling is innovative. LLMs have shown promise on related tasks like visual reasoning, but have not been extensively applied to long-term action anticipation. The results demonstrate LLMs can effectively leverage their pretraining on procedural text.- Representing videos as discrete recognized action labels provides a simple but effective interface between visual inputs and LLMs. Alternative representations like video/frame embeddings remain unexplored.- The paper provides one of the most thorough empirical analysis on design choices for LLMs on an action anticipation task. The ablations on prompting strategies and model variations yield useful insights.- The proposed AntGPT framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging LTA benchmarks. The gains are substantial compared to prior work, demonstrating the promise of this approach.- Limitations of the work are the accuracy of recognized actions and inferred goals. Thepaper acknowledges these issues and provides suggestions for future improvements.Overall, the novelty of the approach, extensive experiments, strong results, and detailed analysis help push forward research in long-term action anticipation. The paper outlines several interesting directions to build on this work, like exploring multimodal representations and more accurate goal modeling.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Improving the accuracy and quality of the predicted goals. The paper shows through counterfactual experiments that the choice of goal has a big impact on the predicted actions. So improving goal inference could lead to better action anticipation.- Considering multiple plausible goals instead of just one goal. Humans often have multiple intents when performing actions, so modeling multiple goals could make the anticipation more realistic. - Exploring alternative approaches to represent videos, such as via video captioning or object detection, instead of just recognized action labels. The visual details lost in the action label representation may help with certain tasks.- Further optimizing the prompt design strategies for in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting. The paper found performance is quite sensitive to prompt formulation.- Applying the framework to other related tasks such as next action prediction and embodied navigation. The paper focuses on long-term action anticipation but the approach could generalize.- Improving the action recognition accuracy which is currently a performance bottleneck. More accurate input actions to the language model could improve overall anticipation.- Exploring other multimodal learning techniques to "distill" knowledge from language models to vision-based models.So in summary, the main directions are improving goal inference, exploring alternative video representations, optimizing prompting strategies, and transferring language knowledge to improve vision models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes AntGPT, a framework to incorporate large language models (LLMs) for long-term action anticipation (LTA) from videos. LTA aims to predict an actor's future actions over a long horizon given observed video frames. The authors formulate LTA using bottom-up and top-down approaches. The bottom-up approach directly models temporal dynamics to predict future actions autoregressively. The top-down approach first infers the actor's goal, then performs goal-conditioned procedure planning to anticipate future actions. AntGPT represents videos as sequences of discretized action labels generated by a vision module. It then feeds these to LLMs like GPT-3 to perform goal inference, temporal modeling, and anticipatory sequence generation via techniques like fine-tuning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting. Experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA benchmarks show AntGPT achieves state-of-the-art LTA performance. The authors also demonstrate LLMs can infer goals from observations and perform counterfactual prediction given different goals. Overall, this work shows the promise of leveraging LLMs' world knowledge and few-shot capabilities for long-term video anticipation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes AntGPT, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for long-term action anticipation (LTA) from videos. LTA involves predicting an actor's future actions over a long horizon given observations of their current actions. The authors formulate LTA from two perspectives - bottom-up, which directly models the temporal dynamics, and top-down, which first infers the actor's goal then plans the actions to achieve it. AntGPT has two stages - it first recognizes actions from video frames using a supervised model, then feeds the recognized actions as text to the LLM to predict future actions or infer goals. For bottom-up LTA, AntGPT fine-tunes or performs few-shot learning with the LLM to autoregressively predict future actions. For top-down, it prompts the LLM to infer goals from observations, then performs goal-conditioned prediction. Experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens and EGTEA show AntGPT achieves state-of-the-art, and demonstrate the LLM can successfully infer goals, perform goal-conditioned planning, and few-shot anticipation. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length action representations and empirical prompt design.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes AntGPT, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for long-term action anticipation (LTA) from videos. The method represents videos as sequences of recognized action labels, which serve as inputs to the LLM. For bottom-up LTA, the LLM is fine-tuned or prompted to autoregressively predict future actions based on the observed actions. For top-down LTA, the LLM first infers the goal from the observed actions via in-context learning, and then performs goal-conditioned prediction of the future actions. The framework allows investigating the capabilities of LLMs for modeling temporal dynamics and leveraging goal information. Experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens and other datasets demonstrate AntGPT's state-of-the-art performance for LTA. Ablations reveal insights on design choices like video representation, prompting strategies, and the benefits of LLMs over transformers.
