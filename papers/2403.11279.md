# [Hybrid Feedback for Three-dimensional Convex Obstacle Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of safe navigation for a spherical robot with dynamics modeled as a single integrator in three-dimensional environments cluttered with arbitrarily-shaped, convex obstacles. The obstacles can have non-smooth boundaries and be placed arbitrarily, provided certain separation conditions are met. The objective is to design a control strategy that steers the robot from any initial location in the free workspace to a target location while avoiding collisions with the obstacles and ensuring the target location is globally asymptotically stable.

Solution:
The authors propose a hybrid feedback control scheme that operates by switching between two modes - a "move-to-target" mode and an "obstacle-avoidance" mode. 

In the "move-to-target" mode, the control input steers the robot directly towards the target location. If an obstacle obstructs this path, the robot transitions to the "obstacle-avoidance" mode when it enters a "landing region" around the obstacle. 

In the "obstacle-avoidance" mode, the control input makes the robot navigate in a circle around the obstacle, confined to a hyperplane passing through the target location and tangent to the obstacle's surface at the "hit point". This prevents the robot from getting stuck circling the obstacle. The robot switches back to the "move-to-target" mode upon entering an "exit region" where its path towards the target is clear. 

By appropriately constructing the jump conditions between modes, the control strategy ensures the robot avoids collisions and the target location is globally asymptotically stable from any initial condition, despite the discontinuous vector fields.

The authors also provide a procedure to implement the control strategy in unknown environments by using sensor measurements. Simulations validate the proposed approach.

Main Contributions:
- A hybrid feedback control scheme for safe navigation and global convergence to target for robot in 3D environments with general convex obstacles.
- Guaranteed satisfaction of separation conditions using a hysteresis-based construction of jump sets between modes. 
- Demonstration of global asymptotic stability for the target location.
- An implementation procedure relying solely on sensor measurements, enabling extension to unknown environments.
