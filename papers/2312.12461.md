# [Bird Movement Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks to   Prevent Bird Strikes with Low Altitude Aircraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Bird strikes (collisions between birds and aircraft) are a growing threat to aviation safety and cost the industry millions in damages annually. Emerging low-altitude air mobility aircraft are especially vulnerable.  
- Most prior research has focused on analyzing factors influencing bird strikes, but little on actually predicting bird movement to minimize probability of strikes. Accurate bird movement prediction is critical for flight planning to avoid intersections with aircraft trajectories.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict latitude and longitude of bird movement with high accuracy. LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data like bird tracks.
- Test four LSTM variants (vanilla, stacked, bidirectional, encoder-decoder) on real pigeon movement data and compare to linear and nonlinear regression benchmarks.
- Pick a practical 30 second prediction horizon - time for an aircraft to takeoff - for using predictions in flight planning. Assume 5 minute input horizon based on tracking limitations of avian radar.  

Key Contributions:
- LSTM models achieve under 100 meter error in predicting pigeon movement, significantly outperforming regression models with 1000s of meters of error. Demonstrates viability for flight planning.
- Provide insights on training data coverage, testing on unlabeled data, short vs long term predictions with LSTM models. 
- Show example of delaying aircraft departure by a few seconds based on predicted bird trajectory to avoid strike, demonstrating usefulness in practice.

In summary, the paper clearly demonstrates that LSTM neural networks can accurately forecast bird movement tracks in a practical aviation scenario. By incorporating these predictions into flight planning algorithms, the probability of bird strikes can be greatly reduced through strategic avoidance.
