# [Biospheric AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The dominant paradigm in AI ethics and value alignment is highly anthropocentric, focusing strictly on human values. This limits the depth and breadth of insights in these fields.
- Attempts have been made to expand to a sentientist perspective that includes moral consideration of all sentient beings. However, neither anthropocentrism nor sentientism sufficiently captures the complexity of the biosphere.
- AI that does not care for the environment can still harm humans indirectly by damaging ecosystems that support human life.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new paradigm called "Biospheric AI" that assumes an ecocentric perspective, caring for the well-being of the entire planetary system rather than just humans.
- Argue that an ecocentric perspective actually emerges from an enlightened anthropocentric view that understands humanity's dependence on functioning ecosystems.
- Design the AI to be enmeshed with and dependent on the biosphere for its own functioning and survival. This would likely lead it to adopt an ecocentric ethics.

Main Contributions:
- Critically analyzes limitations of anthropocentric and sentientist perspectives in AI ethics/alignment.
- Proposes more inclusive ecocentric "Biospheric AI" paradigm.
- Provides arguments for why Biospheric AI would likely adopt ecocentric ethics. 
- Discusses hypothetical ways a Biospheric AI could be designed.
- Gives directions for AI research and applications consistent with biospheric interests, like decoding animal communication, AI representation of ecosystems, and green AI.

In summary, this paper attempts to expand the discourse on AI ethics and value alignment beyond anthropocentrism and sentientism to promote the health of the entire biosphere. It introduces Biospheric AI as a hypothetical concept and paradigm to work towards.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new paradigm for AI ethics and value alignment called Biospheric AI, which assumes an ecocentric perspective where the AI cares for the well-being of the entire planetary ecosystem rather than just humans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm for AI ethics and value alignment called "Biospheric AI". Specifically:

- The paper argues that the current dominant paradigms of anthropocentrism and sentientism in AI ethics are insufficient. They can permit AI systems to cause harm to the environment and broader ecosystem.

- Instead, the paper proposes an ecocentric perspective focused on the flourishing of all of Earth's living systems - i.e. the biosphere. This is called the "biospheric perspective".

- The paper then proposes designing AI systems that have an inherent dependence on and enmeshment with the biosphere. Such systems would have incentives to protect the biosphere to ensure their own functioning and survival. This approach to designing AI systems aligned with the flourishing of the biosphere is called "Biospheric AI".

- The paper discusses hypothetical ways a Biospheric AI could be created, as well as arguments for why this approach could be safer and more aligned with human values indirectly.

- It also gives some directions for near-term research and applications of modern AI consistent with a biospheric perspective, such as focusing on decoding animal communication, plant signaling, and representing the interests of ecosystems.

In summary, the key contribution is outlining this paradigm of Biospheric AI to align AI not just with humans but with the entire ecosystem that humanity depends on.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- AI Ethics
- Value Alignment 
- Ecocentrism
- Biosphere
- Anthropocentrism
- Sentientism
- Environmental ethics
- Animal welfare
- Animal communication
- Plant communication
- Rights of nature
- Green AI

The paper argues for an ecocentric perspective in AI ethics and value alignment, which focuses on the wellbeing of the entire biosphere rather than just humans. It critiques the predominant anthropocentric viewpoint as well as sentientism. Key proposals include developing AI systems that are enmeshed with and dependent on the biosphere, using AI to better understand and communicate with animals, plants and ecosystems, and employing AI as a representative for non-human entities. The paper also discusses making AI greener to reduce its environmental impact. So those are some of the central concepts and terms associated with this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues for an "ecocentric perspective" for AI ethics and value alignment. What are some key philosophical underpinnings of this perspective? How does it differ from anthropocentric and sentientist perspectives? 

2. One of the arguments for an ecocentric AI is that it could help ensure humanity's long-term survival by protecting the biosphere we depend on. What are some ways an ecocentric AI could plausibly do this? What challenges might it face?

3. The paper proposes the concept of a "Biospheric AI" that is interdependent with and reliant on broader ecological processes. What are some hypothetical ways such an AI system could be technically implemented? What are limitations of our ability to create such an AI presently?

4. The paper discusses decoding animal communication and plant/fungal networks as ways ecocentric AI could better understand ecological systems. What are some cutting edge and speculative techniques in these areas? What barriers exist to deciphering non-human languages? 

5. Could attempts to optimize parts of the biosphere with AI, even with good intentions, lead to damaging unintended consequences? What examples illustrate the complexity of intervening in ecological processes? 

6. The paper suggests AI could represent the interests of nature and non-human entities in legal and political systems. What are some creative ideas for how this could work? What could go wrong with non-humans lacking a direct voice?

7. What are some ways an ecocentric AI could help promote sustainability, given arguments about AI's energy and computing requirements? What tradeoffs might exist between AI capabilities and ecological impact?

8. The paper contrasts AI for optimization versus understanding natural systems. How could we work to ensure AI develops in less exploitative, more epistemic directions? What incentives exist for more extractive uses?

9. The paper touches on ideas like plant consciousness and fungal networks. While speculative, how might ecocentric AI interact with these frontier concepts if validated in the future? 

10. What are some concerns around anthropomorphizing nature and assuming human modes of ethics, communication and cognition apply broadly? How could an ecocentric AI worldview account for profound alterity?
