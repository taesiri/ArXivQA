# [Adversarial Retriever-Ranker for dense text retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03611)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can jointly training a retriever and ranker model in an adversarial manner improve performance on dense text retrieval tasks compared to training them independently? 2) Can an adversarial training framework help alleviate issues with false negatives that can arise during hard negative sampling when training retrieval models?3) Can incorporating a cross-encoder ranker that models fine-grained query-document interactions lead to accuracy improvements compared to just using a dual-encoder retriever?The key ideas seem to be:- Proposing an adversarial retriever-ranker (AR2) framework that contains a dual-encoder retriever and cross-encoder ranker.- Jointly training these models according to a minimax objective where the retriever tries to retrieve hard negatives to fool the ranker, and the ranker tries to distinguish true positives from the hard negatives.- This adversarial dynamic allows the retriever to receive more robust training signals from the ranker compared to just using sampled negatives.- The cross-encoder ranker can model finer query-document interactions compared to just using a dual-encoder.So in summary, the main hypotheses appear to be around whether adversarial training and incorporating a cross-encoder can improve accuracy for dense retrieval by addressing limitations around hard negative sampling and lack of fine-grained modeling. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing an adversarial retriever-ranker framework called AR2 for dense text retrieval. This consists of a dual-encoder retriever and a cross-encoder ranker that are trained jointly via a minimax game. 2. The retriever and ranker promote each other: The retriever provides harder negatives to train a better ranker, while the ranker gives progressive feedback to improve the retriever. This helps address issues like false negatives.3. Introducing a distillation regularization approach to stabilize and improve retriever training. This encourages the retriever to softly mimic the ranker.4. Achieving new state-of-the-art results on Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and MS MARCO passage ranking benchmarks through the proposed techniques. For example, AR2 improves Natural Questions R@5 to 77.9% (+2.1%), TriviaQA R@5 to 78.2% (+1.4%), and MS MARCO MRR@10 to 39.5% (+1.3%).5. Providing comprehensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of different components of AR2 over strong baselines.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the adversarial retriever-ranker framework AR2 to jointly optimize the retrieve-then-rank pipeline, along with techniques like distillation regularization. This achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple text retrieval benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes an adversarial training framework called AR2 that jointly optimizes a dual-encoder retriever and a cross-encoder ranker in a minimax game, where the retriever tries to retrieve hard negatives to fool the ranker and the ranker provides progressive direct feedback to train a better retriever.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- This paper presents an adversarial framework for jointly training a retriever and ranker model for dense text retrieval. Other recent works have also explored improving retriever-ranker pipelines, but this adversarial training approach seems quite novel.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several standard text retrieval benchmarks like Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and MS MARCO. This suggests the adversarial training approach is highly effective compared to prior methods.- The paper focuses on dense retrieval models based on dual encoders and cross encoders. This continues a recent trend in applying dense representations and neural networks to text retrieval compared to traditional sparse methods like BM25.- The adversarial training framework allows joint optimization of the retriever and ranker. Many prior works trained these components separately or in a pipeline, so joint training is an interesting direction.- The paper explores both policy gradient and imitation learning techniques to make the adversarial training end-to-end differentiable. This addresses a key challenge and represents innovative technique development.- The incorporation of distillation and pretraining also builds on recent advancements in representation learning and knowledge transfer for text retrieval models.Overall, I would say this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in dense text retrieval by proposing a novel adversarial training framework for jointly optimizing retriever-ranker models. It combines several contemporary advancements in an innovative way and achieves strong empirical results. The adversarial training idea could prove influential on future work in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different adversarial learning formulations and architectures for jointly training the retriever and ranker models. The authors propose one specific approach (AR2), but suggest there is room for exploring other adversarial objectives and model architectures.- Applying the proposed adversarial training approach to other retrieval tasks beyond text retrieval, such as image retrieval, code retrieval, etc. The authors state that extending AR2 to these other domains is a direction for future work.- Improving the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed AR2 framework. The adversarial training introduces additional computational costs, so investigating ways to optimize and scale AR2 is noted as important future work.- Extending AR2 to multi-stage retrieval systems with more than just a retriever and ranker. The authors suggest exploring how adversarial training could improve pipelines with additional stages.- Studying how to better stabilize the adversarial training process. While distillation regularization helped in AR2, the authors suggest further exploring techniques to stabilize adversarial-based retrieval training.- Applying AR2 to broader information retrieval tasks beyond just question answering/passage ranking. The authors propose evaluating AR2 more generally on benchmark IR datasets.- Investigating the use of different loss functions and sampling strategies when training AR2. The authors note this could further improve performance.In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding AR2 to other tasks/domains, improving its efficiency and scalability, stabilizing the adversarial training process, and exploring variations on the training framework like loss functions and sampling strategies. The authors position AR2 as an initial approach for joint adversarial training of retrievers and rankers that could be built on in many different ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel adversarial retriever-ranker framework called AR2 for dense text retrieval. AR2 consists of a dual-encoder retriever and a cross-encoder ranker which are trained jointly using a minimax adversarial objective. Specifically, the retriever tries to retrieve hard negative passages to fool the ranker, while the ranker tries to distinguish the ground truth passage from the hard negatives retrieved by the retriever. Through this adversarial game, the retriever receives progressive feedback from the ranker to improve retrieval of hard negatives, while the ranker benefits from ranking harder negatives provided by the stronger retriever. Experiments on Natural Questions, TriviaQA and MS-MARCO show that AR2 achieves new state-of-the-art results by significant margins. The improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial training framework in improving both the retriever and ranker modules.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an adversarial retriever-ranker framework called AR2 for dense text retrieval. AR2 consists of a dual-encoder retriever module and a cross-encoder ranker module. The two modules are trained jointly according to a minimax adversarial objective. Specifically, the retriever learns to retrieve hard negative documents to fool the ranker, while the ranker learns to distinguish between the ground truth and retrieved documents as well as provide training signals to the retriever. This adversarial framework allows the retriever and ranker to progressively improve through their interaction. The retriever receives smooth training signals from the ranker which helps alleviate issues with false negatives. Meanwhile, the ranker benefits from the harder negatives retrieved by the retriever during training. The paper also introduces a distillation regularization approach to stabilize retriever training. Experiments are conducted on Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and MS-MARCO datasets. Results show that AR2 significantly outperforms previous dense retriever baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art on all datasets. For example, AR2 improves Natural Questions R@5 to 77.9% (+2.1%), TriviaQA R@5 to 78.2% (+1.4%), and MS-MARCO MRR@10 to 39.5% (+1.3%). Further analysis demonstrates the advantages of different AR2 components like the adversarial objective, distillation regularization, and using a ranker module. The results highlight the benefits of joint adversarial training of the retriever and ranker.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an adversarial retriever-ranker framework called AR2 for dense text retrieval. AR2 consists of a dual-encoder retriever module and a cross-encoder ranker module. These two modules are trained jointly using a minimax adversarial objective, where the retriever tries to retrieve hard negative examples to fool the ranker, while the ranker tries to distinguish between the ground truth and the hard negatives retrieved by the retriever. Through this adversarial game, the retriever receives progressive feedback from the ranker to improve its ability to retrieve hard negatives, while the ranker learns from the increasingly challenging negatives provided by the retriever. A distillation regularization is also introduced to stabilize the retriever training. The parameters of the retriever and ranker are updated iteratively according to this adversarial objective.
