# [Language-Guided Music Recommendation for Video via Prompt Analogies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09327)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we recommend music for a video that matches both the visual content/style of the video as well as desired musical attributes (genre, mood, instrumentation, etc.) specified by the user in free-form natural language text?The key hypothesis is that by fusing representations of the input video and natural language text, the model can learn to retrieve music that agrees with both modalities.In more detail:- The paper proposes a model called ViML that takes as input a video and free-form text description, and retrieves a relevant music track from a database. - A key challenge is that existing datasets provide (video, music) pairs but lack textual descriptions of the music. The paper introduces a text synthesis method to generate descriptions using a music tagger and language model.- The ViML model fuses video and text representations using a Transformer architecture. A text dropout regularization method is introduced which is shown to be critical for good performance.- The paper collects a new evaluation dataset with text annotations for video clips to evaluate language-guided retrieval.- Experiments show the ViML model can match or exceed prior video-to-music models, while significantly improving retrieval when using text guidance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that fusing video and text representations allows retrieving music that agrees with both modalities, which is evaluated empirically. The key research problems are generating textual music descriptions from audio tags, and effectively fusing video and text representations for retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A new approach to automatically generate natural language descriptions of music tracks by combining outputs from a pre-trained music tagger model with a large-scale language model (BLOOM-176B). This allows synthesizing text data to train models for language-guided music recommendation when human annotations are limited.2. A Transformer-based tri-modal model architecture called ViML that fuses video and text representations to retrieve relevant music tracks. The model is designed to match both the visual content/style from the input video and the desired musical attributes (genre, mood, instrumentation) specified in the text query.3. Introduction of a text dropout regularization technique during training which is shown to significantly improve model performance by avoiding overfitting to text and forcing improved video representations.4. Release of a new dataset called YouTube8M-MusicTextClips which contains 4K high quality human annotations of free-form natural language descriptions for music clips from the YouTube8M dataset. This provides a way to evaluate language-guided music recommendation models.5. Experimental results showing the value of the text synthesis and text dropout techniques. The proposed ViML model matches or exceeds prior video-to-music retrieval methods when ignoring text input and shows substantial gains when incorporating text guidance.In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end approach for recommending music tracks matching both video content and free-form language queries describing desired music attributes. This is enabled by a new text synthesis method and carefully designed tri-modal model architecture.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method for language-guided music recommendation for video that uses an analogy-based prompting procedure with a large language model to generate natural text descriptions for music, a trimodal Transformer model with text dropout regularization for retrieval, and introduces a new annotated dataset YouTube8M-MusicTextClips for evaluating language-guided music retrieval.
