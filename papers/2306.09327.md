# [Language-Guided Music Recommendation for Video via Prompt Analogies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09327)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we recommend music for a video that matches both the visual content/style of the video as well as desired musical attributes (genre, mood, instrumentation, etc.) specified by the user in free-form natural language text?

The key hypothesis is that by fusing representations of the input video and natural language text, the model can learn to retrieve music that agrees with both modalities.

In more detail:

- The paper proposes a model called ViML that takes as input a video and free-form text description, and retrieves a relevant music track from a database. 

- A key challenge is that existing datasets provide (video, music) pairs but lack textual descriptions of the music. The paper introduces a text synthesis method to generate descriptions using a music tagger and language model.

- The ViML model fuses video and text representations using a Transformer architecture. A text dropout regularization method is introduced which is shown to be critical for good performance.

- The paper collects a new evaluation dataset with text annotations for video clips to evaluate language-guided retrieval.

- Experiments show the ViML model can match or exceed prior video-to-music models, while significantly improving retrieval when using text guidance.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that fusing video and text representations allows retrieving music that agrees with both modalities, which is evaluated empirically. The key research problems are generating textual music descriptions from audio tags, and effectively fusing video and text representations for retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new approach to automatically generate natural language descriptions of music tracks by combining outputs from a pre-trained music tagger model with a large-scale language model (BLOOM-176B). This allows synthesizing text data to train models for language-guided music recommendation when human annotations are limited.

2. A Transformer-based tri-modal model architecture called ViML that fuses video and text representations to retrieve relevant music tracks. The model is designed to match both the visual content/style from the input video and the desired musical attributes (genre, mood, instrumentation) specified in the text query.

3. Introduction of a text dropout regularization technique during training which is shown to significantly improve model performance by avoiding overfitting to text and forcing improved video representations.

4. Release of a new dataset called YouTube8M-MusicTextClips which contains 4K high quality human annotations of free-form natural language descriptions for music clips from the YouTube8M dataset. This provides a way to evaluate language-guided music recommendation models.

5. Experimental results showing the value of the text synthesis and text dropout techniques. The proposed ViML model matches or exceeds prior video-to-music retrieval methods when ignoring text input and shows substantial gains when incorporating text guidance.

In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end approach for recommending music tracks matching both video content and free-form language queries describing desired music attributes. This is enabled by a new text synthesis method and carefully designed tri-modal model architecture.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method for language-guided music recommendation for video that uses an analogy-based prompting procedure with a large language model to generate natural text descriptions for music, a trimodal Transformer model with text dropout regularization for retrieval, and introduces a new annotated dataset YouTube8M-MusicTextClips for evaluating language-guided music retrieval.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in language-guided music recommendation for video:

- This paper introduces a new approach for generating natural language music descriptions from structured tag data using large language models. Prior work on music tagging focused on constrained tag vocabularies rather than free-form text. The prompt-based synthesis method is novel for this application.

- The proposed ViML model architecture incorporates a video-text fusion module to enable joint querying of music based on visual content and text guidance. This differs from prior video-to-music works that rely only on visual input. 

- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on tag-based music retrieval compared to MVPt, a recent competitive baseline. This shows the benefit of the joint training approach.

- For language-guided retrieval, the paper shows significantly improved results by incorporating text inputs versus video alone. This highlights the value of the text guidance modality.

- The introduced text dropout technique is an important contribution for training on multimodal data like video, audio, and text. This addresses the issue of modal imbalance.

- The new YouTube8M-MusicTextClips dataset provides a valuable resource for benchmarking language-guided music retrieval. Annotating text descriptions is difficult, so the synthesis method helps enable dataset creation.

- Compared to other multimodal fusion works, this paper focuses on a novel downstream task of retrieving music to match video content and text guidance. Most prior work focused on classification or generation tasks.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in language-guided music recommendation through novel prompt-based text synthesis, a video-text fusion model, the text dropout technique, and a new dataset. The qualitative results demonstrate the flexibility enabled by text guidance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Allowing more fine-grained control over specific music attributes through the language input. The current approach takes free-form natural language as input, but they suggest exploring ways for users to more precisely specify attributes like genre, mood, tempo, etc. 

- Language-guided audio-video generation, not just retrieval. The paper focuses on retrieving suitable music tracks for a given video + text prompt. The authors suggest exploring conditional generative modeling to synthesize completely new music and/or video conditioned on textual descriptions.

- Refining the alignment between the music track and depicted action in the video. The current model retrieves music that matches the style/mood of the video but does not explicitly align musical beats to motions/actions. The authors suggest this as an interesting direction for future work.

- Incorporating other modalities beyond video, audio, and text. The paper explores joint modeling of these three modalities, but suggests exploring the incorporation of other modalities like dance motions, lyrics, etc. could be promising future work.

- Exploring different training objectives and losses. The authors use an InfoNCE contrastive loss currently. They suggest exploring other losses tailored for this multimodal retrieval setting could further improve results.

- Improving video representation and context modeling. The video encoder uses only short 30sec clips currently. Using larger context could improve results.

In summary, the key suggestions are around extending the current approach to allow finer-grained control over attributes, exploring generative modeling, incorporating additional modalities, and improving video representation/context modeling. Jointly modeling multiple modalities in generative and conditional ways seems like a very promising research direction proposed.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for recommending music that matches the style and content of an input video while allowing the user to provide free-form natural language guidance on the desired musical genre, mood, or instrumentation. The key challenges are that existing datasets lack natural language annotations paired with music and video, and naively training on multimodal data can result in models ignoring one modality. To address this, they first propose synthesizing natural language music descriptions from a pretrained tagger and large language model. Second, they design a trimodal model, ViML, to encode and fuse video and text representations to query a music embedding space. They introduce text dropout during training to prevent overfitting to text. Third, they collect a dataset with human annotations of music descriptions for a subset of the YT8M dataset and show their method improves video-to-music retrieval accuracy, especially when incorporating text guidance. The model can match or exceed prior video-only methods while better retrieving music matching text descriptions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for recommending music for a video while allowing the user to guide the music selection with free-form natural language. The key challenges are that existing datasets do not contain the needed triplets of (video, music, text), and jointly training on multiple modalities risks one modality being ignored. 

To address the lack of text descriptions, the authors propose synthesizing text using a music tagger and large language model. The tagger predicts genre, mood, and instrumentation tags which are fed to the language model to generate free-form descriptions. For training their model, dubbed ViML, they fuse CLIP video and text features through a Transformer encoder. They introduce text dropout during training to force reliance on video and prevent ignoring text. For evaluation, they collect a new dataset with human annotations of music clips. Experiments show their method improves over a state-of-the-art baseline, especially when using text guidance. The model can also match baseline performance without text through improvements from joint training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for language-guided music recommendation for video. The key challenge is that existing datasets provide (video, music) pairs but lack corresponding text descriptions of the music. To address this, the authors first propose synthesizing natural language music descriptions by combining outputs from a pre-trained music tagger model with a large language model (BLOOM-176B) using an analogy prompting approach. This results in free-form text descriptions of the music tracks. Next, the authors use these synthesized text descriptions along with existing (video, music) pairs to train a new trimodal model called ViML. ViML encodes video frames and text descriptions with separate Transformer encoders, combines the representations with a fusion module, and is trained with an InfoNCE loss to embed video+text and music in a common space for retrieval. A key component is a text dropout regularization technique during training which prevents overfitting to text and forces improved video representations. The authors demonstrate that ViML can effectively leverage both video and free-form language queries to retrieve relevant music tracks from a database.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a method for language-guided music recommendation for video. The key challenges it addresses are:

1) Existing datasets provide music+video or music+text pairs, but no datasets exist with all three modalities (music, video, text) together. This makes it difficult to train a model that can retrieve music based on both video content and text descriptions.

2) When training models on multiple modalities like video, audio, and text, it is easy for the model to overfit and ignore one modality. The paper introduces "text dropout" as a regularization technique to force the model to rely on the video, not just text.

The main contributions to address these challenges are:

1) A text synthesis method to generate natural language music descriptions from music tags and a small set of human descriptions, using a large language model.

2) A transformer-based model architecture (ViML) with a video-text fusion module to retrieve music matching both video content and text descriptions.

3) Introduction of text dropout during training to prevent overfitting to text and force improved video representations. 

4) A new dataset with 4000 text annotations for video clips to evaluate language-guided music retrieval.

In summary, the key focus is developing models for language-guided music retrieval for video when no datasets exist with all three modalities, and preventing models from ignoring the video modality when multiple inputs are present.
