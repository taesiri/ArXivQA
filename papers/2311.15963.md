# [From Pixels to Titles: Video Game Identification by Screenshots using   Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15963)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the novel task of identifying video game titles from single screenshots across 22 popular home console systems. The dataset comprises 170,881 screenshots from 8,796 games. Five CNN architectures are tested: MobileNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet variants B0, B2 and B3. Using ImageNet pre-trained weights, EfficientNetB3 achieves the best average accuracy of 74.51% across all systems, while DenseNet169 excels on 14 individual systems. Weighting the CNNs with an alternative pre-trained screenshot dataset further improves accuracy and reduces training times. Overall, the optimal combination of architecture and weights reaches 77.67% accuracy, confirming the efficacy of CNNs in extracting relevant features from screenshots for automated video game identification without relying on supplementary inputs. EfficientNetB3 leads the performance, yielding top accuracy on 19 systems. This represents a pioneering exploration into AI-based game recognition through visual snippets that could enable valuable applications in the gaming industry regarding databases, search engines, recommendations and research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of identifying video game titles from single screenshots. It tests five CNN architectures (MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, and EfficientNetB3) on a dataset of 170,881 screenshots spanning 8,796 games across 22 different home video game consoles. This is the first known attempt at using CNNs specifically for video game identification through screenshots. 

The key findings are:

- CNNs can effectively identify video game titles from single screenshots with decent accuracy (peak of 77.67% accuracy across all systems) without needing additional features. This confirms their ability to automatically extract relevant features from screenshots.

- The largest CNN architecture tested, EfficientNetB3, achieved the best overall performance. This suggests bigger networks have an advantage for this task.

- Using alternative weights pre-trained on an "Arcade" screenshots dataset instead of ImageNet improved accuracy and reduced training times for the EfficientNet models. This shows the benefits of starting from weights tuned on a more related task compared to general ImageNet weights.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the efficacy of CNNs for automated video game identification through screenshots, opening up potential future applications in areas like game recommendations and research.
