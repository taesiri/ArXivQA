# [Preventing Eviction-Caused Homelessness through ML-Informed Distribution   of Rental Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Homelessness is a pressing issue in the US, exacerbated by rising eviction rates. Rental assistance programs help prevent homelessness by providing financial aid, but have limited resources. 
- Current rental assistance allocation processes are reactive, inefficient, opaque and inequitable. Tenants must proactively apply and get put on a waitlist. Funds are not prioritized to those most at risk of homelessness.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors partner with Allegheny County, PA to improve their rental assistance program. They develop ML models to proactively identify and prioritize tenants facing eviction who are most at risk of homelessness in the next 12 months.

Key Contributions:
- Enables proactive approach that considers all tenants facing eviction, not just those who applied for help. Identifies 28% more people overlooked by current process who end up homeless.
- Implements need-based prioritization that is 20% more efficient and effective than baselines in allocating limited rental assistance resources. 10x better than random selection.
- Validated through shadow mode deployment and plans for an RCT comparing to current process. Assesses model efficacy and rental assistance effectiveness.
- Provides lessons on ethical AI system design for social impact, like the importance of scoping, avoiding data leakage, field trials, appropriate evaluation metrics and communication with policymakers.

In summary, the paper presents an ML-based decision support tool to improve rental assistance allocation, preventing more eviction-caused homelessness in an equitable manner. Key aspects are the proactive approach, validated predictive performance, and learnings for real-world AI system development.
