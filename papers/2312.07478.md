# [Double-Flow GAN model for the reconstruction of perceived faces from   brain activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07478)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Double-Flow GAN (DFGAN) for reconstructing perceived face images from fMRI brain activity patterns. The key contributions include: 1) An fMRI alignment method to map fMRI signals from different subjects to a common feature space using a linear model. 2) A Swin transformer-based generator to synthesize high-resolution face images conditioned on the aligned fMRI features. 3) A double-flow transformer discriminator that jointly processes real and fake image pairs to handle imbalance issues. 4) A two-stage training pipeline, first pretraining the model on a large face image dataset before finetuning on the smaller fMRI dataset. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing consistent and realistic face images from fMRI data. Ablation studies validate the importance of the different components. The method also shows improved generalization capability in the cross-subject setting. Overall, the DFGAN framework advances perceived face image reconstruction from human brain activity.
