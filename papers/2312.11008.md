# [Global-Local MAV Detection under Challenging Conditions based on   Appearance and Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection using either appearance features or motion features still face challenges when the background is complex, the MAV target is small, or computational resources are limited, especially for the air-to-air scenario where the camera is mounted on a flying MAV.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a global-local MAV detector (GLAD) that fuses both motion and appearance features for accurate and efficient MAV detection under challenging conditions. 

The key components of GLAD are:
1) A global detector with separate appearance-based (GAD) and motion-based (GMD) modules to search for MAVs in full-size images.
2) A local detector with appearance-based (LAD) and motion-based (LMD) modules that works on an adaptive cropped region around the target to enhance accuracy.
3) An adaptive search region based on a Kalman filter to predict target location and adjust crop region size. 
4) A detector switcher to coordinate between global and local detectors.

Main Contributions:
1) The global-to-local framework significantly improves detection accuracy and efficiency under complex backgrounds and for small MAV targets.
2) The motion-based modules help detect MAVs when appearance features are unreliable.
3) The adaptive search region makes the detector robust to occlusion and missing detections.
4) A new challenging dataset called ARD-MAV is introduced, which has complex backgrounds, 3D structures, abrupt camera motions and smaller average target size compared to prior datasets.
5) Extensive experiments show improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, and real-time detection speeds on an embedded platform.
