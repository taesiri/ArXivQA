# [High-Fidelity Face Swapping with Style Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of face swapping, which involves transferring the identity of a source face image to a target image while retaining other attributes like illumination, pose, expression etc from the target image. Previous face swapping methods using GANs struggled to balance identity similarity and retaining target image details, resulting in artifacts, distortions and training instability.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an end-to-end framework for high-fidelity face swapping. The key components are:

1) Facial Attribute Encoder: Encodes source and target images into a style code latent space capturing essential facial attributes. Uses a feature pyramid structure to explore attributes at different levels.

2) Style Blending Module (SBM): Blends source and target style codes using multi-head cross attention to transfer source face ID to target. Constraints like contrastive ID learning, landmark alignment and swap consistency guide the SBM.

3) Style Decoder: Decodes blended style code back into image space. Reuses target features to retain details. Adds noise for better separation of semantics.

Training employs adversarial learning for realism, identity similarity constraints, facial landmark alignment etc. A new dual swap consistency loss is proposed to enhance regularization.

Main Contributions:
1) End-to-end high-fidelity face swapping framework leveraging style codes
2) Style blending module with guided cross attention for accurate ID transfer
3) Multiple constraints and losses to balance ID similarity and target detail retention  
4) Dual swap consistency loss for better regularization
5) State-of-the-art visual quality of swapped faces demonstrated

The key innovation is the style code based pipeline with a style blending module and specialized constraints to achieve high quality and realistic face swaps. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
