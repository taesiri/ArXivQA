# [Contextual Action Recognition with R*CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01197)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces R*CNN, an adaptation of the R-CNN object detection framework, for the task of contextual action recognition in static images. R*CNN uses two regions - a primary region containing the person, and a secondary region that captures contextual cues related to the action. It formulates a scoring function that combines features from both regions to recognize actions. The secondary region is automatically selected to be the most informative for each action using a max operation during training. R*CNN jointly learns action-specific feature representations and classification models in an end-to-end manner using a CNN trained with SGD. It significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the PASCAL VOC Action and MPII Human Pose datasets, achieving 90.2% and 26.7% mAP respectively. The secondary regions capture relevant contextual information depending on the action and instance, like objects being interacted with, nearby people performing the action, or relevant body parts. Besides action recognition, R*CNN also achieves strong performance on the task of attribute classification by learning to focus on relevant body parts. In summary, R*CNN effectively leverages contextual cues for action recognition by automatically discovering and utilizing the most useful secondary region.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces R*CNN, an adaptation of RCNN that uses multiple regions, including contextual ones, to jointly learn features and models for improved action recognition in static images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of R*CNN, an adaptation of the R-CNN method for action recognition that jointly learns to select informative secondary regions along with action-specific feature representations. Specifically:

- R*CNN extends R-CNN to use multiple regions for classification - a primary region containing the person and a secondary region that captures contextual cues. The secondary region is automatically selected to be the most informative for each action using a max operation.

- Features and scoring models are learned jointly, allowing action-specific representations to emerge that capture things like human-object interactions. This is different from prior work that uses predefined relations or hand-engineered features.

- R*CNN achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC Actions, outperforming prior methods by 6% mean AP, and on the MPII Human Pose dataset, outperforming the previous best approach by over 20% mean AP.

- Visualizations show the secondary regions capturing relevant contextual cues like objects being interacted with, other people performing the action, or relevant scene elements. The selected cues vary in an instance-specific manner.

- R*CNN is shown to be effective not only for action recognition but also for fine-grained attribute classification.

In summary, the key innovation is the idea of jointly learning to select informative secondary regions along with action-specific models in an end-to-end framework, enabled by adaptations to the R-CNN architecture. This results in an action recognition approach that makes effective use of contextual cues.
