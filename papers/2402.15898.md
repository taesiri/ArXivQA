## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the problem of safe Bayesian optimization, where the goal is to optimize an objective function subject to safety constraints. Safety must be ensured at every iteration while seeking to maximize the objective.  

- Standard Bayesian optimization methods that greedily select points with high uncertainty do not take safety into account, and can suggest unsafe points to evaluate. This is especially problematic when safety evaluations are costly or dangerous.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Information-directed Safe Bayesian Optimization (ISBO). ISBO aims to expand the safe set over time, while reducing uncertainty about the objective function optimal value within the expanded safe region.

- ISBO uses an information-theoretic acquisition function that trades off between maximizing information gain about the objective function while ensuring safety constraints are satisfied. The safety constraints are modeled using Gaussian processes.

- A key theoretical contribution is proving that ISBO converges to the reachable safe set over time even in the presence of sampling bias, while also converging to the optimal objective value within that set.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel information-theoretic objective for safe Bayesian optimization that explicitly trades off uncertainty reduction and safety

- Theoretical analysis bounding convergence to the reachable safe set and optimal value within that set with high probability

- Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world robotics tasks demonstrating superior performance over prior Bayesian optimization methods in ensuring safety and optimization performance

In summary, the paper presents ISBO, a principled and theoretically-grounded approach to safe optimization that is especially useful when safety evaluations are costly and safety is paramount. Key benefits are provable safety and convergence guarantees along with strong empirical performance.
