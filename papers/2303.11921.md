# [Context De-confounded Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11921)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is how to mitigate the harmful context bias in context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) models. Specifically, the paper investigates how the context bias in CAER datasets leads models to learn spurious correlations between contexts and emotion labels, limiting their performance. 

The central hypothesis is that by applying causal inference tools like causal graphs and interventions, the authors can disentangle the models from the impact of the context bias and improve their ability to recognize emotions based on true causal relationships rather than spurious correlations.

In summary, the paper aims to demonstrate that causal inference provides a useful perspective and set of techniques to identify, understand, and address the context bias issue in CAER. The proposed contextual causal intervention module is designed to remove the confounding effect of the bias and help models rely more on the true causal effects between contexts, subjects, and emotions.
