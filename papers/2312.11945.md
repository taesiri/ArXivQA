# [Multi-Granularity Information Interaction Framework for Incomplete   Utterance Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11945)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Incomplete utterances with ellipsis and co-reference are common in multi-turn dialogues. This makes it difficult for dialogue systems to understand user inputs.  
- Existing approaches for Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) fail to identify the source sentences of important words needed to rewrite the utterance. As a result, they introduce irrelevant words into the rewritten utterance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a multi-task information interaction framework to capture semantic information at different granularities and fetch relevant context sentences.

- The framework has 4 main components:
   1) Context selection: Classifies context sentences as relevant or irrelevant to the incomplete utterance. 
   2) Edit matrix construction: Captures token-level relations between context and utterance to construct edit matrix.
   3) Relevance merging: Uses relevance scores from (1) to mask the edit matrix. This incorporates sentence-level relations.
   4) Intention check: Ensures semantic intention is preserved between original and rewritten utterance.

- The rewritten utterance is generated by editing the incomplete utterance based on the masked edit matrix.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to incorporate both token-level and sentence-level semantic relations for incomplete utterance rewriting.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on Restoration-200K dataset and competitive performance on CANARD dataset.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed context selection, soft relevance masking, and intention checking modules.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel multi-task interaction framework to capture multi-granularity semantic information in order to identify relevant context and important words. This allows generating improved rewritten utterances.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-task information interaction framework for incomplete utterance rewriting that captures multi-granularity semantic information to select relevant contexts, construct edit matrices, and merge relevance to rewrite incomplete utterances.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is summarized in the following quote:

"Our contributions can be summarized as:  
\textbf{1.} We are the first to incorporate sentence-level semantic relations between the utterances in contexts and the incomplete utterance to enhance the ability to seize the source sentence and figure out the important words.
\textbf{2.} We propose the multi-task information interaction framework to capture the multi-granularity of semantic information. Our approach outperforms existing methods on the benchmark dataset of this field, becoming the new state-of-the-art."

In essence, the key contribution is proposing a novel multi-task information interaction framework to capture multi-granularity semantic information for incomplete utterance rewriting. This includes incorporating sentence-level relations, identifying important words from contexts, and outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

The paper proposes a novel multi-task information interaction framework to address the task of Incomplete Utterance Rewriting. The key components include selecting relevant contexts, constructing an edit matrix to capture token-level relations, merging relevance to incorporate sentence-level relations, and checking intention consistency. The framework outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark IUR datasets. So the central focus is on multi-granularity semantic information capturing for improving performance on the IUR task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing a multi-granularity information interaction framework for incomplete utterance rewriting? Why is capturing the source of important words critical?

2. How does the context selection module work to predict the relevance between each utterance in the context and the incomplete utterance? What enhancement does it make to improve compatibility with the rewritten utterance?

3. What is the main purpose of constructing the edit matrix? How does the U-Net architecture help in encoding the word-level semantic relations?

4. Explain the working of the relevance merging process in detail. How does it utilize the predicted relevance to softly mask the edit matrix? 

5. What is the role of the intention check module? How does it help maintain intention consistency between the incomplete and rewritten utterances?

6. Walk through the overall training process. How are the losses from different modules combined for end-to-end training?

7. Once trained, how is the model used to manipulate the incomplete utterance and generate the rewritten utterance? 

8. What were the main findings from the ablation studies? Which module contributes the most to the overall performance improvement?

9. Analyze the results on the two benchmark datasets. Why does the proposed method achieve significantly better performance compared to prior state-of-the-art models?

10. What are some limitations of the current framework? How can it be improved further or be combined with recent advances like large language models?
