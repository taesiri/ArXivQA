# [Group Activity Recognition using Unreliable Tracked Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Existing group activity recognition methods rely on accurate human detection and pose tracking, which is difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios like sports videos. Methods using ground truth tracking perform well but are impractical. Bottom-up pose detection methods are more feasible but produce unreliable, error-prone tracks. This makes existing methods fail when given imperfect input tracks.

Solution - RePGARS:
The paper proposes a Rendered Pose based Group Activity Recognition System (RePGARS) which is robust to imperfect pose tracks. It renders the detected pose into images rather than using pose keypoints, with each person assigned a unique color. This means broken tracks just change the person's color, allowing the model to learn to ignore color and track them correctly. The rendered poses are fused with RGB frames as input to a 3D CNN which predicts the group activity.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of RePGARS which uses rendered pose images to achieve state-of-the-art group activity recognition performance using unreliable bottom-up pose tracks, outperforming methods needing ground truth data.
- New Australian Netball Video dataset with rich annotations of group activities for model training and evaluation.
- Experiments on volleyball and netball datasets demonstrate RePGARS outperforms latest pose-based models by over 14% and 26% respectively when given imperfect pose input tracks, with performance degrading only minimally compared to using ground truth data.

Overall, the paper makes a novel and significant contribution in achieving highly accurate video-based group activity recognition without reliance on perfect pose data, using rendered poses robust to unreliable tracks combined with RGB frames. The approach advances feasibility for real-world sports analytics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces RePGARS, a method for group activity recognition in sports videos that is robust to unreliable pose detection and tracking by fusing rendered pose representations with RGB images as input to a 3D CNN classifier.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. The authors introduce RePGARS, an innovative system for recognising group activities which operates by utilising real-time individual detection and tracking data as its primary input. Experiments indicate that RePGARS outperforms existing methods in scenarios where reliable detection and tracking information is not available.

2. Through experimental results, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of a rendered pose-based approach in capturing the intricate spatial and temporal relationships inherent in group activities in sports videos. 

3. The authors created the Australian Netball Video dataset (ANV dataset) which contains long untrimmed netball game videos with group event annotations. This is used to test the effectiveness of RePGARS in identifying group activities in sporting scenarios.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) the RePGARS method for group activity recognition using unreliable tracking, (2) demonstrating the utility of rendered pose representations, and (3) the introduction of the ANV dataset for sports video analysis.
