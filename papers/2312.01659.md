# [RiskBench: A Scenario-based Benchmark for Risk Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Risk identification is an important capability for intelligent driving systems to achieve safe mobility. It involves identifying risks stemming from dynamic traffic participants (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians) and unexpected events (e.g. collisions, construction zones). However, existing methods use independent datasets for evaluation, making direct comparison difficult. There is also a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically assess different aspects of risk identification algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes RiskBench, a large-scale scenario-based benchmark for evaluating risk identification algorithms. The key aspects are:

1) Scenario taxonomy and pipeline: A taxonomy of scenario attributes (e.g. road topology, actor behaviors) is designed to enable systematic collection of ground truth risk scenarios. Real-world scenarios are enacted in simulation by human drivers.

2) Diverse testing scenarios: The dataset contains over 6900 scenarios across 4 interaction types, 14 maps, 237 road structures, etc. This diversity aims to thoroughly evaluate risk identification.

3) Risk identification metrics: 3 metrics are used - risk localization, anticipation, and planning awareness. Planning awareness (Influenced Ratio) evaluates if identified risks can facilitate safer downstream planning.

4) Benchmarking 10 algorithms: Extensive experiments are done to benchmark different types of algorithms like rules-based, trajectory prediction, collision anticipation, behavior prediction.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduces RiskBench, a much needed standardized benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multiple facets of risk identification algorithms. 

2) Systematic scenario taxonomy and diverse scenario collection methodology.

3) Comprehensive evaluation protocol including a novel planning-aware metric. 

4) Extensive benchmarking of 10 algorithms to provide useful insights - existing algorithms lack temporal consistency of predictions and need better object representations.

5) The benchmark is publicly released to facilitate collective progress in advancing risk identification capabilities for safe autonomous driving.
