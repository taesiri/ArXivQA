# [RiskBench: A Scenario-based Benchmark for Risk Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01659)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces RiskBench, a new benchmark for evaluating risk identification algorithms for autonomous driving systems. Risk identification involves detecting risks stemming from dynamic traffic participants (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians) and unexpected events (e.g. collisions, construction zones). The authors design a taxonomy of driving scenarios to enable systematic collection of ground truth risk data across diverse situations. They construct a dataset of over 6,900 scenarios in the CARLA simulator, encompassing different interaction types, road topologies, traffic violations, densities, etc. Three evaluation metrics are proposed - risk localization, anticipation, and influence on driving decisions. Experiments compare 10 risk identification methods spanning rule-based, trajectory prediction, collision anticipation, and behavior prediction approaches. Results show limitations of current methods in consistency and representation learning. The benchmark facilitates standardized evaluation to collectively enhance safety capabilities of intelligent driving systems towards the goal of zero traffic collisions. Key future work involves ensuring temporal consistency in risk predictions and improving object-centric representations.
