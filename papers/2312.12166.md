# [Backtracking New Q-Newton's method, Schröder's theorem, and Linear   Conjugacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Newton's method is very sensitive to initial conditions and can fail to converge globally when used for finding roots of polynomials or optimizing functions. Its basins of attraction are often fractal. 
- Randomized relaxed Newton method has global convergence guarantees but chaotic, unpredictable basins of attraction.
- There is a need for root finding/optimization methods with both strong convergence guarantees and smooth, predictable basins of attraction.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a new variant of Newton's method called Backtracking New Q-Newton (BNQN) which adds perturbations to the Hessian matrix and incorporates backtracking line search. 
- BNQN has strong theoretical convergence guarantees for optimizing functions and finding roots of meromorphic functions.
- Experiments suggest BNQN has smooth, structured basins of attraction reflecting geometric configurations of roots/optima. 

Main Contributions:
- Proof that BNQN reproduces classical Schröder dynamics with smooth boundaries when finding roots of quadratics, unlike chaotic Newton.
- Result showing BNQN is invariant under linear conjugation by rotations, allowing reduction to simpler cases. 
- Detailed theoretical analysis and proofs confirming the experimental observations about smoothness and structure of BNQN basins of attraction for quadratics.
- Introduction of new variant of BNQN unifying compact and non-compact sublevel set cases.
- First rigorous confirmation that fractality of Newton basins is not intrinsic to root-finding problem but an artifact of Newton method itself.
- Opens up exploration of connections between BNQN and ODEs/geometric configurations.

In summary, the paper provides major theoretical justification for the remarkable experimental observations about predictability and smoothness of BNQN, with detailed proofs for the quadratic case. This confirms BNQN as an advancement over Newton with strong convergence and well-behaved dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proves that the Backtracking New Q-Newton method has the same basins of attraction as Newton's method for finding roots of quadratic polynomials, with the difference that BNQN has smooth rather than chaotic behavior on the boundary between the basins.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It shows that for finding roots of polynomials of degree 2, the basins of attraction of the dynamics for BNQN (Backtracking New Q-Newton's method) are the same as that for Newton's method, as given by the classical Schröder's theorem. However, the dynamics on the boundary between the basins is smooth for BNQN while chaotic for Newton's method.

2) It proves that BNQN is invariant under conjugation by linear operators of the form $A=cR$, where $R$ is unitary and $c>0$. This is similar to but more restrictive than Newton's method, which is invariant under all invertible linear transformations. This allows reducing the analysis of BNQN to simpler polynomials.

3) It introduces a new variant of BNQN, named BNQN New Variant, that includes as special cases the versions of BNQN for functions with and without compact sublevels. This unified version is used to prove the main results.

4) More broadly, the results provide rigorous theoretical justification for past experimental observations on the smoothness of basins of attraction and geometric configurations of roots using BNQN. This is a first step toward exploring connections between BNQN and topics in ODEs and geometry.

In summary, the main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of BNQN for quadratic polynomials, showing its similarities and differences with Newton's method, made possible by the conjugacy invariance property. The introduction of BNQN New Variant also helps unify theoretical studies of BNQN.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN)
- Newton's method
- Random Relaxed Newton's method
- Complex dynamics
- Basins of attraction
- Polynomial roots
- Saddle points
- Optimization
- Schröder's theorem
- Linear conjugacy invariance
- Meromorphic functions

The paper introduces and analyzes a variant of Newton's method for optimization and finding roots, called BNQN. It studies its dynamical properties like basins of attraction and compares them to classical results about Newton's method in complex dynamics, such as Schröder's theorem. Key properties such as linear conjugacy invariance are also analyzed. The relation to other methods like random relaxed Newton is discussed. The focus is on iterates in one complex variable and polynomials, but results also apply more generally to real optimizaton problems and meromorphic functions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new variant of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN New Variant) that includes previous versions of BNQN as special cases. How does this new variant improve upon previous versions of BNQN? What additional flexibility or generality does it provide?

2. Theorem 1 shows that BNQN New Variant produces the same basins of attraction as Newton's method for polynomials of degree 2, except the behavior on the boundary is smoother. What causes this similarity-difference with Newton's method? Does this indicate deeper connections between the methods?

3. Theorem 2 states that BNQN New Variant is invariant under certain linear conjugations. Newton's method has invariance under all linear conjugations. Why is BNQN New Variant not invariant under arbitrary linear conjugations? What does this tell us about differences between the methods? 

4. The proof of Theorem 1 relies in part on the appearance of the irrational number (1-√5)/2. Why does this specific number appear and what is its significance? Does it suggest any deeper mathematical structure?

5. The paper suggests basin of attraction pictures reflect geometric configurations of roots for BNQN but not necessarily Newton's method. Why might BNQN basins reflect geometry better? Is there theory to explain this?

6. For polynomials of degree 3, basin pictures differ between BNQN and backtracking line search gradient descent. Why might BNQN perform differently? Does use of the Hessian matrix explain better performance?

7. What modifications would be needed to prove similar results for higher degree polynomials? What new challenges arise going from quadratic to cubic or quartic polynomials? 

8. How readily could the analysis for 1D complex polynomials be extended to higher dimensional real optimization problems? What new issues need to be addressed?

9. The paper suggests further exploration of connections between BNQN and ODEs/geometry. What specific open questions remain about mathematical connections to other fields? 

10. What refinements could improve the BNQN New Variant algorithm? Are there other modifications or parameter choices worth investigating further experimentally or theoretically?
