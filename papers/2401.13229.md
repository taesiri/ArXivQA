# [From Random to Informed Data Selection: A Diversity-Based Approach to   Optimize Human Annotation and Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13229)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Obtaining annotated training data for supervised learning in NLP is challenging. Crowdsourcing has issues with annotator expertise and biases. Zero-shot methods have limitations compared to supervised approaches. 
- Common practice of random data selection for annotation is inefficient as it ignores data characteristics and model requirements. The problem worsens for imbalanced datasets where random sampling over-samples majority classes.

Proposed Solution:
- An automatic informed data selection architecture to identify the most informative and representative data points for annotation to build a small diverse dataset for few-shot learning. 
- Methods minimize quantity and maximize diversity of selected data to improve model performance while reducing annotation effort.

Methods:
- Reverse Semantic Search (RSS): Prioritizes dissimilar data points based on semantic similarity of embeddings.
- Ordered Clustering (OC): Clusters embeddings, then selects data systematically from each cluster by size.
- Limited Lexical Similarity (LLS): Randomly samples data points limiting n-gram overlap.

Experiments:
- Compared methods on variety of NLP datasets targeting imbalance, language, domain.
- Measure efficiency via over-annotation rate and model performance via accuracy.
- Use fine-tuning and SetFit for few-shot training.

Key Results:
- RSS and OC require less annotations than random sampling for imbalanced data.
- RSS boosts accuracy over random selection for imbalanced datasets. 
- Benefits maximize for lower shot scenarios, converging as more data is selected.
- Informed selection minimizes annotations while improving model performance.

Main Contributions:
- Automatic informed data selection architecture for few-shot NLP.
- Demonstrated methodology to minimize annotation while maximizing diversity.
- Analysis showing improved efficiency and model performance over random selection.
- Highlighted importance of accounting for imbalance in few-shot evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an automatic data selection architecture for few-shot learning that minimizes the quantity and maximizes the diversity of data selected for human annotation to build small initial datasets, while improving model performance compared to random sampling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of an automatic data selection architecture for few-shot learning that leverages active learning principles to identify the most informative and representative data points for annotation.

2. An extensive analysis of various implementations of this architecture, highlighting its effectiveness to build the first version of a dataset in the context of low-resource text classification.

In other words, the paper proposes and evaluates methods for selectively choosing which data points should be manually annotated when constructing a dataset from scratch with limited resources. This informed data selection approach aims to minimize the quantity of annotations needed, while maximizing the diversity and informativeness of the annotated data. The results show that this leads to improved model performance compared to random sampling, especially in cases with severe class imbalance.

The paper introduces an informed data selection architecture for few-shot learning in low-resource NLP scenarios. It aims to identify the most informative and representative datapoints to annotate in order to build a small diverse dataset and improve model performance. The methods leverage active learning principles to minimize annotation redundancy and maximize diversity. Experiments compare the overannotation rate and model accuracy to a random sampling baseline across datasets with varying degrees of imbalance. The reverse semantic search (RSS) method performs the best overall in terms of efficiency and accuracy, especially for imbalanced data.
