# [Supervised Knowledge Makes Large Language Models Better In-context   Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15918)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the establishment of a simple yet effective framework called "SuperContext" that enhances the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) It allows LLMs to better generalize to out-of-distribution data by incorporating predictions and confidence scores from task-specific fine-tuned models into the prompts during inference. 

2) It elucidates how LLMs can benefit from discriminative models through this prompting approach.

3) It minimizes hallucinations in generative tasks like question answering by providing supervision from fine-tuned models.

Through empirical evaluations on natural language understanding and question answering tasks, the authors show that enhanced versions of models like Llama and ChatGPT using SuperContext outperform the original models in terms of generalizability and factuality. The method contributes to making LLMs more reliable for real-world deployment.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes SuperContext, a method to incorporate predictions from a supervised task-specific language model into the prompt for a large language model. How does providing the prediction and confidence score from the supervised model help improve the performance of the large language model? What are the key mechanisms underlying this improvement?

2. The paper evaluates SuperContext on out-of-distribution natural language understanding tasks. Why is out-of-distribution evaluation important for assessing the effectiveness of this method? What unique challenges does out-of-distribution evaluation present?  

3. The paper shows SuperContext reduces the hallucination rate in question answering tasks with unanswerable questions. What properties of the method contribute to more factual and reliable responses from the large language model?

4. The analysis shows the large language model sometimes overrides incorrect predictions from the supervised model. What factors determine when the large language model should trust versus override the supervised model's predictions?

5. The calibration analysis shows a correlation between the supervised model's confidence and the large language model's accuracy. Why does model confidence play an important role in SuperContext? How could confidence scores be further utilized?  

6. The interpretation analysis tries to explain how the large language model learns from and utilizes the in-context examples. What were the key findings and limitations? How could the interpretation be improved?

7. The paper focuses on natural language understanding and question answering tasks. What other downstream tasks could benefit from supervised guidance through SuperContext during inference?

8. What other types of supervised knowledge beyond label predictions could be provided in the prompt to improve in-context learning? Are there potential downsides to providing too much guidance? 

9. How does SuperContext compare to other methods like contrastive decoding that also leverage auxiliary models? What are the tradeoffs between different approaches?

10. The paper studies SuperContext on several recent large language models. How could we expect performance to change using other models? What model architectures and designs could better utilize in-context supervised guidance?
