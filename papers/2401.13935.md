# [A New Paradigm for Counterfactual Reasoning in Fairness and Recourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13935)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional counterfactual fairness criteria rely on hypothetically intervening on legally-protected characteristics like race or gender. However, such interventions may not accurately reflect complex social constructs.
- There is a need for counterfactual fairness criteria that do not require problematic demographic interventions, while still reasoning about fairness and discrimination.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new paradigm using "backtracking counterfactuals" which explain counterfactual outcomes by imagining changes to initial conditions rather than through interventions.
- Formalize concepts of "opportunity" and "effort" to define fairness - e.g. a group's opportunities to achieve certain outcomes. 
- Propose various novel counterfactual criteria based on equality of opportunity or effort, both for individuals and groups.

Key Contributions:
- First counterfactual fairness notions that avoid problematic demographic interventions, allowing reasoning about fairness without modularity assumptions.
- New computational definitions of opportunity and effort using backtracking counterfactuals.
- Individual and group-level criteria for equality of opportunity and effort. 
- Demonstrated new criteria on synthetic hiring data and a law school admissions dataset, showing they capture different fairness properties than previous criteria.

In summary, this paper pioneers an innovative approach to counterfactual fairness that moves away from demographic interventions. It lays the groundwork for an alternative research direction based on formalizing concepts like opportunity and effort to quantify discrimination.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new paradigm for counterfactual reasoning in algorithmic fairness that moves beyond demographic interventions to instead ask what would explain counterfactual outcomes, and uses this to define new criteria quantifying opportunity and effort.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm for counterfactual reasoning in algorithmic fairness and recourse that does not rely on hypothetical interventions on legally-protected characteristics. Specifically, the paper:

- Introduces new technical notions of counterfactual opportunity and effort to quantify unfairness for individuals or groups. This includes formal definitions of concepts like an individual's counterfactual opportunity to achieve an outcome.

- Defines several new counterfactual discrimination criteria based on equality of opportunity and effort, both at the individual and group levels. These allow considering fairness while avoiding demographic interventions.

- Develops a simple algorithm for sampling backtracking counterfactuals to estimate the proposed criteria.

- Demonstrates the proposed concepts and criteria on both synthetic hiring datasets and a real law school dataset, highlighting how they capture something philosophically different from existing interventional criteria.

In summary, the paper lays the foundation for a new research agenda in algorithmic fairness using backtracking rather than interventional counterfactuals, enabling new ways to reason about fairness and discrimination without relying on problematic assumptions about complex demographic variables.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Backtracking counterfactuals - The paper introduces a new paradigm for counterfactual reasoning based on backtracking counterfactuals rather than the traditional interventional counterfactuals. Backtracking counterfactuals imagine changes to initial conditions rather than interventions.

- Opportunity - The paper defines new notions of counterfactual opportunity at both the individual and group level to quantify unfairness. These capture the opportunities individuals have to achieve certain outcomes.

- Effort - The paper also defines counterfactual effort quantities to capture the effort required for individuals or groups to achieve certain outcomes. These can be used to define equality of effort criteria. 

- Equality of opportunity - New criteria are proposed such as individual and group equality of counterfactual opportunity. These equate the counterfactual opportunities of individuals or groups.

- Equality of effort - Similarly, criteria like group equality of effort are proposed to equate the counterfactual effort across groups. 

- Non-interventional - The new criteria depart from the need to consider interventions on legally protected characteristics.

- Legally-protected characteristics - The framework allows reasoning about fairness while still incorporating legally-protected attributes like race, gender etc.

- Individual and group fairness - The criteria introduced capture fairness at both the individual and group level.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with using backtracking counterfactuals to define new non-interventional, opportunity and effort-based criteria for algorithmic fairness and discrimination.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new paradigm for counterfactual reasoning that does not rely on interventions on protected attributes. Can you explain the limitations of the traditional interventional counterfactual approach that motivated exploring an alternate paradigm?

2. The concept of "backtracking counterfactuals" is central to the proposed approach. Can you clearly define what a backtracking counterfactual is and how it differs from traditional interventional counterfactuals, both conceptually and computationally? 

3. The paper argues that backtracking counterfactuals are a more natural semantic fit for explaining counterfactual outcomes. Can you expand on this argument and discuss whether you agree or disagree? What are the relative pros and cons?

4. The non-informative backtracking conditional distribution is proposed to capture agency and opportunity. What assumptions does this distribution encode about agency and how appropriate are they for real-world settings? Can you propose improvements?  

5. The paper defines new notions of "counterfactual opportunity" and "counterfactual effort." How precisely do these technical definitions quantify the intuitive concepts they aim to capture? What limitations might the formalizations have?

6. Can you critically analyze the algorithm for sampling from the joint distribution of factual and counterfactual variables? What implicit assumptions does it make and what are its computational limitations?

7. The synthetic hiring simulation experiments aim to showcase the criteria on balanced versus imbalanced scenarios. What specifically do the results show and what inferences can we draw about the opportunity and effort criteria?

8. The law school experiment compares models on the proposed criteria versus traditional interventional counterfactual fairness. What do the results concretely show? Do you have an alternative explanation?

9. The paper claims the introduced criteria enable departing from interventions on protected attributes while retaining benefits of counterfactual reasoning. Do you agree this is achieved? What open questions remain?

10. How might the ideas in this paper extend to even more complex graphical models with unmeasured confounding between protected attributes and outcomes? What new difficulties arise?
