# [Holo-VQVAE: VQ-VAE for phase-only holograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Holography is an emerging visual technology that offers immersive 3D visualizations by capturing both amplitude and phase of light waves. However, generative models have not been well explored for hologram generation, limiting innovation in this field.  

- Existing hologram generation methods rely on converting images to holograms. This limits the diversity of holograms that can be generated. Directly learning and generating phase-only holograms (POHs) is challenging due to the complexity of phase data.

- Previous attempts at using generative models like VAEs for hologram generation have faced difficulties in learning from and generating high-fidelity, novel holograms.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Holo-VQVAE, a novel generative model architecture tailored for POH generation. 

- It uses images as input and calculates reconstruction loss in the image domain after propagating the generated POH using Angular Spectrum Method. This allows more effective training than directly using phase data.

- It employs VQ-VAE with discrete latent space instead of standard VAE to better capture complex POH distributions and prevent entanglement of learned features.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end generative model architecture focused specifically on generating novel POHs 

- Integrates Angular Spectrum Method into training for image domain supervision

- Uses VQ-VAE with discrete latent space to improve learning and generation quality compared to standard VAE

- Demonstrates reconstructed and randomly sampled high quality POHs on datasets like CelebA-HQ

- Pioneering work towards integrating advanced generative models into hologram generation for enabling new applications and exploration of holographic content creation
