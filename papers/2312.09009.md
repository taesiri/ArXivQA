# [Adaptive parameter sharing for multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09009)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel parameter sharing technique called Adaptive Parameter Sharing (AdaPS) for large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning. AdaPS first uses variational autoencoders to encode each agent's identity and clusters agents based on the identity vectors. It then feeds the cluster centers into a mapping network to generate masks for constructing diverse subnetworks for agents in each cluster. By sharing experiences within a cluster while differentiating strategies across clusters, AdaPS achieves higher sample efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters. Experiments across multiple multi-agent environments demonstrate that AdaPS generates policies with sufficient diversity and close to or even better performance compared to methods without parameter sharing or with full parameter sharing. Overall, AdaPS provides an effective way to balance scalability and strategy differentiation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces scalability issues when dealing with a large number of agents, due to growth in the number of parameters. 
- Naive parameter sharing methods assume all agents have similar characteristics, limiting their effectiveness when agents have heterogeneous capabilities or rewards.
- Methods like selective parameter sharing still see parameter growth with increasing agent types.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adaptive Parameter Sharing (AdaPS) to address both scalability and agent heterogeneity. 
- AdaPS uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode agent identities into vectors. These are clustered to group similar agents.
- A mapping network takes cluster centers and generates masks to construct subnetworks for each cluster. This allows experience sharing within clusters.
- The method does not introduce any additional parameters during RL training, ensuring scalability.

Main Contributions:
- AdaPS enables experience sharing for similar agents through subnetworks to improve sample efficiency.
- The method generates sufficiently differentiated strategies for heterogeneous agents via distinct subnetworks.  
- AdaPS addresses scalability without parameter growth as number of agents increases.
- Experiments across multiple MARL environments demonstrate close to or better performance than baselines while requiring significantly fewer parameters.

In summary, AdaPS introduces an adaptive parameter sharing approach using identity encoding and network masking to effectively handle agent heterogeneity and scalability issues in MARL. The method achieves strong performance with low parameters.
