# [Adaptive parameter sharing for multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09009)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel parameter sharing technique called Adaptive Parameter Sharing (AdaPS) for large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning. AdaPS first uses variational autoencoders to encode each agent's identity and clusters agents based on the identity vectors. It then feeds the cluster centers into a mapping network to generate masks for constructing diverse subnetworks for agents in each cluster. By sharing experiences within a cluster while differentiating strategies across clusters, AdaPS achieves higher sample efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters. Experiments across multiple multi-agent environments demonstrate that AdaPS generates policies with sufficient diversity and close to or even better performance compared to methods without parameter sharing or with full parameter sharing. Overall, AdaPS provides an effective way to balance scalability and strategy differentiation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems.
