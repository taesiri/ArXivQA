# [LLMs-based Few-Shot Disease Predictions using EHR: A Novel Approach   Combining Predictive Agent Reasoning and Critical Agent Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15464)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable patient data for tasks like disease prediction, but traditional supervised learning approaches require large labeled datasets which are expensive and difficult to obtain. 
- There is untapped potential in applying large language models (LLMs) that can perform well with minimal data due to their ability to leverage vast knowledge and adapt quickly.  
- It remains unexplored whether LLMs can be effectively applied to EHR-based disease prediction tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Convert structured EHR visit data into natural language narratives to enable LLM understanding.
- Evaluate zero-shot and few-shot performance of LLM models on disease prediction using various prompting strategies (e.g. chain-of-thought reasoning, factor interactions, prevalence information).  
- Propose a novel approach called EHR-CoAgent that uses two LLM agents - a predictor agent that makes predictions and a critic agent that analyzes incorrect predictions and provides feedback.
- The critic agent's feedback is used to refine the prompts for the predictor agent. This enables continuous improvement of predictive performance.

Key Contributions:
- First study investigating efficacy of LLMs for EHR-based disease prediction and influence of prompting strategies.
- Novel approach leveraging collaborative LLM agents - predictor agent for reasoning and critic agent for instructional feedback.
- Significantly improved predictive performance demonstrating feasibility of using LLMs for disease prediction with minimal supervision. 
- Practical insights and guidance on prompting strategies for employing LLMs in diagnostic tasks with limited labeled data.

In summary, the paper explores using LLMs for low resource EHR-based prediction, proposes a collaborative agent framework to enhance performance, and provides insights to guide future work in this direction.
