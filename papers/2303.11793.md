# [OTJR: Optimal Transport Meets Optimal Jacobian Regularization for   Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is examining and comparing two major approaches for improving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks: adversarial training (AT) and Jacobian regularization (JR). 

The authors aim to provide both a theoretical and empirical analysis to characterize the differences between AT and JR and how they impact the design of robust deep learning models. Their goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how to augment adversarial robustness. 

Specifically, some of the central questions and goals addressed in this work include:

- How do AT and JR differ theoretically in terms of how they tackle adversarial perturbations? The authors derive the theoretical foundations of both methods.

- What are the distinct empirical effects of AT vs. JR on the layers and activations of a defensive DNN? The authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the different impacts. 

- Can AT and JR be effectively combined in a principled manner to improve adversarial robustness? The authors propose a novel framework, OTJR, that integrates both techniques through optimal transport theory.

- Does the proposed OTJR method outperform state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses? The authors evaluate OTJR extensively on benchmark datasets and attacks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that judiciously combining insights from AT and JR can lead to enhanced adversarial robustness compared to either technique alone. The paper aims to deliver both theoretical and empirical support for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The paper provides both a theoretical and empirical analysis comparing adversarial training (AT) and Jacobian regularization (JR), two main approaches for improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. It characterizes the differences between AT and JR, with AT focusing on aligning the representations of clean and adversarial samples at the output, while JR aims to silence the input-output Jacobian matrix.

2. The paper proposes a new defense method called OTJR that integrates both AT and JR in an innovative way using optimal transport theory. Specifically, it uses the Sliced Wasserstein distance to efficiently push adversarial representations closer to clean ones during AT. It also derives optimal movement directions from the Sliced Wasserstein computation to better inform the input-output Jacobian regularization. 

3. Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates OTJR's superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art defense methods on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Under white-box and black-box attacks, OTJR achieves significantly higher accuracy than prior defenses. The method also shows strong performance on real-world images under an online attack setting.

In summary, the main contributions are:

- A joint theoretical and empirical characterization of AT vs JR defenses

- A novel OTJR defense integrating AT and optimal JR using Sliced Wasserstein distances  

- Demonstrating OTJR's state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and attack settings

The dual theoretical and empirical analysis of AT and JR, combined with the innovative optimal transport approach to fuse them in OTJR, are the key innovations presented in the paper.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Optimal Transport with Jacobian Regularization (OTJR) that enhances adversarial robustness in deep neural networks by jointly incorporating input-output Jacobian regularization into adversarial training using the Sliced Wasserstein distance, achieving state-of-the-art defense performance against a range of white-box and black-box attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to prior work on defending against adversarial attacks in deep neural networks:

- It provides both a theoretical and empirical analysis comparing two major defense paradigms - adversarial training (AT) and Jacobian regularization. Most prior work has focused on either theory or experiments, but not a comprehensive characterization of both approaches. This paper bridges that gap and offers new insights into their differential impacts on model robustness.

- It proposes a novel defense method, OTJR, that integrates Jacobian regularization into adversarial training in an innovative way using optimal transport theory. This is a unique approach not explored before that aims to get the best of both worlds. 

- OTJR leverages the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance for adversarial training. Using SW for AT is novel and provides faster convergence compared to prior work like SAT. The optimal transport plan also provides informative directions to further optimize the Jacobian regularization.

- The evaluations are extensive, covering diverse datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet, Intel), network architectures (WRN, ResNet), and attacks (PGD, CW, AutoAttack etc). OTJR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses like TRADES and SAT, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- The paper provides useful ablation studies to analyze model behaviors and the impact of different components. This sheds light on the inner workings of adversarial robustness.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in adversarial defense through its insightful analysis unifying two major approaches, novel integration of techniques, and comprehensive evaluations. It sets a new standard for principled and empirically grounded defense methodology development.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more efficient and scalable algorithms for solving the optimal transport problem, especially for high-dimensional data. The authors mention that their current approach has limitations in scaling to very large datasets. New algorithms and approximations could help extend optimal transport techniques to even bigger and more complex datasets.

- Exploring the use of optimal transport for additional applications in machine learning and computer vision beyond adversarial robustness. The authors demonstrate the utility of optimal transport for aligning distributions in the context of adversarial training, but suggest it could have broader uses like domain adaptation, generative modeling, etc.

- Combining optimal transport objectives with other regularization techniques for improving adversarial robustness and generalization. The authors show promising results by integrating optimal transport with Jacobian regularization, but suggest combining it with other defenses like model distillation could also be beneficial.

- Theoretically analyzing the connections between optimal transport distances and adversarial vulnerability. The authors provide empirical evidence that optimizing transport cost leads to more robust models, but further theoretical analysis could strengthen this relationship.

- Evaluating optimal transport methods on larger-scale and more complex datasets. The authors mainly experiment on CIFAR-10/100, so testing on ImageNet, video, medical images, etc. could better reveal benefits and limitations.

- Exploring alternatives to the Sliced Wasserstein approximation used in this work. Other optimal transport distances or approximations may provide advantages, especially in very high dimensions.

In summary, the authors lay a solid groundwork using optimal transport for adversarial defense, but suggest many opportunities remain for improving computational efficiency, expanding applications, combining with other techniques, theoretical analysis, and evaluation across diverse problem domains. Advancing research in these directions could further unleash the potential of optimal transport in machine learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework called OTJR that integrates adversarial training (AT) and input-output Jacobian regularization to improve the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. The key idea is to leverage the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance to efficiently minimize the distribution gap between clean and adversarial samples in AT. The SW distance provides optimal movement directions for adversarial samples, which are then used to optimize Jacobian regularization instead of random projections. This allows regulating the most sensitive directions to perturbations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and Imagenet datasets demonstrate that OTJR achieves superior defense performance compared to state-of-the-art AT methods like TRADES, ALP, and SAT. For example, OTJR attains over 51% and 28% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under AutoAttack. The benefits are further validated on real-world images. Overall, the novel integration of SW distance and optimized Jacobian regularization in OTJR sets a new standard for adversarial robustness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper analyzes and compares the impacts of adversarial training (AT) and Jacobian regularization (JR) on improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. The authors first provide theoretical analysis showing that AT aims to align the representations of clean and adversarial samples at the output layer, while JR suppresses the input-output Jacobian matrix to stabilize the model's predictions. Empirically, the authors demonstrate that both AT and JR can suppress activation magnitudes, contradicting claims that lower activation alone leads to robustness. AT adjusts model parameters to handle perturbations, while JR silences gradients. 

Based on these characterizations, the authors propose a novel method called Optimal Transport with Jacobian Regularization (OTJR). OTJR utilizes Sliced Wasserstein distance for faster adversarial training convergence. Critically, this provides optimal movement directions to enhance JR, regularizing the Jacobian matrix along the most sensitive directions. Experiments across datasets and network architectures demonstrate OTJR's superior performance, with over 1-2% average accuracy gains. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the proposed innovations. Overall, this work provides novel theoretical analysis and an effective fusion of AT and JR for adversarial defense.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel defense method called Optimal Transport with Jacobian Regularization (OTJR) to improve the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. The key idea is to leverage optimal transport theory to align the distributions of clean and adversarial samples in the latent space, while also regularizing the input-output Jacobian matrix. Specifically, OTJR uses the Sliced Wasserstein distance to efficiently minimize the gap between clean and adversarial representations. This provides optimal movement directions for adversarial samples, which are then incorporated into a Jacobian regularization term. By substituting the standard random projections with these informative optimal directions, OTJR conducts Jacobian regularization along the most sensitive directions. The overall training loss combines adversarial cross-entropy loss, Sliced Wasserstein distance to match distributions, and optimal Jacobian regularization. Experiments demonstrate OTJR's superiority over state-of-the-art defense methods like adversarial training and distribution alignment, particularly on high-dimensional image datasets. The proposed framework effectively integrates the strengths of optimal transport, Jacobian regularization, and adversarial training for enhanced model robustness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of adversarial attacks on deep neural networks, and how to defend against them. Specifically, it is comparing and analyzing two main approaches for improving adversarial robustness: 

1) Adversarial Training (AT): This involves generating adversarial examples by adding small perturbations to clean images, and including these in the training data to teach the model to be robust. 

2) Jacobian Regularization (JR): This involves regularizing the Jacobian matrix, which represents the sensitivity of the model's outputs to changes in the inputs. By suppressing the Jacobian, the model becomes more stable/robust to small input perturbations.

The key contributions of the paper are:

- It provides both a theoretical analysis and empirical characterization of how AT and JR impact model robustness differently. Prior work has not directly compared these two major defense paradigms.

- It proposes a new defense method called OTJR that combines both AT and JR in an innovative way, using optimal transport theory and sliced Wasserstein distance to derive optimal perturbation directions to inform the JR. 

- It demonstrates through extensive experiments that OTJR outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets against various white-box and black-box attacks.

So in summary, this paper makes progress on understanding, comparing, and improving adversarial defenses by jointly optimizing AT and JR in a principled and effective manner. The key insight is that combining these two complementary techniques can yield better robustness than either one alone.
