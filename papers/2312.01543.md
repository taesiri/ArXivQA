# [Torso-Based Control Interface for Standing Mobility-Assistive Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01543)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a torso-based control interface with compliant support for standing mobility assistive devices. The interface includes a compliant support mechanism and sensing system to enable intuitive hands-free control of the device's movement. The mechanism is designed to support the user's upper body weight and body movement for device control. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the control performance and usability compared to joystick control. Results showed comparable performance to joystick control for navigation tasks in metrics like completion time and trajectory accuracy, with advantages for object manipulation tasks. Users rated the torso interface as intuitive and useful, though less comfortable and demanding more effort than joystick initially. Overall, the torso interface enables hands-free control for improved manipulation abilities, with the potential to become natural with practice. The work demonstrates an effective hands-free solution to expand abilities of mobility device users.
