# [Detecting Events in Crowds Through Changes in Geometrical Dimensions of   Pedestrians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06495)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates detecting unusual events in crowded videos based on changes observed in individual pedestrian behaviors instead of a globally trained model. They propose using the software GeoMind to extract features like emotions, personality, and cultural aspects on a person-level across the video timeline. They apply this to three distinct test videos showing (1) normal crowd behavior in a mall, (2) sudden crowd dispersion, and (3) a person attacked by aggressors. Through analyzing changes in metrics like speed, interpersonal distance, and emotional state of key subjects in each video, they show noticeable variations correlating with the visually evident events. They highlight that events like sudden dispersions are more easily detectable in these metrics than nuanced interactions like fights. Overall, the results validate that their approach of detecting events through changes in pedestrians individually as opposed to crowds in aggregate can identify unusual crowd events without needing an explicit training phase. The summaries could further aid validating agent simulations to react realistically.
