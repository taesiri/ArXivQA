# [Learning fast changing slow in spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges when applied to real-world problems due to limited interactions with the environment and scarcity of available data. This limitation is more difficult in recurrent spiking networks where noise from spikes further complicates learning.  
- There is an inherent tension between plasticity (acquiring new knowledge) and stability that lifelong learning machines need to resolve, known as the plasticity-stability paradox.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a biologically plausible approximation of proximal policy optimization (PPO) to address the challenges of limited data and noise in recurrent spiking networks.
- The approach involves using two parallel networks working on different timescales: 
   - A reference policy network interacts with the environment to acquire new data while maintaining a stable policy.  
   - A future policy network quickly updates parameters to evaluate future policies based on the new data.
- This allows seamlessly assimilating new information without changing the current policy and enables experience replay without policy divergence. 

Main Contributions:
- Enables more efficient learning with limited online data by combining the stability benefits of the reference network with fast adaptation of the future policy network.
- Addresses plasticity-stability paradox in lifelong learning by keeping current policy stable while evaluating future policy changes.  
- Allows effective experience replay without risks of policy divergence or instability from overuse of experiences.
- Computationally efficient for online learning compared to other experience replay techniques.
- Showcases effectiveness on a reinforcement learning testbed (Atari game simulation) indicating applicability for real-world neuromorphic systems.

In summary, the paper proposes an approach to improve reinforcement learning in spiking neural networks by using separate networks at different timescales. This enhances learning efficiency, enables stable experience replay, and balances plasticity and stability needs for lifelong learning scenarios.
