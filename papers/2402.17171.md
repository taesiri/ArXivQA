# [LiveHPS: LiDAR-based Scene-level Human Pose and Shape Estimation in Free   Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing optical and inertial motion capture methods have limitations in uncontrolled environments due to sensitivity to lighting conditions or requiring body-mounted sensors. 
- LiDAR sensors can enable robust 3D human pose and shape estimation (HPS) by providing precise depth information. However, LiDAR point clouds have challenging properties - varying distributions across distances/devices, incomplete due to occlusion, and noisy in complex scenarios.  
- Previous LiDAR-based HPS methods lack capabilities to fully estimate body shape or global translation, and are not robust enough for real-world deployment.

Proposed Solution - LiveHPS:
- A novel single-LiDAR-based approach to estimate full SMPL parameters (pose, shape, global translation) in large-scale free environments without constraints.
- An Adaptive Vertex-guided Distillation (VAD) module to align diverse point distributions with regular SMPL vertex distribution in feature space for robustness.
- A Consecutive Pose Optimizer (CPO) that utilizes temporal-spatial geometric and dynamic information to refine poses and reduce occlusion/noise impact. 
- A Skeleton-aware Translation Solver to intelligently integrate point clouds and skeletal data to eliminate occlusion/noise effects on translation prediction.

Main Contributions:
- A novel robust single-LiDAR method to estimate complete human SMPL parameters in uncontrolled large-scale scenes.
- Effective VAD, CPO and translation solver modules to address key challenges of LiDAR point clouds.
- Introduction of FreeMotion, a large multi-view multi-modal human motion dataset with full SMPL annotations captured in diverse real-life scenarios.
- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. LiveHPS generalizes reliably across datasets and in very challenging cases.

In summary, this paper presents a novel LiDAR-based solution, LiveHPS, to enable robust and high-quality 3D human pose and shape capture without environmental constraints, along with a large real-world dataset to facilitate further research.
