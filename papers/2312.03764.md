# [Similarity-based Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Domain Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Similarity-based Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning":

Problem:
- Transferring knowledge across reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with different state and action spaces (cross-domain) is challenging as it requires finding an equivalence between them. 
- Most methods assume source and target tasks share some high-level structure or require expert supervision to select source tasks. This limits applicability.
- Goal is to transfer knowledge across tasks without assumptions of shared structure or expert supervision.

Proposed Solution:
- Learn to align state-action spaces of tasks using a "Reward-Based Alignment" (ReBA) loss. Matches states/actions with similar rewards.
- Define a similarity function to compare dynamics of aligned source and target tasks. Ranks source tasks. 
- Transfer actions from best source task's policy to target via learned alignment. Reduces target task's training.

Contributions:
- ReBA loss for unsupervised cross-domain alignment without paired/aligned data.
- Similarity function to select best source task from varied set, based on reward/transition dynamics. 
- Knowledge transfer algorithm ("SimKnoT") that transfers actions from most similar source to target task.
- Experiments on Mujoco tasks show method can correctly identify similar tasks and achieve better performance than RL baselines.
- First similarity-based method for cross-domain knowledge transfer without assuming source/target share structure. Automates source selection.

In summary, the paper presents an unsupervised approach to transfer knowledge across RL tasks with different state-action spaces. By learning to align spaces and compare dynamics, it can identify the most similar source task and transfer its actions to improve learning in the target task. Key benefit is not needing to assume or know a priori that tasks are related.
