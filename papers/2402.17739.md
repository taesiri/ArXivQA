# [reBandit: Random Effects based Online RL algorithm for Reducing Cannabis   Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cannabis use and associated disorders are increasing globally, posing a public health challenge. There is a large treatment gap, especially among emerging adults (ages 18-25). 
- Mobile health technologies like apps and sensors could help provide personalized support to reduce cannabis use, but more evidence is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called \algorithmname{} that will be used in an upcoming mobile health study called \trialname. 
- \trialname will deliver personalized mobile interventions to reduce cannabis use in 120 emerging adults over a 30-day pilot. 
- \algorithmname{} decides whether and when to deliver intervention messages to each user to maximize engagement while accounting for heterogeneity in the population.

Key Contributions:
- \algorithmname{} utilizes random effects and informative Bayesian priors to enable efficient personalized learning from limited noisy mobile health data. 
- It employs empirical Bayes to update hyper-parameters online in a stable and autonomous way throughout the study.
- Smooth posterior sampling and engineered rewards account for delayed effects of interventions. 
- Comprehensive simulation experiments show \algorithmname{} performs equal or better than common approaches as population heterogeneity increases.
- Implementation details like storing algorithmic decisions facilitate reproducibility and scrutiny of the approach after the study.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel RL algorithm to deliver personalized mobile health interventions for reducing cannabis use, demonstrates its effectiveness via simulations, and describes design choices to enable adoption in real-world clinical studies.
