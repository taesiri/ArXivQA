# [Feature Denoising Diffusion Model for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11949)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing deep learning based blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods typically rely on features transferred from high-level vision tasks like image classification. However, the differences between these high-level tasks and BIQA introduce noise into the quality-aware features. This causes the models to focus excessively on semantic information while overlooking quality-relevant distortions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel BIQA framework called Perceptual Feature Diffusion for IQA (PFD-IQA) that formulates the feature noise filtering as a progressive feature denoising process using diffusion models. The key ideas are:

1) Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation (PDA) Module: Discovers potential distortion-aware and quality-level features using auxiliary tasks. Text prompts describing quality perceptions are aggregated based on similarity to guide diffusion model's denoising.

2) Perceptual Prior-based Feature Refinement Strategy: Establishes quality-aware denoising trajectories using teacher pseudo features. Matches student features to trajectory using adaptive noise alignment. Performs cross-attention guided diffusion model based denoising to precisely refine features.


Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce diffusion models for feature denoising in BIQA task.

- Proposes PDA module to identify and aggregate perceptual text prompts to control quality-aware feature preservation during denoising.  

- Introduces adaptive student-teacher feature alignment strategy and cross-attention guided diffusion denoising to refine features even without explicit quality benchmarks.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 BIQA datasets with lightweight model and sampling, demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, the paper pioneers the use of diffusion models for BIQA by designing specialized modules that leverage perceptual priors and text conditioning to effectively filter quality-irrelevant noise from features in the absence of reference images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel blind image quality assessment framework called Perceptual Feature Diffusion for IQA (PFD-IQA) that leverages diffusion models to progressively refine quality-aware features under the guidance of aggregated perceptual text prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It makes the first attempt to convert the challenges of BIQA (Blind Image Quality Assessment) to the diffusion problem for feature denoising. It introduces a novel framework called PFD-IQA (Perceptual Feature Diffusion model for Image Quality Assessment) which effectively filters out quality-irrelevant information from features.

2) It proposes a Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation Module to identify perceptual features related to distortion types and quality levels. By leveraging the correlation between perceptual priors and text embeddings, it adaptively aggregates perceptual text prompts to guide the diffusion denoising process and ensure attention to quality-aware features. 

3) It introduces a novel Perceptual Prior-based Feature Refinement Strategy for BIQA. It pre-defines denoising trajectories of teacher pseudo-labels, and uses an adaptive noise alignment module to match student noise features to these trajectories. It then performs precise feature denoising based on the given prompt conditions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the PFD-IQA framework and its two key modules (Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation, and Perceptual Prior-based Feature Refinement) to effectively denoise and refine quality-aware features for blind image quality assessment.
