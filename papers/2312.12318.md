# [An Alternate View on Optimal Filtering in an RKHS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) methods like KLMS and KRLS suffer from a linear growth in model size with number of training samples. This hampers their applicability to large datasets.
- Existing solutions like sparsification help but don't eliminate this core issue. 

Proposed Solution:
- Define a Random Gaussian RKHS (H_RG) which retains the time structure of a stochastic process, unlike a regular RKHS.
- Use correntropy as an extension of covariance to define time-based functionals in H_RG that capture the statistics. 
- Derive a weight vector using auto and cross-correntropy matrices, analogous to the Wiener solution.
- The weight vector defines a range for a functional in H_RG but doesn't specify where to evaluate it. Propose a heuristic to pick an evaluation point using nearest neighbors.
- This leads to a functional Wiener filter with NN evaluation (FWF_NN) for time series prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective for nonlinear optimal filtering using time-based functionals in an RKHS, moving away from linear growth in model size.
- Introduction of H_RG which retains time structure of stochastic processes.
- Use of correntropy to extend covariance for defining functionals in H_RG.
- Derivation of weight vectors using auto and cross-correntropy matrices.
- Proposal of FWF_NN as a heuristic solution for evaluation and time series prediction.

The main merit of the paper is in the new perspective it provides for nonlinear filtering in an RKHS using time-based functionals, rather than the specific FWF_NN solution. This could open up new research directions to address the existing limitations of KAF methods.
