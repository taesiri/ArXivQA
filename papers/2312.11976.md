# [When Model Meets New Normals: Test-time Adaptation for Unsupervised   Time-series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11976)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time-series anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal observations in temporal data by learning normal patterns. However, the concept of "normal" can evolve over time, leading to distribution shifts between training and test data.
- This causes a "new normal problem", where models fail to adapt to changing dynamics and generate false alarms. Addressing this issue is critical for reliable anomaly detection. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a simple yet effective test-time adaptation strategy to make detectors robust to distribution shifts.
- It uses an exponential moving average (EMA) to estimate trends and adapt to new normals. The observations are detrended by subtracting the EMA estimate before feeding to the model.
- During test-time, the model parameters are updated in a self-supervised manner using predictions on normal instances. This allows the model to learn the changing dynamics over time.

Contributions:
- The paper highlights the prevalence of new normal problems in anomaly detection and the need for adaptation.
- A computationally efficient trend estimation method is proposed to handle abrupt trend shifts.
- A test-time adaptation technique is introduced to make models robust to distribution shifts without any supervision.
- Extensive experiments show consistent improvement over baselines by reducing false alarms on real-world data with shifting trends and dynamics. The framework can be integrated with various anomaly detection models.

In summary, the paper addresses an important problem in anomaly detection, and proposes a simple yet effective solution that improves model robustness by adapting to new normals during inference. The self-supervised test-time adaptation technique is the key novelty that enhances performance on evolving data.
