# [Responsible Visual Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With recent advancements in visual synthesis technology, there is an increasing risk of encountering images with harmful content such as hate, discrimination, or privacy violations. However, the research on transforming such harmful images into responsible ones remains unexplored. Existing image editing methods also require clear and direct user instructions to make specific adjustments, while concepts that need to be edited in responsible image editing are often abstract.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new task called "responsible visual editing", which involves modifying specific concepts in images to make them more responsible while minimizing changes to the image. To address this, the paper presents a Cognitive Editor (CoEditor) model that utilizes a large multimodal model through a two-stage cognitive process:

1) Perceptual cognitive process: Focuses attention on what needs to be modified in the image based on the concept. This is done by creating visual prompts of objects in the image and expanding the concept through language prompts to help the multimodal model locate relevant regions.

2) Behavioral cognitive process: Strategizes how to modify the regions identified. This generates a target image for modification by prompting the multimodal model with the concept instruction along with a cropped region from the image.

The edited region and modification target then serve as inputs to an inpainting model to generate the final responsible image.

To facilitate research and reduce ethical concerns, the paper also introduces a new dataset called AltBear which uses cartoon teddy bears instead of humans to depict risky concepts.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the novel task of responsible visual editing to transform harmful images into responsible ones
- Proposes CoEditor model consisting of perceptual and behavioral cognitive processes powered by a large multimodal model to address abstract concepts
- Creates AltBear dataset that mitigates ethical risks by using fictional teddy bears instead of humans
- Experiments show CoEditor significantly outperforms baselines in responsible editing without compromising image quality or rationality

The work highlights the potential of leveraging large multimodal models for responsible AI through transparent cognitive processes. The introduced concept of responsible visual editing and AltBear dataset pave the way for future work in this important direction.
