# [ViT-CoMer: Vision Transformer with Convolutional Multi-scale Feature   Interaction for Dense Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success on image classification tasks. However, they underperform on dense prediction tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. This is due to two main limitations of ViTs: 1) lack of interaction between local image patches, resulting in insufficient local and spatial information; 2) single-scale feature representation, while dense tasks require multi-scale features. Most existing solutions modify the ViT structure (vision-specific backbones) which prevents using advanced pretrained weights.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes ViT-CoMer, a plain and feature-enhanced ViT backbone that can leverage different pretrained ViT weights. ViT-CoMer has two main components:

1) Multi-Receptive Field Feature Pyramid (MRFP) module which injects multi-scale CNN features into ViT to provide local and spatial information.

2) CNN-Transformer Bidirectional Fusion Interaction (CTI) module which performs feature fusion across CNN and ViT branches in both directions. This enriches the features and enhances modeling capability.

Overall, ViT-CoMer retains the core ViT structure to utilize pretrained weights, while augmenting it with convolutional features and interactions for dense prediction tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a feature-enhanced plain ViT backbone for dense prediction without altering ViT architecture
- Introduces MRFP and CTI modules for fusing CNN and ViT features bidirectionally 
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on object detection and semantic segmentation without extra data
- Demonstrates consistent improvements over baseline ViTs and adapted transformers
- Can leverage advanced pretrained weights like BEiT and DINO for further gains

In summary, ViT-CoMer effectively combines CNN and ViT features while retaining ViT's core design to build a powerful backbone for dense prediction tasks. The model achieves impressive results comparable to state-of-the-art vision-specific backbones.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

ViT-CoMer is a feature-enhanced Vision Transformer backbone that effectively incorporates multi-scale convolutional features to address limitations of Transformers for dense prediction tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance without altering the original ViT architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes ViT-CoMer, a plain, pre-training-free, and feature-enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone for dense prediction tasks. ViT-CoMer injects multi-scale convolutional features into ViT to address the issues of limited local feature interaction and single-scale representation in ViT.

2. It designs two core modules - the Multi-Receptive Field Feature Pyramid (MRFP) module and the CNN-Transformer Bidirectional Fusion Interaction (CTI) module. MRFP captures multi-scale spatial features while CTI performs feature fusion across CNN and Transformer branches to obtain richer semantics. 

3. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of ViT-CoMer on object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. Notably, ViT-CoMer-L achieves 64.3% AP on COCO using advanced pre-training, which is the best result without extra detection data. It also attains 62.1% mIoU on ADE20K comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an adapted ViT backbone called ViT-CoMer that effectively enhances ViT for dense predictions by incorporating multi-scale CNN features and bidirectional fusion, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
