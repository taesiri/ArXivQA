# [I Open at the Close: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Evaluation of Open   Streets Initiatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07680)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses two key problems related to urban traffic management and safety:

1) Accurately predicting traffic collisions in cities to identify high-risk areas. Prior work has limitations in terms of short time frames, downsampling of data, and limited geographic scope.

2) Systematically evaluating and selecting optimal streets to "open" (close to vehicles and open to pedestrians/bikes) to reduce congestion and collisions. Prior work lacks simulations of impact and considerations of safety. 

Proposed Solutions:

1) For collision prediction, the authors propose a Recurrent Graph Neural Network (RGNN) model that captures spatial dependencies with graph convolutions and short-term temporal dynamics with recurrence. They use 3 years of comprehensive NYC data without downsampling.

2) For choosing streets to open, they formulate it as a reinforcement learning problem using deep Q-learning. A trained model outputs long-term value of opening each street segment based on simulated impact on traffic and safety (using collision model from part 1).

Key Contributions:

- State-of-the-art recurrent GNN for granular, city-scale collision prediction using multi-year data

- Novel RL framework to systematically evaluate and optimize open streets selection for congestion/safety  

- Empirical analysis showing model-proposed streets reliably improve outcomes vs actual NYC open streets 

- Model-proposed streets are more equitably distributed geographically than actual open streets

- Framework is generalizable to other cities with available data

In summary, the paper presents an RGNN collision prediction model and a RL-based optimization of open streets selection that outperforms prior art and status quo policies for urban traffic management. The solutions have implications for improving safety and accessibility in cities.
