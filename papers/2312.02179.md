# [Training Chain-of-Thought via Latent-Variable Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) can solve reasoning problems more accurately when prompted to provide a step-by-step "chain of thought" explaining the reasoning process. However, creating detailed reasoning annotations as supervision for training these models is expensive. The paper aims to develop an effective method to train LLMs to generate high-quality reasoning chains without requiring full supervision.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper frames chain-of-thought reasoning as a latent variable model, where the reasoning chain is treated as an unobserved latent variable. It then proposes an algorithm called TRICE that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo expectation maximization to maximize the marginal likelihood of the model generating the correct answer, approximately averaging over all possible reasoning chains. 

Key ideas in TRICE:
- Maintains a memory of reasoning chains, initialized using a guided model
- Iteratively samples new proposed chains from the current model
- Accepts new chains that lead to the correct answer 
- Uses a control variate scheme to reduce gradient variance

The method unifies ideas from prior work like STaR and self-consistency, but enables averaging over chains during training, not just at test time.

Main Contributions:
- Frames chain-of-thought prompting as a latent variable model
- Proposes TRICE, an MCMC-EM approach to train the model without full supervision 
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on GSM8K and BIG-Bench Hard, outperforming STaR, rejection sampling, and even supervised tuning
- Provides a unifying view connecting various lines of work on reasoning with LLMs

The key insight is to treat reasoning chains as latent variables and use Bayesian inference techniques to marginalize over them. This enables effectively training models to generate better reasoning without expensive full supervision.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called TRICE for training language models to generate better step-by-step rationales when solving problems, by framing chain-of-thought prompting as a latent variable model and using Markov chain Monte Carlo expectation maximization to maximize the marginal likelihood of correct answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing TRICE, a method for tuning large language models to better solve question-answering tasks using chain-of-thought prompting. Specifically:

- It frames chain-of-thought prompted LLMs as latent variable models, with the rationale being the latent variable. This allows bringing in probabilistic machine learning techniques for learning with incomplete data.

- It introduces an MCMC expectation-maximization algorithm combined with a control variate scheme to maximize the marginal likelihood of generating the correct answer. This allows "bootstrapping" rationales from question-answer pairs alone during training.

- It unifies several threads of related work on reasoning using LLMs, providing an interpretation of methods like self-taught reasoners and self-consistency from a probabilistic perspective.

- Experiments on GSM8K and BIG-Bench Hard datasets show TRICE outperforms baselines like self-taught reasoners, direct prompt tuning, and rejection sampling in terms of accuracy.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a principled and effective method for tuning LLMs to better generate valid rationales and answers for question-answering tasks. The probabilistic viewpoint and resulting training algorithm are key innovations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Chain-of-thought prompting: Using prompts to get language models to show their reasoning step-by-step to reach an answer.

- Latent-variable models: Treating the rationales generated from chain-of-thought prompting as latent variables in a probabilistic model.

- Marginal likelihood: Optimizing the marginal likelihood of the model generating the correct answer, averaging over possible rationales. 

- Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Using MCMC sampling to approximate averaging over the latent rationale space.

- Expectation-maximization (EM): Framing the learning problem as an EM problem with the latent rationales.

- Control variates: Using control variates to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates.

- Self-taught reasoner (STaR): An existing method for tuning models to generate better rationales that is analyzed in the context of this latent variable view.

- Reweighted wake-sleep (RWS): An alternative learning method that is discussed and found to sometimes have issues with rationale quality.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around latent variable modeling, MCMC, and control variates applied to chain-of-thought prompting in language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does TRICE differ conceptually from other methods like STaR in terms of its interpretation of chain-of-thought prompting as a latent variable model? What implications does this have?

2. Why does viewing chain-of-thought as a latent variable model naturally lead to an MCMC-EM training approach? What are the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC-EM versus variational EM or wake-sleep in this context?

3. Explain the derivation of TRICE's gradient estimator in detail, starting from the gradient of the marginal log-likelihood. Why is an independence sampler a reasonable choice of MCMC kernel here?  

4. Walk through the control variate scheme used in TRICE. Why can it drive the variance of the gradient estimates to zero? How is the control variate weight β estimated in a way that ensures independence?

5. What causes instability and degeneration to empty rationales when applying reweighted wake-sleep in this context? How does the probabilistic view address this?

6. How does the subsampling scheme used in TRICE's gradient estimator relate to importance sampling? Why is it helpful to preferentially sample higher-weight examples?

7. Explain how the gradient estimates based solely on incorrect rationales relate to the true gradients. Why does their variance depend strongly on model accuracy π?

8. How does TRICE differ from rejection sampling? What tradeoffs are involved in tuning the number of particles versus minibatch size?

9. What evidence suggests that STaR may overfit to small training sets by effectively memorizing rationales? How does TRICE differ in a way that mitigates this?  

10. Why might supervised fine-tuning on human-rationales perform worse than TRICE? What relative importance might the loss function place on precise expressiveness versus semantic content?
