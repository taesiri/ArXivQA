# [Next3D: Generative Neural Texture Rasterization for 3D-Aware Head   Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11208)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an editable 3D-aware generator that can synthesize high-fidelity, view-consistent portraits while also supporting local editing of facial attributes.  

The key hypotheses are:

1. Disentangling shape and texture representations enables independent control over geometry and appearance during image generation.

2. Aligning facial semantics, geometry, and texture in a spatial 3D volume allows using semantic guidance to edit the portrait images. 

3. Training on widely available monocular images paired with semantic masks, rather than scarce multi-view data, provides sufficient supervision for learning the 3D generative model.

4. Jointly learning to predict semantics and color in the 3D volume improves geometry quality compared to learning them separately.

So in summary, the main goal is developing a generative 3D portrait model that combines the realism and editing flexibility of 2D GANs with the view consistency of 3D-aware image synthesis. The key ideas are disentangled shape/texture, aligned 3D semantics/geometry/texture, and self-supervised training with monocular data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes FENeRF, the first portrait image generator that is locally editable and strictly view-consistent. This is achieved by learning a 3D representation where the semantics, geometry and texture are spatially-aligned.

2. It trains the generator using widely available monocular images with paired semantic masks, instead of requiring multi-view images or 3D data. This ensures data diversity and enhances the representation ability. 

3. It shows that joint learning of the semantic and texture volumes helps generate finer 3D geometry. 

4. Experiments demonstrate that FENeRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various face editing tasks while maintaining strict 3D consistency.

In summary, this paper presents a novel 3D-aware GAN that can synthesize high-quality, locally editable, and view-consistent portrait images. The key idea is the proposed spatially-aligned 3D representation that aligns semantics, geometry and texture. This enables semantic-guided editing while ensuring view consistency. The generator is trained with abundant monocular image data instead of multi-view supervision. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on tasks like inversion, editing, and style transfer.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D GAN framework called Generative Texture-Rasterized Tri-planes that combines mesh-guided explicit deformation and implicit volumetric representation to synthesize high-quality, animatable, and 3D-consistent facial avatars from unstructured 2D images in an unsupervised manner.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on 3D-aware generative adversarial networks for face image synthesis:

- The key novelty is the proposed Generative Texture-Rasterized Tri-planes representation, which combines mesh-guided explicit deformation (through generative neural textures) with the flexibility of implicit volumetric representations (through rasterization into a tri-plane format). This allows modeling both accurate facial deformation and topological changes like hair and accessories. Most prior work uses either purely explicit or implicit representations, which have limitations.

- Compared to explicit surface deformation methods like GNARF and AniFaceGAN, this approach provides more topological flexibility to handle non-face elements. GNARF uses an explicit surface deformation field which cannot model topology changes. AniFaceGAN uses an implicit deformation field but requires complicated losses to constrain it. The proposed approach naturally achieves good deformation accuracy thanks to the mesh guidance.

- Compared to implicit volumetric methods like pi-GAN and GRAF, this approach allows more fine-grained control over facial deformation through the mesh-guided textures. Fully implicit methods struggle to achieve the same level of detailed control.

- The use of generative neural textures is novel for animatable 3D-aware synthesis. Prior work either uses graphical textures or implicit texture fields. Explicitly modeling the textures provides more direct control.

- The design choices like the teeth completion model and deformation-aware discriminator are unique contributions to improve animation quality and accuracy over prior work.

- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both image quality and animation accuracy metrics. The applications for avatar animation and stylization also showcase the capabilities enabled by this technique.

In summary, the key novelties are in the model representation and architecture design. The experiments demonstrate advancement over other recent methods by combining the benefits of explicit and implicit modeling for animatable 3D-aware face synthesis.
