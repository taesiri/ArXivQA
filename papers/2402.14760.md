# [Generalizing Reward Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Preference learning (PL) aims to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but most work focuses on in-distribution PL. 
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) PL is important to enhance generalization of LLMs with limited preference data.
- Main challenges of OOD PL:
   1) Generations may deviate from target distribution's preferences
   2) Policy drift - policy moves towards training distribution 

Proposed Solution:
- Learn a general reward model via meta-learning that can guide policy optimization for OOD preference learning
- Use a bilevel optimization algorithm
   - Outer loop: optimize preference learning objective to align policy probabilities with human preferences
   - Inner loop: conduct regularized policy optimization using learned reward model
- Add regularization term in policy optimization to mitigate policy drift 

Key Contributions:
- Propose first meta-learning framework to address OOD preference learning
- Design a gradient-based bilevel optimization algorithm and analyze its convergence rate
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on controlled sentiment generation across 4 domains and knowledge answer generation across 18 domains
- Show optimized reward model effectively guides policy learning for OOD alignment with human preferences

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in tackling the key challenge of out-of-distribution preference learning for aligning LLMs along human values. The proposed meta-learning approach optimizes a generalized reward model to guide policy optimization across distribution shifts.
