# [ToolEyes: Fine-Grained Evaluation for Tool Learning Capabilities of   Large Language Models in Real-world Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) for tool learning focus primarily on validating alignment of selected tools with expected outcomes. However, these approaches rely on limited scenarios where answers can be pre-determined, diverging from real-world complexity. Furthermore, solely emphasizing outcomes overlooks intricate capabilities vital for effective tool usage. 

Solution:
The authors propose "ToolEyes", a fine-grained system tailored for evaluating LLMs' tool learning capabilities in authentic scenarios. ToolEyes formulates 7 real-world scenarios covering diverse needs like text generation, data analysis, application manipulation etc. It also builds a tool library with ~600 tools serving as interfaces for LLM-environment interaction. 

Crucially, ToolEyes analyzes five key capability dimensions: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool selection and answer organization. This allows comprehensive examination of the multifaceted tool learning process beyond just assessing tool selection accuracy.

Contributions:
1) A system "ToolEyes" for fine-grained evaluation of LLM tool learning abilities, with 7 scenarios and ~600 tools.

2) In-depth analysis of five capabilities vital for effective LLM tool usage, enabling scrutiny of the intricate tool learning process. 

3) Evaluation of 10 LLMs revealing inclination towards specific scenarios and constrained cognitive abilities, offering insights to advance tool learning research.

In summary, the paper introduces ToolEyes that conducts granular assessment across multiple facets throughout tool learning in authentic settings. Analysis uncovers scenario preferences and thinking skill limitations in existing LLMs, guiding future tool learning developments.
