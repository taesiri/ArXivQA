# [When Large Language Models Meet Vector Databases: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have limitations including hallucinations, high costs for commercial use, and memory/forgetfulness issues. 

- Vector databases (VecDBs) offer efficient storage and retrieval of vector representations of data, but their integration with LLMs is still an emerging area of research.

Proposed Solution:
- Synergize LLMs with VecDBs to overcome LLM limitations and enhance capabilities:
    - VecDBs as external knowledge bases to reduce hallucinations via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    - VecDBs as cost-effective semantic caches to reduce expensive LLM API calls 
    - VecDBs as reliable memories to address LLM forgetfulness

Key Contributions:
- Provides a background on the developments of LLMs and VecDBs, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses
- Proposes using VecDBs in RAG frameworks as domain-specific external memories to ground LLMs, reducing hallucinations
- Discusses employing VecDBs as semantic caches to store vector representations of previous conversations, cutting costly LLM API calls
- Suggests VecDBs can act as memories for LLMs to address forgetfulness issues in conversations 
- Reviews recent innovations in multimodal RAG systems and optimized retrieval methodologies
- Identifies open challenges including combining vector search with traditional DB capabilities, multi-modality, data preprocessing, cost-effective scaling, and knowledge conflict resolution

Overall, the paper systematically explores the integration of VecDBs with LLMs, proposing they can synergistically overcome key LLM limitations, while highlighting opportunities and challenges in this emerging research domain.
