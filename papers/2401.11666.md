# [P2DT: Mitigating Forgetting in task-incremental Learning with   progressive prompt Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Catastrophic forgetting poses a major challenge for large models used to control AI agents in continual learning settings. When faced with new tasks, these models tend to forget previously learned skills. This limits their effectiveness in dynamic real-world environments requiring multi-task learning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. 
- P2DT enhances transformer models by dynamically appending learned "decision tokens" during training on new tasks. This guides the model to develop task-specific policies.
- It has a general transformer block to learn shared patterns plus an expert transformer with task-specific prompts for each job. 
- New prompt tokens are added incrementally as new tasks arise to expand capacity without much parameter increase.

Key Contributions:
- P2DT reduces catastrophic forgetting for continual reinforcement learning scenarios, enabling better multi-task performance.
- It leverages full trajectories from all learned tasks, generating updated task-specific tokens on new jobs to retain prior knowledge.
- Experiments demonstrate P2DT maintains strong performance as tasks incrementally expand, substantially surpassing baseline transformer models.
- Analysis shows the method scales efficiently with low parameter overhead for additional tasks.

In summary, the paper presents a novel Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer using dynamically updated prompts to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Experiments confirm improved continual learning for control tasks, retaining prior knowledge while effectively handling new jobs. The proposed approach is promising for real-world AI agents facing incremental multi-task environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT) method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning by dynamically appending learned prompt tokens during new task training to guide task-specific policies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method called Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings for reinforcement learning. Specifically:

1) P2DT introduces a mechanism with general attention blocks to acquire general knowledge across tasks, and expert attention blocks with learned task prompts to acquire task-specific knowledge. 

2) New task prompts are dynamically added when learning new tasks to expand capacity without significantly increasing model complexity.

3) The method utilizes trajectories collected from all tasks to improve policy learning and generates new task-specific tokens during new task training to retain prior knowledge.

4) Empirical results demonstrate P2DT can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting and maintain high performance with minimal reduction as the number of tasks increases.

In summary, the key innovation is using progressive prompts in the transformer architecture to mitigate forgetting in incremental learning scenarios for control tasks. This allows better scaling to increasing environments compared to prior approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel architecture called Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT). Can you explain in detail the components of this architecture and how they interact with each other? 

2. The P2DT model has separate General Attention Blocks (GAB) and Expert Attention Blocks (EAB). What is the motivation behind having these two types of blocks? What specific roles do they play?

3. The method introduces dynamic prompt tokens that are appended during training on new tasks. How are these prompt tokens initialized and optimized during training? What impact do they have on alleviating catastrophic forgetting?

4. Explain the formulation of the regularization term in the loss function and its role in preventing catastrophic forgetting. How are the Fisher Information Matrix values calculated and used in the regularization term?

5. The paper evaluates P2DT on D4RL medium datasets for Hopper, HalfCheetah and Walker2D environments. Could you analyze the results in Table 1 and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of P2DT based on these?  

6. How does the computational overhead introduced by the progressive prompt tokens in P2DT compare to the overall model size? Provide approximate numbers in terms of parameters and memory footprint.

7. The paper only provides results on a sequential learning setting over 3 environments. How could the evaluation be extended to more tasks or different continual learning scenarios?

8. What other algorithmic approaches exist for mitigating catastrophic forgetting? How does P2DT compare to rehearsal-based methods or regularization-based methods?

9. The method relies on access to offline datasets for all tasks during training. Would P2DT work in an online continual learning setting? If not, how can it be adapted?

10. The Complementary Learning System theory motivated the proposed dual memory architecture. Does P2DT incorporate other aspects of the theory related to memory consolidation or hippocampal indexing?
