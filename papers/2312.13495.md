## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Decoupling Representation and Knowledge for Few-Shot Intent Classification and Slot Filling":

Problem:
- Natural language understanding (NLU) includes intent classification and slot filling. Both tasks rely on large labeled datasets which are difficult to obtain. 
- Few-shot learning has been used where models first train on labeled source domains, then get evaluated on target domains with scarce labeled data.
- However, directly transferring experience from source domains to target domains is difficult due to domain gaps. For example, transferring domain-specific knowledge related experience like intent-slot relations is hard.

Proposed Solution: 
- Explicitly decouple the transferring of general semantic representations and domain-specific knowledge between domains.
- Only transfer general semantic representations across domains. Apply target-domain specific knowledge to the transferred representations.  
- Propose Joint Modeling with Relationship Masking (JMRM) method:
    - I2S-Mask module: Captures intent-slot relations using a score matrix summarized from labeled data. Regularizes intent and slot predictions.
    - Masked Slot Decoding: Captures slot-slot relations using a score matrix from BIO annotation rules. Constrains slot predictions to be valid sequences.
- These modules are applied during both source domain training (to enable decoupling) and target domain evaluation (to apply target domain knowledge).

Main Contributions:
- Propose to explicitly decouple transferring general representations and domain-specific knowledge between domains to address transfer difficulties. 
- Design I2S-Mask and Masked Slot Decoding modules to capture domain knowledge using relationship score matrices.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on few-shot NLU. Improve joint accuracy significantly on two datasets over baselines.
- Demonstrate decoupling transferring knowledge is more effective than transferring as a whole.
