# Phoenix: Democratizing ChatGPT across Languages

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we democratize access to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT across languages?The authors aim to develop open-source LLMs that can perform well across many languages, including low-resource non-Latin languages. Their goal is to make conversational AI systems more accessible globally. Specifically, some key aspects the paper investigates are:- Training multi-lingual LLMs using a combination of instruction datasets and conversation datasets in 40+ languages.- Comparing the performance of their model "Phoenix" to other existing democratized LLMs like Guanaco and Vicuna in languages like Chinese, English, Arabic, etc.- Releasing the models, data, and code openly to facilitate further research into democratized LLMs.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by leveraging diverse multi-lingual data and training strategies, they can develop an open-source LLM "Phoenix" that achieves strong performance across many languages, thereby helping to democratize access to conversational AI.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Introducing a new large language model called "Phoenix" that aims to democratize access to ChatGPT-like models across languages. The model supports both Latin and non-Latin languages. 2. Using a combination of instruction data and conversation data to train Phoenix in a multi-lingual setting. This incorporates the benefits of both instruction tuning and conversation tuning.3. Achieving state-of-the-art performance among fully open source Chinese language models. Phoenix also outperforms existing open source models in many non-Latin languages.4. Releasing "Chimera", a Latin-specific version of Phoenix built on the LLaMA backbone, which achieves very competitive performance in English compared to other democratized models.5. Providing extensive benchmarking of existing democratized LLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. This allows systematic comparison across models.6. Making the training data, code, and models openly available to continue the democratization process. This will allow others to replicate, evaluate and build upon this work.In summary, the main contribution seems to be releasing a new competitive open source multi-lingual model to expand access to ChatGPT-like capabilities across languages, especially for non-Latin languages and users who cannot access proprietary models. The combination of instruction and conversation data, benchmarking, and open release also represent key contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces efforts by the authors to democratize access to large language models like ChatGPT by training and releasing a multilingual model called Phoenix. The key ideas are using both instruction and conversation data for fine-tuning, building on a multilingual pretrained backbone, and supporting many languages during training to make the technology more accessible globally.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field:Novelty of the approach: This paper presents a new method/framework/model for democratizing access to large language models across languages. The idea of leveraging both instruction and conversation data for multi-lingual training appears to be novel compared to prior work focused on either instructions or conversations in mostly English. Multi-lingual focus: A key distinction of this work is the emphasis on supporting many languages, including non-Latin scripts. Most prior democratization efforts have focused only on English or a few other Latin languages. Supporting under-resourced languages expands access.Effectiveness: The results demonstrate the method is effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open source models for Chinese. The Latin version also shows strong results for English compared to other democratized models.Limitations: The scope seems limited to text applications. Other recent work explores democratizing LLMs for modalities like images. The evaluations are also still fairly preliminary/limited.Openness: The authors are releasing the trained models, which increases transparency and facilitates community replicability. This aligns with the goals of democratization.Overall, this paper makes contributions in expanding democratized LLMs to more languages in an open and effective manner. The novelty of the multi-lingual training approach and release of models help advance the field. Limitations include scope and scale of evaluation. But it provides a solid step toward more inclusive AI.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more robust evaluation metrics and benchmarks for dialogue systems. The authors note the challenges in properly evaluating dialogue systems and suggest developing better automatic metrics as well as human evaluation protocols.- Exploring new dialogue learning paradigms like reinforcement learning, adversarial learning, meta-learning etc. The traditional supervised learning approach has limitations, so the authors suggest more advanced learning frameworks that can lead to better generalization.- Leveraging external knowledge sources to improve reasoning and grounding. The authors propose using external knowledge bases, text corpora, common sense knowledge etc. to enhance the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of dialogue agents.- Studying social dialogue abilities like displaying empathy, personality and engagement. Current systems lack many attributes of human social conversation, so research on modeling socio-emotional intelligence could make systems more natural.- Investigating visually grounded dialogue tasks. Much human conversation involves visual context, so incorporating vision alongside language could enable more realistic dialogue.- Scaling up current approaches to much larger datasets and neural architectures. The authors recommend leveraging large pretrained LMs and training on huge conversational datasets to push forward performance.- Exploring personalized dialogue agents. Most current systems are designed for general chit-chat - the authors suggest exploring personalization to tailor systems to individual users.In summary, the authors recommend research directions that can enhance robustness, generalization, reasoning, social intelligence and personalized abilities of dialogue agents through innovations in models, learning paradigms, evaluation, and use of external knowledge. Advancing these aspects could lead to more human-like conversational AI.
