## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge-based systems for decision support face challenges in preserving coherence and soundness of knowledge bases. Interpretability and human-understandable logic are essential for driving assistance systems. 
- Formal verification is important for knowledge-based systems related to security issues.  
- Collecting accident videos directly from cars would be unethical. Using only deep learning for video analysis lacks comprehensiveness with limited data.

Proposed Solution:
- Extract knowledge-based logic that defines risky driving formats from public transportation accident datasets. This knowledge is useful for recognizing hazards.
- Use automated verification methods to verify robustness of the logic.
- Gather 72 accident datasets from Data.gov and organize by state. 
- Train decision tree and XGBoost models on each state's data to derive accident judgment logic.
- Deploy robustness verification on tree-based models under multiple parameter combinations.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive collation and analysis of large-scale US traffic accident data.
- Extract human-understandable rule logic to support driving tasks and even safety-critical AI tasks.
- Provide suggestions on unified accident data collection across states.
- Apply robustness verification on tree-based models trained on accident data.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed solution methodology, and highlights the three main contributions made in the paper. It describes the technical details in a way that is easy for a human to understand.
