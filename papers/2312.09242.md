 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces Text2Immersion, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, photorealistic 3D scenes from text prompts. The key innovation is the use of 3D Gaussians as the underlying 3D representation, which enables real-time rendering speeds and superior quality compared to other representations like meshes or neural radiance fields. The proposed pipeline has two main stages - coarse 3D Gaussian initialization using anchor camera views and monocular depth estimation, followed by refinement via inpainting and super-resolution to fill in missing regions and enhance details. A core finding is that the Gaussian training process itself, especially split-and-clone operations, acts as an adaptive 3D representation suitable for inpainting and super-resolution with only 2D supervision. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the approach's ability to produce consistent, high-quality scenes across varying prompts with better image quality, text-image alignment, and 3D consistency than existing methods. Limitations include depth estimation errors causing misalignments and ghosting artifacts during refinement. Key contributions are leveraging Gaussian properties for multi-stage generation, achieving real-time rendering of high-fidelity 3D scenes from text, and advancing the state of the art in text-driven immersive scene generation.
