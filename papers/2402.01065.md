# [Evaluation Methodology for Large Language Models for Multilingual   Document Question and Answer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01065)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT tend to perform well on English and high-resource languages but their performance degrades on low-resource languages.  
- Enabling multilingual support in LLMs is an active area of research to allow their widespread adoption globally. 

Proposed Solution
- The paper evaluates multilingual capabilities of GPT models on question answering using datasets like XQuAD, SQuAD, ESG, and HeQ across 12 languages.
- They propose a methodology to test LLM quality by selecting context-question-answer samples, querying the LLM to answer questions, and asking the LLM to verify if its answer is correct.
- They conduct experiments by translating components like context, questions, and answers to stress test the multilingual capabilities.

Key Findings
- GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 on multilingual QA across all tests.
- Operating in English produces the best results - translation introduces errors. 
- Translating non-English datasets to English improves accuracy of GPT-4.
- GPT-4 shows decent accuracy on Hebrew dataset HeQ, further improving with translation to English.

Main Contributions  
- Proposed evaluation methodology for testing multilingual QA abilities of LLMs.
- Benchmarked multilingual performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- Provided recommendations like operating in English wherever possible in multilingual applications.

In summary, the paper systematically evaluated the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for QA and made recommendations to build robust multilingual applications using these models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the multilingual capability of large language models on question answering tasks using various datasets, and finds that translating text to English generally produces the best performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a methodology for evaluating the multilingual capability of large language models (LLMs) on question answering tasks. Specifically:

- They evaluate LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on question answering using datasets in multiple languages - English, Spanish, German, Greek, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi, Dutch, and Hebrew.

- They test translation at different points in the pipeline - translating the context/questions/answers to the model's language or translating the model's answers to the user's language. 

- They find that operating in English yields the best performance if possible, even if translation is required. The latest models like GPT-4 perform much better than previous versions.

- They conclude with recommendations on using translation vs operating in English, the performance gap between LLMs, and challenges with out-of-domain datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is a methodology and experiments for evaluating how well current LLMs can perform question answering in languages other than English, under different translation conditions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an evaluation methodology for testing the quality of question-answering by large language models. Can you explain in more detail the components of this methodology and how the context, question, and answers are processed at each step? 

2. The paper experiments with different datasets like XQuAD, SQuAD, ESG, and HeQ. Can you compare and contrast these datasets in terms of size, languages, context sources, etc.? How do these differences impact the evaluation results?

3. The paper translates components like context, questions, and answers between languages at different points. Can you diagram the full pipeline and highlight where translations occur? What are the tradeoffs between translating different components?

4. The results show better performance when operating in English versus other languages. What explanations are provided for this finding? Are there ways this language barrier could be reduced? 

5. The paper finds a large performance gap between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. Can you quantify this gap with some accuracy metrics? What GPT capabilities lead to these differences?

6. For the ESG dataset, PDF documents are converted to text. How does this impact the context quality compared to plain text datasets? How do translation effects compound the context noise?

7. The HeQ dataset focuses on Hebrew language and culture, unlikely to be in GPT training data. How do the models, particularly GPT-4, still achieve decent accuracy? What technique further improves results?

8. The paper mentions early stopping of translations leading to chopped contexts. What underlying causes would lead to this behavior? How prevalent is this issue across contexts and models?

9. Can you critique the testing prompt formulations used to query the GPT models? What are some best practices for prompt engineering when evaluating models?

10. The paper focuses on question answering, but also mentions use cases like summarization. What additional metrics and tests would be needed to evaluate different task performance?
