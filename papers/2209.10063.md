# [Generate rather than Retrieve: Large Language Models are Strong Context   Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10063)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. The paper seems to present a method called "GenRead", which replaces the document retrieval component in a "retrieve-then-read" pipeline with generating documents using a large language model. The key ideas appear to be:- Proposing to use large language models like GPT-3 to generate contextual documents for a given question, instead of retrieving relevant documents from a corpus like Wikipedia. - A "generate-then-read" pipeline where documents are first generated by the language model conditioned on the question, then read by the model to produce the final answer.- A clustering-based prompting method to generate multiple diverse documents covering different perspectives and improve recall of possible answers. - Evaluating the "generate-then-read" approach on question answering, fact checking, and dialogue tasks, showing it can match or exceed retrieve-then-read pipelines without any document retrieval.- Showing generated documents complement retrieved documents, and combining both further improves performance.So in summary, there is no single focused research question stated, but the central hypothesis appears to be that generating documents with large language models can effectively replace or augment document retrieval for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate and analyze this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel "generate-then-read" pipeline for solving knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. This replaces the standard "retrieve-then-read" pipeline by using a large language model to generate relevant documents for a given question, rather than retrieving documents from an external corpus. 2. A clustering-based prompting method to generate multiple diverse documents covering different perspectives related to the question. This increases the likelihood of generating documents containing the correct answer compared to sampling methods.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods on several knowledge-intensive tasks including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue under both zero-shot and supervised settings. The generated documents alone can match or exceed performance of retrieve-then-read methods without using any external corpus.4. Showing that combining retrieved and generated documents leads to further performance improvements, suggesting they provide complementary knowledge.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and validating a generate-then-read paradigm for knowledge-intensive NLP that can rival or exceed traditional retrieve-then-read pipelines by extracting knowledge directly from large language model parameters. The clustering prompting method further improves the coverage and diversity of the generated documents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel generate-then-read pipeline for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks that replaces document retrieval with prompting a large language model to generate relevant contexts, and shows this approach matches or exceeds performance of retrieve-then-read methods without using any external corpora.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a novel "generate-then-read" pipeline for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The key idea is to use large language models to generate relevant context documents, rather than retrieving documents from an external corpus like most prior work. - Prior work on knowledge-intensive NLP has focused heavily on retrieve-then-read pipelines. For example, ORQA, REALM, DPR, RAG, and FiD first retrieve documents using either sparse or dense methods, then read the documents to predict an answer. This paper shows that replacing retrieval with generation can match or exceed performance.- Some recent work has explored using language models for document retrieval, but mainly by generating document identifiers like titles rather than full text. This paper generates complete context documents without any metadata, showing the full knowledge is accessible from the model parameters.- Other work has used language models to generate intermediate reasoning chains or supplemental facts to assist in QA. This paper instead targets generating the full contextual documents, which is a harder task but provides more comprehensive external knowledge to the reader model.- The idea of conditioning a language model answer on generated text shares similarity with chain-of-thought prompting. But this paper focuses on knowledge retrieval for existing factual QA datasets rather than commonsense reasoning tasks.- For evaluation, the paper compares to state-of-the-art retriever-reader models on established QA benchmarks like TriviaQA and NQ. The gains over directly reading as well as complementary performance with retrieval demonstrate the utility of this approach.In summary, this paper makes a novel contribution in replacing the traditional document retrieval step with generation using large language models. The comprehensive experiments and gains over strong baselines validate this new paradigm for knowledge-intensive NLP.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Exploring potential bias and intentional or unintentional harm that may result from using generated contextual documents. The authors state there is more work needed in this area to further improve fairness of the models.- Better aligning language models with user intent to generate less biased contents and fewer fabricated facts. The authors acknowledge generated documents may suffer from hallucination errors leading to incorrect predictions.- Incorporating recent approaches to boost generative faithfulness and reduce hallucinations. The authors note their method relies solely on the language model which may enhance existing biases compared to retrieval augmented methods. - Updating knowledge state and adapting to new domains. The authors state their approach relies on the knowledge in the pre-trained model, while retrieved documents can be swapped out. Future work could explore efficiently incorporating new knowledge.- Exploring a wider range of knowledge-intensive tasks beyond the three in the paper. The authors suggest their conclusions may not generalize and encourage applying the framework to other large language models and tasks.In summary, the main suggested directions are: exploring potential harms, improving faithfulness, adapting knowledge, evaluating on more tasks, and combining with retrieval. The authors aim to establish this generate-then-read approach as a promising new paradigm but note limitations around bias, outdated knowledge, and generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel generate-then-read pipeline for solving knowledge-intensive NLP tasks like open-domain question answering. Instead of relying on an external retriever to find relevant documents from a corpus like Wikipedia, the method prompts a large language model to generate contextual documents based on the question. This takes advantage of the world knowledge contained in the model's parameters. To improve coverage of possible answers, they propose a clustering-based prompting approach that samples question-document demonstrations from diverse clusters to elicit different perspectives in the generated text. Without using any retrieved documents, their method called GenRead matches or exceeds retrieve-then-read pipelines on open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue tasks under both zero-shot and supervised settings. It significantly outperforms previous methods on TriviaQA and WebQuestions. They also show performance can be further improved by combining retrieved and generated documents. The findings demonstrate large language models' strong ability for contextual document generation and their complementarity with dense retrievers.
