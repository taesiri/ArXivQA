# [Does provable absence of barren plateaus imply classical simulability?   Or, why we need to rethink variational quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09121)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This perspective article argues that commonly used variational quantum algorithms that provably avoid barren plateaus can also be efficiently simulated classically, potentially calling into question their usefulness. The core argument is that barren plateaus arise from a curse of dimensionality when comparing exponentially large quantum states. Strategies to mitigate barren plateaus, like using shallow circuits or encoding symmetries, restrict the problem to live in smaller, polynomially-sized subspaces that can be simulated classically. After reviewing several proposed barren plateau-free architectures, the authors show how the structure that avoids concentration also enables classical simulation, requiring only limited data from a quantum device. They discuss caveats around anomalous parameters and smart initialization, noting the latter may enable superpolynomial speedups. Overall, the results indicate conventional variational schemes likely cannot achieve quantum advantage, necessitating new approaches that manipulate information in a structured way across the full exponential space.
