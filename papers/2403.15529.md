# [LimGen: Probing the LLMs for Generating Suggestive Limitations of   Research Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Reviewing research papers to identify limitations is tedious and time-consuming, requiring expertise and attention to detail. Generating insightful limitations poses a challenge even for models. 

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces a new task of Suggestive Limitation Generation (SLG) for research papers to assist reviewers. A dataset called LimGen is created from 4068 ACL anthology papers and corresponding limitations. Several schemes are proposed to harness large language models (LLMs) to produce suggestive limitations:

1) Fine-tuning summarization models like BART and PEGASUS 
2) Leveraging generative LLMs like T5, Llama 2, Cerebras GPT with prompting
3) Using Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve relevant passages from papers to provide localized context
4) A 2-stage chain modeling approach involving DPR context passage input to an LLM to generate limitations, followed by distillation of outputs by another LLM.

Key Contributions:

1) First work to propose the novel and challenging task of SLG to generate insightful limitations for research papers.  

2) Release of LimGen, the first dataset of 4068 ACL anthology papers mapped to limitations.

3) Thorough investigation of limitations generation capability of several SOTA LLMs using summarization, prompting and passage retrieval schemes.

4) In-depth quantitative evaluation using automated metrics, qualitative analysis via LLM-assisted assessment and human evaluation.

The best performing model utilizes chain modeling with DPR and summary context, outperforming summarization and standalone generative schemes. The paper discusses the complexity of SLG, analysis of the limitations in papers, efficacy of evaluation metrics, and future opportunities.
