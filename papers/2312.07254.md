# [The GUA-Speech System Description for CNVSRC Challenge 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07254)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper describes a visual speech recognition system submitted to the Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge (CNVSRC) 2023 for the single-speaker fixed track task. The proposed system consists of a visual front-end, 12 Conformer encoder blocks with 3 intermediate CTC residual (Inter CTC) modules, a bi-transformer decoder, and a CTC layer. Inter CTC helps relax CTC's independence assumptions while the bi-transformer decoder enables capturing bidirectional context. Chinese characters are used as modeling units to improve accuracy. For training, curriculum learning is employed starting with short utterances, then all of CN-CVS, and finally the CNVSRC-Single.Dev dataset. Experiments show the system achieves a character error rate (CER) of 38.09% on the eval set, a 21.63% relative improvement over the baseline. Ablations quantify gains from Inter CTC, the bi-transformer decoder, Chinese character modeling, and the language model. Adding more CNVSRC-Single.Dev training data is shown to improve accuracy. The system reached second place in the challenge through the proposed techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes a visual speech recognition system using intermediate CTC residual modules, a bi-transformer decoder, Chinese characters as modeling units, and an RNN language model for shallow fusion, achieving a 21.63% relative character error rate reduction over the baseline on the evaluation set.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a visual speech recognition (VSR) system that achieves improved performance over the baseline on the CNVSRC 2023 challenge. Specifically:

- They propose using Intermediate Connectionist Temporal Classification (Inter CTC) residual modules in the encoder to relax the conditional independence assumption of CTC and improve conditioning of predictions.

- They use a bi-transformer decoder to enable capturing bidirectional context. 

- They use Chinese characters as modeling units to improve recognition accuracy.

- They use an RNN language model for shallow fusion during inference.

- Through these methods, their proposed system achieves a 21.63% relative reduction in character error rate over the official baseline on the CNVSRC 2023 eval set.

So in summary, the main contribution is an improved VSR system leveraging multiple techniques (Inter CTC, bi-transformer decoder, character units, RNN LM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CNVSRC 2023 challenge.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper tackles the task of single-speaker visual speech recognition (VSR), specifically for Chinese speech. Visual speech recognition aims to convert lip movements captured in video to text transcriptions. This is a challenging problem especially for tonal languages like Chinese.

Proposed Solution:
- They propose an end-to-end model consisting of:
    - Visual front-end to extract spatio-temporal features from video frames 
    - Conformer encoder blocks with Intermediate CTC (Inter CTC) residual modules to relax conditional independence assumption of CTC
    - Bidirectional transformer decoder to capture past and future contexts
    - CTC layer for an auxiliary CTC loss 
    - RNN language model for inference stage shallow fusion
- They use Chinese characters as modeling units to improve recognition accuracy.  
- The model is trained with curriculum learning strategy on CN-CVS and CNVSRC-Single.Dev datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes intermediate CTC (Inter CTC) residual modules inside Conformer encoders to improve CTC modeling by conditioning predictions and relaxing independence assumptions.
- Employs a bidirectional transformer decoder to enable capturing bidirectional contexts. 
- Uses Chinese characters as modeling units to improve recognition accuracy for tonal language.
- Achieves relative 21.63% CER reduction over baseline on Eval set and obtains 2nd place in CNVSRC 2023 challenge.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end Conformer-based model with novel Inter CTC modules and bidirectional decoding for Chinese VSR task. The techniques help improve conditional independence limitations of CTC and model bidirectional context to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.
