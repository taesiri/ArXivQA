# [The GUA-Speech System Description for CNVSRC Challenge 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07254)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper describes a visual speech recognition system submitted to the Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge (CNVSRC) 2023 for the single-speaker fixed track task. The proposed system consists of a visual front-end, 12 Conformer encoder blocks with 3 intermediate CTC residual (Inter CTC) modules, a bi-transformer decoder, and a CTC layer. Inter CTC helps relax CTC's independence assumptions while the bi-transformer decoder enables capturing bidirectional context. Chinese characters are used as modeling units to improve accuracy. For training, curriculum learning is employed starting with short utterances, then all of CN-CVS, and finally the CNVSRC-Single.Dev dataset. Experiments show the system achieves a character error rate (CER) of 38.09% on the eval set, a 21.63% relative improvement over the baseline. Ablations quantify gains from Inter CTC, the bi-transformer decoder, Chinese character modeling, and the language model. Adding more CNVSRC-Single.Dev training data is shown to improve accuracy. The system reached second place in the challenge through the proposed techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes a visual speech recognition system using intermediate CTC residual modules, a bi-transformer decoder, Chinese characters as modeling units, and an RNN language model for shallow fusion, achieving a 21.63% relative character error rate reduction over the baseline on the evaluation set.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a visual speech recognition (VSR) system that achieves improved performance over the baseline on the CNVSRC 2023 challenge. Specifically:

- They propose using Intermediate Connectionist Temporal Classification (Inter CTC) residual modules in the encoder to relax the conditional independence assumption of CTC and improve conditioning of predictions.

- They use a bi-transformer decoder to enable capturing bidirectional context. 

- They use Chinese characters as modeling units to improve recognition accuracy.

- They use an RNN language model for shallow fusion during inference.

- Through these methods, their proposed system achieves a 21.63% relative reduction in character error rate over the official baseline on the CNVSRC 2023 eval set.

So in summary, the main contribution is an improved VSR system leveraging multiple techniques (Inter CTC, bi-transformer decoder, character units, RNN LM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CNVSRC 2023 challenge.
