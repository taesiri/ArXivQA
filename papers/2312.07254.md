# [The GUA-Speech System Description for CNVSRC Challenge 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07254)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper describes a visual speech recognition system submitted to the Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge (CNVSRC) 2023 for the single-speaker fixed track task. The proposed system consists of a visual front-end, 12 Conformer encoder blocks with 3 intermediate CTC residual (Inter CTC) modules, a bi-transformer decoder, and a CTC layer. Inter CTC helps relax CTC's independence assumptions while the bi-transformer decoder enables capturing bidirectional context. Chinese characters are used as modeling units to improve accuracy. For training, curriculum learning is employed starting with short utterances, then all of CN-CVS, and finally the CNVSRC-Single.Dev dataset. Experiments show the system achieves a character error rate (CER) of 38.09% on the eval set, a 21.63% relative improvement over the baseline. Ablations quantify gains from Inter CTC, the bi-transformer decoder, Chinese character modeling, and the language model. Adding more CNVSRC-Single.Dev training data is shown to improve accuracy. The system reached second place in the challenge through the proposed techniques.
