# [AirCrab: A Hybrid Aerial-Ground Manipulator with An Active Wheel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing aerial manipulators face challenges in achieving robust and accurate manipulation due to position drift, attitude oscillations, and limitations of onboard sensors. Although equipping aerial vehicles with multiple wheels (hybrid aerial-ground manipulators) helps improve accuracy through exploiting surface contact, current designs require multiple contact points, adding weight and hindering operation on narrow terrain.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes AirCrab, a hybrid aerial-ground manipulator with a single active wheel inspired by the standing behavior of egrets. The lightweight active wheel reduces position drift via ground contact and enables locomotion on narrow terrain without compromising aerial efficiency. To maintain stable attitude on the ground, a control allocation method is designed that dynamically adjusts propeller thrust to prioritize attitude control while reducing energy use.

Contributions:
1) A hybrid aerial-ground robot design with a single active wheel and 3DoF manipulator. Lightweight and suitable for narrow terrain.

2) Dynamics modeling and control strategies for the robot. Proposed control allocation method maintains attitude by propellers and minimizes thrust for efficiency.  

3) Experiments validated attitude control performance, energy savings, and high manipulation accuracy with ground contact.

4) Demonstrated robotic missions of picking, aerial transport and placing objects to form "NTU" letters. Showcased capability in accurate hybrid aerial-ground manipulation.

In summary, this paper presented the AirCrab design that exploits ground contact through a single wheel to enable accurate manipulation on narrow terrain. The control strategies and experiments proved increased robustness and energy efficiency. Challenging robotic missions demonstrated AirCrab's capabilities in hybrid aerial-ground operation.
