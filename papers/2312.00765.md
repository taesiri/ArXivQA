# [Explaining Knock-on Effects of Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00765)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper empirically examines the unintended "waterfall" effects of applying various bias mitigation strategies to machine learning models, beyond looking just at aggregate fairness metrics. The authors treat the effects of interventions as a classification task and train an explainable meta-classifier to uncover impacted cohorts. Using multiple datasets and mitigation methods working at different stages of the pipeline, they demonstrate that all strategies negatively impact a non-trivial number of individuals by changing their previously favorable outcomes, despite improvements in fairness metrics. Some techniques like Reject Option Classification (ROC) consistently perform better than others like Learning Fair Representations (LFR). The meta-classifier is able to provide interpretable descriptions of affected cohorts in the form of decision rules, though its precision varies based on the cohort sample sizes. Overall, the paper argues for more careful auditing of bias mitigation effects on individuals, not just groups, to avoid unjustified harm.
