# [Language Modeling Is Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10668)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that large language models can be viewed as powerful general-purpose compressors due to their strong predictive capabilities. Specifically, the authors investigate the lossless compression performance of large language models like Chinchilla when used in conjunction with arithmetic coding. The key questions explored in the paper are:

- How do the compression rates of large language models compare to classical compressors like gzip and specialized compressors like PNG/FLAC across different data modalities (text, image, audio)? 

- What insights does the compression viewpoint provide about model scaling laws and dataset size? 

- How does tokenization, which can be viewed as a pre-compression step, affect the final compression performance?

- Can compressors like gzip be used as conditional generative models by employing them to assign probabilities for sequence prediction?

Overall, the paper aims to provide a novel perspective on language modeling by framing it as a compression task and highlighting the equivalence between prediction and compression. The compression lens allows the authors to study the capabilities and limitations of large language models in a principled information-theoretic manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Advocating for viewing prediction through the lens of compression. The paper shows the equivalence between prediction and compression, and argues that framing self-supervised prediction as compression provides insights into model generalization.

- Empirically evaluating the compression capabilities of large language models. The paper demonstrates that models like Chinchilla, while trained primarily on text, can achieve state-of-the-art compression performance on different modalities like images and audio by using their context. 

- Providing a novel perspective on model scaling laws. The compression viewpoint shows that scaling model size is limited by dataset size, since the model parameters need to be accounted for in the compressed output.

- Demonstrating that compressors can be used as conditional generative models. The prediction-compression equivalence allows employing any compressor (like gzip) as a generative model.

- Showing that tokenization acts as a pre-compression and does not necessarily improve compression performance, but allows packing more information into the context.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper argues that large language models like Chinchilla are effective general-purpose compressors when used with arithmetic coding, demonstrating strong compression performance across modalities like text, images, and audio despite primarily being trained on text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on compressing data with neural networks:

- It focuses specifically on using large pretrained language models (like Chinchilla) for compression, rather than training neural networks from scratch. This leverages the impressive in-context learning abilities of these huge foundation models.

- It advocates viewing compression through the lens of prediction and generalization. Good compression requires good prediction, so compression performance provides insights into models' generalization abilities.  

- It provides an extensive empirical evaluation of compression performance across modalities like text, images, and audio. Most prior work focused just on text compression. The results show these pretrained models compress well even on data they were not trained on.

- It highlights the importance of model size and dataset size for optimal compression. Large models can compress better but have a huge parameter cost. The dataset size limits how large a model can practically get. Prior work did not analyze this tradeoff in depth.

- It shows tokenization acts like a pre-compression that allows packing more information into the model's context at the cost of a harder prediction task. This characterization of tokenization is novel.

Overall, this paper connects compression more tightly to recent language model research than prior work. It leverages the capabilities of these huge pretrained models rather than training small models from scratch. The compression viewpoint provides a new perspective on factors like model scaling, generalization, and tokenization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating the in-context learning abilities of foundation models more thoroughly through the lens of compression. The authors show these models can adapt very quickly to compress new data modalities, and suggest further probing this phenomenon.

- Developing better ways to scale up model size and context length while maintaining good compression performance. The paper shows there are limits to naive scaling, so new techniques may be needed.

- Applying the compression viewpoint more broadly to understand self-supervised learning. The authors argue compression provides insights into generalization, so it could shed light on other self-supervised objectives.

- Leveraging the compression-prediction equivalence more for conditional generation. The paper shows even simple compressors can be turned into generative models. More complex compressors like foundation models may enable better controllable generation.

- Designing new compression techniques tailored to neural networks, such as compressing model parameters more effectively. The authors note model size is a key limitation, providing motivation for specialized compression methods.

- Exploring the interplay between tokenization and compression more thoroughly. The paper suggests tokenization acts as a preprocessor, but more work is needed to understand this relationship.

In summary, the main themes are using compression to better understand foundation models, developing techniques to scale these models more effectively, and applying the prediction-compression connection to domains like generation and model compression. The equivalence between prediction and compression provides a useful lens for future self-supervised learning research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "Language Modeling Is Compression":

The paper advocates viewing prediction through the lens of compression, showing the equivalence between probabilistic models and lossless compressors. The authors empirically investigate the compression capabilities of large language models like Chinchilla when used with arithmetic coding. They find that these models, even though primarily trained on text, can achieve state-of-the-art compression rates across modalities like images and audio by using their context to adapt to the task at hand. The compression viewpoint also provides insights into scaling laws, indicating that compression performance eventually decreases when scaling up model size on a fixed dataset due to the parameter cost. Overall, the paper argues that the prediction-compression connection is useful for studying issues like generalization in large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper "Language Modeling is Compression":

The paper advocates viewing language modeling through the lens of data compression. It shows how predictive models like large Transformer networks can be transformed into powerful general-purpose compressors using arithmetic coding. Although models like Chinchilla are trained primarily on text data, they can compress images and audio to state-of-the-art levels by using their context to adapt to the task at hand. The compression viewpoint also provides insights into model scaling laws and tokenization. Specifically, compression rates account for model size, indicating scaling laws depend on dataset size and that tokenization acts as a pre-compression step. Overall, the paper argues prediction and compression are equivalent - maximizing log-likelihood minimizes code length. It provides empirical evidence that large language models are strong compressors, even on non-textual data. Framing prediction as compression encompasses generalization, since models that compress well, generalize well.

In more detail, the paper first reviews how arithmetic coding can turn a predictive model into an optimal lossless compressor. It shows the cross-entropy training objective for language models directly minimizes the expected compression length. Despite being trained on text, 70B parameter models like Chinchilla achieve state-of-the-art compression rates on images and audio by using in-context learning to adapt to new data. The compression viewpoint provides a novel perspective on model scaling laws. By accounting for model size in the compressed output, compression rates reveal there is an optimal model size for a given dataset size. The model size cannot be scaled indefinitely if compression performance is to be maintained. Finally, the paper demonstrates tokenization acts as a pre-compression step. While it harms compression rates, it allows more information to be packed into the context. Overall, the paper advocates for a compression view of prediction, arguing that models which compress well, generalize well.

- Extending the context length of models like Transformers to handle longer sequences. The authors note current context lengths are limited, which restricts the compression performance on some tasks requiring longer memory. Methods to extend the context could improve compression.

- Using the compression viewpoint to study other aspects of foundation models like their inductive biases, generalization abilities, and failure modes during in-context learning. The authors argue the compression perspective provides a novel lens compared to just evaluating predictive performance.

- Leveraging the prediction-compression equivalence more for conditional generative modeling. The authors show compressors can be used as generative models. This could be explored further, e.g. for controllable generation.

- Applying compression more to understand self-supervised pretraining objectives. The authors note current pretraining is equivalent to maximum compression training. The compression viewpoint could give insights into other self-supervised approaches.

- Developing online neural compression algorithms that train only on the data stream to be compressed, while remaining performant. The authors note offline compression with fixed parameters has limitations.

In summary, the main suggestions are to scale up compression experiments, use compression to better understand foundation models, and explore compression more thoroughly for generative modeling and self-supervised learning. The compression viewpoint provides a new perspective complementary to standard predictive modeling.
