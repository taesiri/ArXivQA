# [Reason2Drive: Towards Interpretable and Chain-based Reasoning for   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03661)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (VLMs) have potential for autonomous driving systems due to advanced reasoning abilities. However, research is hindered by lack of datasets with annotated reasoning chains explaining decision-making processes. 
- Existing datasets oversimplify complex driving processes into basic QA tasks with closed-form answers. They lack multi-step chains covering perception, prediction and reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Reason2Drive, a new benchmark with over 600K video-text pairs for interpretable reasoning in complex driving scenarios.
- Builds on diverse open-source driving datasets like nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE using an extensible annotation schema.
- Includes automated annotations and manual verification to ensure diversity. 
- Distinctly characterizes autonomous driving as sequential steps of perception, prediction and reasoning.
- Proposes a novel evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance, addressing semantic ambiguities in existing metrics.

- Presents an efficient framework to empower VLMs by adding a prior tokenizer and instructed vision decoder. This enhances utilization of object-level perceptual elements in feature extraction and prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Releases Reason2Drive, the largest and most diverse language-based driving dataset with reasoning chain annotations.
- Introduces a new evaluation metric for chain-based reasoning in autonomous systems.
- Assesses various VLMs on the dataset, revealing insights on reasoning abilities.
- Develops an efficient approach to integrate perceptual elements into VLMs, boosting localization and reasoning accuracy.
- Benchmark aims to facilitate research on interpretable reasoning for reliable autonomous driving systems.
