# [Reason2Drive: Towards Interpretable and Chain-based Reasoning for   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03661)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a concise yet comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper introduces Reason2Drive, a new benchmark dataset for facilitating the study of interpretable and chain-based reasoning in autonomous driving scenarios. It comprises over 600K video-text pairs extracted from diverse open-source driving datasets. Reason2Drive outperforms existing datasets in terms of scale, source diversity, and inclusion of long reasoning chains. The authors propose dividing the decision-making process in autonomous vehicles into perception, prediction, and reasoning steps, with the dataset containing annotations for each. To address flaws in current evaluation metrics, they also introduce a new aggregated metric tailored to assess reasoning performance. Experiments reveal limitations of existing vision-language models (VLMs) in exploiting visual priors efficiently. To mitigate this, the authors present a novel framework which augments VLMs with a prior tokenizer and instructed vision decoder to bolster perceptual capabilities in the encoder and decoder. Their enhanced model achieves significantly improved performance, demonstrating advanced chain-based reasoning abilities crucial for reliable autonomous systems.
