## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (VLMs) have potential for autonomous driving systems due to advanced reasoning abilities. However, research is hindered by lack of datasets with annotated reasoning chains explaining decision-making processes. 
- Existing datasets oversimplify complex driving processes into basic QA tasks with closed-form answers. They lack multi-step chains covering perception, prediction and reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Reason2Drive, a new benchmark with over 600K video-text pairs for interpretable reasoning in complex driving scenarios.
- Builds on diverse open-source driving datasets like nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE using an extensible annotation schema.
- Includes automated annotations and manual verification to ensure diversity. 
- Distinctly characterizes autonomous driving as sequential steps of perception, prediction and reasoning.
- Proposes a novel evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance, addressing semantic ambiguities in existing metrics.

- Presents an efficient framework to empower VLMs by adding a prior tokenizer and instructed vision decoder. This enhances utilization of object-level perceptual elements in feature extraction and prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Releases Reason2Drive, the largest and most diverse language-based driving dataset with reasoning chain annotations.
- Introduces a new evaluation metric for chain-based reasoning in autonomous systems.
- Assesses various VLMs on the dataset, revealing insights on reasoning abilities.
- Develops an efficient approach to integrate perceptual elements into VLMs, boosting localization and reasoning accuracy.
- Benchmark aims to facilitate research on interpretable reasoning for reliable autonomous driving systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel prior tokenizer to better encode object-level perceptual information. What are the key intuitions and technical details behind the design of this component? How does it improve the model's ability to leverage visual priors compared to directly inputting textual descriptions?

2. The instructed vision decoder is used to generate more accurate perceptual predictions. What modifications were made to the original language model architecture to enable this capability? What objective functions were used to train this component?

3. How were the different components, including the visual encoder, prior tokenizer, language model, and instructed vision decoder effectively integrated into a unified framework? What were some key optimization and implementation strategies? 

4. The model utilizes an aligned cross-modal pre-training stage and a specialized autonomous driving fine-tuning stage. What motivates this two-stage training process? What are the effects of pre-training and how does fine-tuning build upon it?

5. What considerations went into the design of the aggregated evaluation metric for measuring chain-based reasoning capabilities? How does it account for semantic ambiguities compared to metrics like BLEU? What are its limitations?

6. The results demonstrate impressive improvements over strong baselines. What insights do the ablation studies provide into where the gains are coming from? Which components contribute most to the overall performance?

7. The model achieves excellent generalization even when tested on entirely different datasets than what it was trained on. Why does the method generalize well? What specific inductive biases enable this?

8. What assumptions is the model making about the autonomous driving task or reasoning process? When might it fail or produce unreliable outputs? What steps were taken to improve reliability?  

9. How might the model adapt to other embodied AI tasks beyond autonomous driving, such as robot navigation or human-robot interaction? What components are transportable and which may need re-design?

10. The paper focuses on a chain-based reasoning approach. How does this differ from other paradigms like end-to-end or modular pipelines? What are the tradeoffs and why might chain-based reasoning be suitable here?
