# [Large Language Model Alignment: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15025)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question or hypothesis of this paper seems to be: How can we ensure that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and intentions?The paper provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of methods, theories, and proposals for aligning LLMs with human values, also known as LLM alignment. The goal is to bridge the gap between the AI alignment research community and researchers focused on enhancing LLM capabilities, in order to develop LLMs that are not only powerful but also safe, ethical, and trustworthy.The key aspects covered in relation to this research question include:- Defining LLM alignment and situating it within the broader context of AI alignment research- Categorizing LLM alignment techniques into outer alignment (aligning training objectives with human values) and inner alignment (ensuring models robustly optimize intended objectives)- Discussing theoretical concepts like orthogonality thesis and instrumental convergence that underscore the need for LLM alignment- Reviewing empirical outer alignment methods based on reinforcement learning and supervised learning- Introducing proposals for scalable oversight to align superhuman LLMs - Exploring interpretability techniques to enable inspection of model reasoning and transparency- Identifying vulnerabilities of current methods to adversarial attacks- Surveying benchmarks and evaluation methodologies for assessing LLM alignmentSo in summary, the central research question is how to align LLMs with human values and intentions, which encompasses both outer and inner alignment, as well as adjacent topics like interpretability, evaluation, and robustness. The paper aims to provide a holistic overview of this expansive alignment landscape.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contribution appears to be presenting a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and ethics. Specifically, the paper provides:- An overview of why LLM alignment is important, considering both social/ethical risks like bias as well as longer-term risks from advanced AI systems.- A taxonomy of LLM alignment approaches categorized into outer alignment, inner alignment, and interpretability/transparency. - A review of outer alignment methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and scalable oversight.- A discussion of inner alignment concepts like proxy alignment and approximate alignment. - An examination of interpretability techniques for understanding model reasoning.- An analysis of vulnerabilities of aligned models to adversarial attacks.- A survey of evaluation methods and benchmarks for assessing LLM alignment.- A discussion of future research directions for LLM alignment.In summary, the key contribution is providing a structured taxonomy and comprehensive overview of the current landscape of research and techniques for aligning LLMs to be helpful, harmless, and honest. The paper aims to connect the capabilities-focused LLM research community with the broader AI alignment community.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper: This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of methods and techniques for aligning large language models with human values and ethics, categorizing approaches into outer alignment, inner alignment, and mechanistic interpretability, while also discussing model vulnerabilities, evaluation, and promising future research directions.
