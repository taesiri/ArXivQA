# [Synthetic Information towards Maximum Posterior Ratio for deep learning   on Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Class imbalance is a common issue in machine learning where one class has significantly more samples than the other classes. This skews models to be biased towards the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class.
- Most prior work on handling class imbalance focus on traditional ML models. There is limited work exploring this issue in deep learning models which are more data-driven.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new data balancing technique called Synthetic Information towards Maximum Posterior Ratio (SIMPOR) that handles class imbalance for deep learning models. 

- It first identifies the most informative samples using an entropy-based active learning strategy. These informative samples are balanced first since they provide the most information to the model.

- For each minority sample, the technique generates synthetic neighboring samples. It determines the direction to generate these samples by maximizing the posterior ratio to ensure they fall in the minority class with high confidence and avoid crossing class boundaries.  

- The posterior ratio is estimated using non-parametric kernel density estimation to handle complex real-world distributions.

- The remaining non-informative samples are then balanced using a similar strategy.


Main Contributions:

- Explores impact of class imbalance and different mitigation strategies on deep learning models.

- Proposes a new minority oversampling technique SIMPOR to balance classes that utilizes entropy-based sampling, maximum posterior ratio estimation and preserves topology.

- Evaluates SIMPOR against state-of-the-art methods over 41 real-world datasets with varying levels of class imbalance and features. 

- Shows statistically significant improvements in F1 Score and AUC compared to other techniques demonstrating effectiveness of SIMPOR for deep learning on imbalanced data.

The paper proposes a new minority oversampling technique called Synthetic Information towards Maximum Posterior Ratio (SIMPOR) to address the problem of class imbalance in deep learning models. It focuses on generating synthetic data for the minority class in high entropy/informative regions while preserving the data topology.
