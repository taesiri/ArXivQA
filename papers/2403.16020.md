# [PaPr: Training-Free One-Step Patch Pruning with Lightweight ConvNets for   Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As neural networks evolve from convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to advanced vision transformers (ViTs), there is an increasing need to eliminate redundant data for faster processing without compromising accuracy. However, existing methods for pruning redundant image patches are often architecture-specific, require re-training, or incrementally prune patches across layers, limiting their applicability and efficiency. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes PaPr, a novel one-step patch pruning method that leverages lightweight ConvNets to identify key discriminative image regions and eliminates redundant patches early in the network, before passing the reduced representation to larger models. 

Key Ideas:
- Lightweight ConvNets can effectively locate discriminative image regions, despite lower top-1 accuracy, due to their competitive top-k performance. This ability persists irrespective of model size or accuracy.
- A simple class weight recalibration in lightweight ConvNets' FC layers allows generating Precise Patch Significance Maps (PSMs) that consistently highlight key image regions.
- PSMs enable a single-step, early-stage removal of redundant patches before processing by larger models, significantly enhancing efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a training-free, one-step patch pruning framework universally compatible with ViTs, ConvNets and hybrid transformers without architectural constraints.
- Demonstration of lightweight ConvNets' capability for robust patch relevance estimation using proposed weight recalibration and PSM generation techniques. 
- Seamless integration and Pareto-optimal enhancement of existing patch reduction methods by initial pruning with PaPr.
- Extensive experiments highlighting significant computational savings through early patch pruning while maintaining accuracy across various models and tasks.

In summary, the paper makes patch pruning much more practical by eliminating extra training and architectural constraints while streamlining integration of pruning across models. PaPr effectively harnesses lightweight ConvNets to reduce redundancy for heavier models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes PaPr, a training-free one-step patch pruning method that leverages lightweight convolutional neural networks to efficiently identify and remove redundant patches across various vision architectures, achieving significant speedup and flops reduction with minimal accuracy drop.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing PaPr, a novel patch pruning method that can effectively speed up off-the-shelf pre-trained models for inference without needing re-training. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing PaPr, which leverages lightweight convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to efficiently and precisely locate the most discriminative image patches. It generates a patch significance map (PSM) to identify and prune redundant patches in a single step.

2) Demonstrating that PaPr can work with various architectures like vision transformers, ConvNets, and hybrid transformers without modifications or re-training. It can also be easily integrated with existing patch reduction techniques. 

3) Showing through extensive experiments that PaPr outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image classification tasks by a significant margin in terms of accuracy and computational costs. For example, it achieves up to 70% patch reduction in videos with minimal accuracy drop.

4) Highlighting the ability of PaPr to work in video recognition tasks by exploiting spatio-temporal redundancies, leading to around 3.7x speedup with ViT-L-MAE model on Kinetics-400 with only 0.8% accuracy drop.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the training-free PaPr method for efficient patch pruning across various architectures using lightweight ConvNets, without accuracy loss.

The paper introduces a novel training-free patch pruning method called PaPr that leverages lightweight ConvNets to generate patch significance maps, which are then used to eliminate redundant patches in a variety of model architectures like ViTs, ConvNets and hybrid transformers. This allows accelerating pre-trained off-the-shelf models for image and video recognition without retraining.
