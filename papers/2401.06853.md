# [Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Temporal reasoning plays an important role in human perception and is challenging for large language models (LLMs). Existing methods mainly adopt general improvements for LLMs but ignore the nature of temporal reasoning, which is built upon foundations like mathematics, logic, and commonsense knowledge.  

Proposed Solution - TempGraph-LLM Framework:
The paper proposes a new paradigm called TempGraph-LLM with two steps - (1) Translate text into a temporal graph; (2) Perform symbolic reasoning on the graph. 

For step 1, they provide a pipeline for reliable text-to-graph translation, including strategies for entity/relation extraction, temporal info identification and graph verification. They also create a synthetic QA dataset called TempGraph QA with controllable graphs and rule-based QA generation. Pre-training on this dataset benefits LLMs on temporal reasoning tasks. 

For step 2, they use chain of thoughts (CoTs) bootstrapping and special data augmentation strategies to guide LLMs to perform more reliable symbolic reasoning on the temporal graphs. The bootstrapping provides manually verified CoTs examples for LLMs to generate reliable reasoning chains. The data augmentation strategies include disturbances on graphs and inductive transformations to improve reasoning under different contexts.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes TempGraph-LLM, a new two-step paradigm of text-to-graph translation and symbolic reasoning for temporal reasoning.
2) Provides strategies including CoTs bootstrapping and data augmentation to guide LLMs for more reliable symbolic reasoning. 
3) Constructs a synthetic QA dataset TempGraph QA that is controllable and requires minimal supervision. Shows pre-training on this dataset benefits LLMs on temporal reasoning tasks.

Experiments show TempGraph-LLM achieves better performance than existing methods on temporal reasoning datasets. The framework provides interpretability and reliability compared to free text generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes TempGraph-LLM, a new framework for improving language models' capability in temporal reasoning by first translating text into a temporal graph and then performing symbolic reasoning over it.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new paradigm, TempGraph-LLM, for text-based temporal reasoning. This framework first translates the context into a temporal graph, and then performs symbolic reasoning on it. Experiments show that it brings better performance than conventional methods.

2. Designing two approaches including chain of thoughts bootstrapping and data augmentation to guide large language models to utilize symbolic reasoning, which brings better performance than free text reasoning. 

3. Presenting a pipeline to create a synthetic dataset for question answering that requires temporal reasoning. This dataset is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision for context-tempgraph alignment. Experiments show that pre-training on this dataset benefits large language models on other tasks.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the TempGraph-LLM framework, using strategies to enable symbolic reasoning, and creating a synthetic QA dataset to help teach temporal reasoning skills. The methods are shown to improve performance on temporal reasoning tasks.

The paper proposes a new framework called TempGraph-LLM which has two main steps - translating text into a temporal graph representation, and then performing neuro-symbolic reasoning over that graph. Key ideas include using CoTs bootstrapping and data augmentation strategies to improve symbolic reasoning by LLMs, as well as introducing disturbances and inductive transformations during training to make the models more robust. The goal is to improve the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models through this more structured representation and reasoning process.
