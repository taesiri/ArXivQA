## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Sig-Networks, an open-source PyTorch toolkit for longitudinal language modeling using Signature-based Neural Networks. Signature transforms can effectively encode sequential data while handling irregularities. The toolkit allows for flexible adaptation across tasks, incorporating external features, tuning hyperparameters, and benchmarking various sequential baselines. It introduces Signature Window Network Units (SWNU) which model local linguistic progressions, and Seq-Sig-Net which captures long-term dependencies by chaining SWNUs. Variants are also proposed, like replacing the LSTM with multi-head self-attention (SW-Attn). Experiments on three NLP tasks with varying temporal granularity - counselling dialogues, social media threads for stance switch detection, and mood tracking - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The code is available on Github, including sample notebooks. Overall, Sig-Networks provides an accessible way to apply recent advances in encoding time series data to natural language tasks, with strong performance and customizability.
