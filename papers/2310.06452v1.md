# [Understanding the Effects of RLHF on LLM Generalisation and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06452v1)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key findings of the paper:

This paper analyzes how different fine-tuning methods for large language models affect their out-of-distribution generalization and output diversity. The authors evaluate supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and best-of-N sampling on summarization and instruction following tasks. They find that RLHF improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance compared to SFT, with the gaps being larger on more difficult out-of-distribution datasets. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity both for sampling from a single input and across many inputs. The results reveal an inherent tradeoff between generalization and diversity when fine-tuning large language models. While RLHF produces better generalizing models, it comes at the cost of reduced diversity. The authors suggest more research is needed to improve this tradeoff, either by increasing SFT performance or RLHF diversity. Overall the work provides useful guidance on choosing fine-tuning methods based on whether generalization or diversity is more important for a particular application.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the effects of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for fine-tuning large language models, finding that RLHF improves out-of-distribution generalisation but decreases output diversity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the effects of different large language model fine-tuning methods - supervised fine-tuning (SFT), best-of-N sampling (BoN), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - on two key properties: out-of-distribution generalisation and output diversity. Experiments were run using summarisation and instruction following tasks on two base models. The results show that RLHF improves generalisation, particularly for larger distribution shifts between train and test data, but significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT. This reveals an inherent tension between generalisation and diversity in current LLM fine-tuning techniques. The authors suggest that more research is needed to improve this tradeoff, either by increasing SFT generalisation or RLHF diversity. They also emphasise the need for evaluations beyond aggregate metrics, and provide guidance on fine-tuning method choice based on use case requirements around generalisation and diversity.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT), best-of-N sampling (BoN) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for fine-tuning large language models on summarization and instruction following tasks. It finds that RLHF improves out-of-distribution generalization over SFT but significantly reduces output diversity, revealing a tradeoff between generalization and diversity in current LLM fine-tuning methods.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how does each stage of the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipeline for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) affect out-of-distribution generalization and output diversity?

The key hypothesis is that RLHF improves generalization but reduces output diversity compared to supervised fine-tuning. The authors evaluate this by analyzing the effects of supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling, and RLHF on generalization and diversity across two tasks and two base models.

In summary, the main research question is understanding the tradeoffs between generalization and diversity when using different LLM fine-tuning techniques like RLHF and SFT. The central hypothesis is that RLHF improves generalization but harms diversity compared to SFT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis comparing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and best-of-N sampling (BoN) for fine-tuning large language models. The key findings are:

- RLHF improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance compared to SFT, but substantially reduces output diversity. This reveals a tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.

- BoN outperforms RLHF in terms of generalisation, showing the value of using a reward model to filter samples at test time. However, BoN has a higher inference cost.

- As model size increases, the generalisation gap decreases for RLHF but not for SFT. This helps explain why RLHF is useful when scaling up models. 

- RLHF generalises better relative to SFT for larger distribution shifts between training and testing.

Overall, the paper provides guidance on which fine-tuning method to use depending on the application, and shows that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity in current LLM fine-tuning techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research on evaluating RLHF for fine-tuning large language models:

- This paper provides one of the most comprehensive analyses of how RLHF affects model performance compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). It evaluates effects on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, as well as output diversity. Most prior work focuses on only one or two of these aspects.

- The paper evaluates RLHF in two different tasks - summarization and instruction following. Looking at multiple tasks makes the results more robust. Much prior work looks at only a single task. 

- The paper examines model performance at different stages of the RLHF pipeline - after SFT, after reward model training, and after RL fine-tuning. This provides more detailed insights compared to just evaluating the end model.

- The paper uses multiple metrics to evaluate both generalization and diversity. For example, it uses distinct n-grams, sentence embeddings, and NLI for evaluating diversity. Many papers rely on just one or two metrics. Using multiple metrics provides a more well-rounded evaluation.

- The paper validates the automated metrics against human judgments. Showing correlation with human preferences makes the results more meaningful.

- The paper uses strong baseline models - LLama and OPT. Many RLHF papers use smaller or older models as baselines.

- The paper examines different model sizes, showing how trends change with scale. Much prior work looks at only one model scale.

In summary, this paper provides one of the most thorough evaluations of RLHF for finetuning LLMs to date by looking at multiple tasks, using multiple metrics, validating against human judgments, comparing to strong baselines, and examining different model scales. The analysis of both generalization and diversity is more comprehensive than prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the content and discussion in the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Investigate why RLHF reduces output diversity so much, and whether the lost diversity can be recovered without sacrificing performance. The authors suggest taking inspiration from deep RL literature that specifically injects diversity into the RL optimization process.

- Experimentally validate the hypotheses for why RLHF generalizes better than SFT. This is important for building understanding of how these methods work and when they should be used. 

- Evaluate other methods beyond just SFT and RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs, such as Chain of Thought, COOP CARP, etc. Understanding their effects on generalization and diversity would be beneficial.

- Develop methods that improve the generalization-diversity tradeoff beyond what current techniques can achieve. The authors believe there may be a fundamental pareto frontier here, but current methods are not achieving the optimal tradeoff.

- Do human evaluations on the effects of RLHF on model outputs, beyond just automatic metrics.

- Evaluate the effects of RLHF on generalisation and diversity across more combinations of base models and tasks.

In summary, the main suggestions are to better understand the core reasons behind the generalization-diversity tradeoff, develop new methods to improve upon it, and perform more rigorous human and automatic evaluation across diverse settings.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and best-of-N (BoN) sampling. How do you think adding unlabeled data during the supervised pretraining phase would affect the relative performance of these different fine-tuning methods? Would it help SFT more compared to RLHF and BoN?

2. The authors find that RLHF improves out-of-distribution generalization compared to SFT, but harms diversity. Do you think this tradeoff is fundamental, or could new algorithms be developed that achieve both good generalization and diversity? What ideas do you have for how to improve generalization without hurting diversity?

3. For the summarization experiments, the authors use a proxy reward model trained on the full dataset without splitting. How do you think training separate reward models for each train/test split would affect the results? Would it change conclusions about generalization gaps?

4. The authors evaluate diversity using distinct n-grams, sentence embeddings, and NLI. Can you think of other insightful semantic, syntactic or logical diversity metrics that could reveal different trends? How would you expect stylistic metrics like those in Stylene to compare? 

5. The paper shows RLHF may generalize better than SFT for large distribution shifts. Do you think this conclusion would hold for other kinds of distribution shifts like domain adaptation? How could the experimental protocol be extended to more rigorously test generalization?

6. The authors use a fixed KL penalty coefficient in the RLHF reward. How do you think adaptively changing this coefficient during training would affect the diversity/generalization tradeoff? What algorithm could be used to set the penalty adaptively?

7. For the BoN experiments, all samples are drawn independently. How do you think using correlated or conditional sampling would affect the BoN results? Would it improve generalization or diversity?

8. The authors use PPO for RLHF training. How do you think on-policy algorithms like A2C would compare to off-policy methods like DQN? What are the potential benefits and downsides?

9. The paper focuses on decoding-only transformer LMs. How do you think using an encoder-decoder model would affect the results? Would the encoder help the diversity of RLHF models?

10. The authors use a simple linear reward model. Do you think using more powerful neural network reward models would change the conclusions? How might it affect what the model learns during RLHF?
