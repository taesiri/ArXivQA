# [Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Sequential Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow a sequence of instructions in a single query, often ignoring or misinterpreting part of it. This impairs their performance on complex tasks requiring multiple intermediate steps, like multilingual, multimodal, and reasoning tasks.

- Instruction tuning datasets used to train LLMs lack examples with sequential instructions spanning multiple sub-tasks. As a result, even state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit limited proficiency on queries requiring sequential task execution.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose sequential instruction tuning (SIT), a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy to equip LLMs with the ability to execute multiple sequential instructions. 

- SIT extends instruction tuning data by concatenating more tasks to the input instructions and modifying the output accordingly. Both dummy tasks like repetition and meaningful tasks like translation are explored as intermediate steps.

- LLMs are fine-tuned on instruction tuning datasets augmented with SIT to handle sequential instructions better.

Main Contributions:
- Unveiled inability of current LLMs to follow long, complex sequential instructions through experiments.

- Proposed SIT, a novel sequential instruction tuning paradigm to mitigate this limitation via automatic data augmentation with intermediate tasks.

- Demonstrated SIT boosts performance across commonsense reasoning, multilingual QA, and VQA tasks. Models also follow instructions more faithfully.

- Analyzed how SIT generalizes to unseen tasks, different templates, varying prompt lengths and number of steps.

- Opened new research directions for enhancing complex sequential instruction following in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes sequential instruction tuning, a method to automatically augment instruction tuning datasets by inserting intermediate tasks, in order to improve large language models' ability to follow instructions requiring sequential multi-step execution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing sequential instruction tuning (SIT), a simple yet effective strategy to automatically augment instruction tuning data and equip large language models with the ability to execute multiple sequential instructions. Specifically, the paper:

1) Unveils that current large language models struggle to follow long, complex sequential instructions, even state-of-the-art open-source models like LLaMA-70B and Mixtral-8x7B.

2) Proposes to extend input instructions by concatenating them with more tasks (either dummy or meaningful) and modifying the output accordingly. This sequential augmentation is motivated by the fact that meaningful intermediate tasks can form an intuitive chain-of-thought process.

3) Shows that models fine-tuned with SIT consistently outperform vanilla instruction-tuned baselines in downstream tasks involving reasoning, multilingual, and multimodal abilities, with gains of up to +17% on XQuAD.

4) Demonstrates the versatility of SIT via analyses on unseen tasks, different prompt templates, varying numbers of tasks, and input lengths.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and analyzing sequential instruction tuning to enhance both the instruction-following behavior and downstream performance of large language models.

Keywords: Large Language Models, Instruction Tuning, Sequential Instructions, Intermediate Tasks, Multitask Learning, Reasoning, Multilingual, Multimodal

The paper proposes a method called "sequential instruction tuning" (SIT) to improve the ability of large language models to follow instructions that require completing multiple intermediate tasks before producing a final output. The key ideas include:

- Current LLMs struggle with complex, multi-step instructions in a single query.
- SIT augments instruction tuning data by chaining original instructions with intermediate tasks. 
- Both dummy tasks (e.g. repeat input) and meaningful tasks (e.g. translate input) are explored as intermediate steps.
- SIT improves performance on reasoning, multilingual, and multimodal downstream tasks.
- Analyses show SIT models generalize better to unseen tasks and instructions.

In summary, the paper focuses on enhancing LLMs to handle instructions spanning multiple sub-tasks, through a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy during instruction tuning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the sequential instruction tuning method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper shows that current LLMs struggle with following long, complex sequential instructions. What are some potential reasons why sequential instructions are lacking in the pre-training data and datasets used for instruction tuning? 

2. The paper proposes augmenting instruction tuning datasets by automatically interleaving intermediate tasks. What are some ways this augmentation strategy could be expanded, for example by incorporating a wider variety of intermediate tasks?

3. The results show improved performance on downstream tasks after sequential instruction tuning. To what extent could this improvement be attributed to the model learning better instruction following abilities versus simply having increased parameters or computation?

4. The method relies on pre-defining meaningful intermediate tasks. How could the automatic construction or discovery of useful intermediate tasks be approached to make sequential instruction tuning more flexible?

5. The paper analyzes how robust sequential instruction tuning is to variations like different prompts and number of tasks. What other dimensions of robustness would be worth analyzing?

6. The results show bigger gains on more distant language pairs in the multilingual experiments. Why might sequential instruction tuning be especially useful for lower-resource languages compared to higher-resource ones?  

7. What kinds ofprompts or intermediate tasks would be useful for seqential instruction tuning in modalities beyond text and images, such as video, audio, tabular data, etc.?

8. How suitable would sequential instruction tuning be for long-horizon sequential decision making tasks like reinforcement learning? What adjustments might be needed?

9. The method relies on modifying existing instruction tuning datasets. What are some ideas for collecting human demonstrations directly in a sequential instruction format?

10. What types of model architectures could complement or improve upon sequential instruction tuning, like retrieve-and-refine approaches that explicitly separate the intermediate and final tasks?
