# [Lasagna: Layered Score Distillation for Disentangled Object Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Manual editing tools for image relighting are difficult to master and tedious. While recent diffusion-based text-guided image editing methods show promise, they struggle with control over lighting/shading due to lacking geometry-based knowledge in their pre-training. Existing supervised relighting methods require estimating object intrinsics so they lack generalization.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Lasagna, a method for disentangled text-guided object relighting. It has two key components:

1. It learns to extract a geometry prior from a diffusion model using score distillation sampling, inspired by DreamFusion. This allows introducing custom sampling constraints. 

2. It represents the relighting edit using separate layers - a shading and a lighting layer that only adjust image luminosity. This disentangles lighting from other edits and is inspired by tools like Photoshop.

To train Lasagna, the paper collects ReLiT - a large-scale synthetic dataset with objects rendered under varying lighting. This introduces the lighting prior into the diffusion model.

Main Contributions:

- Lasagna - a method for disentangled text-guided object relighting using score distillation sampling and layered image composition

- ReLiT dataset - a novel large-scale synthetic dataset for learning lighting priors, containing 13,975 3D objects rendered with different light sources

- Experiments showing Lasagna can relight real images and even digital art while preserving content better than state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods. A human study shows over 91% preference for Lasagna.

- Proof-of-concept for using the proposed approach for text-guided sketch colorization, showing the versatility of the method.

In summary, the main idea is to disentangle lighting from other aspects of an image to allow controlled and realistic relighting guided just by text prompts. This is achieved via a learned geometry prior and restricted layered editing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Lasagna, a method that enables realistic and controllable text-guided relighting of images by learning to extract a lighting prior from a diffusion model finetuned on synthetic data and representing the edit as luminosity adjustment layers that are composed with the input image.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. \MethodName, a method for text-guided relighting of images that learns to extract a geometry prior from a diffusion model using score distillation sampling. This allows disentangled control over lighting while preserving other aspects of the image.

2. A layered image editing framework where the edit is represented as a separate layer that is composed with the input image. This restricts changes to certain aspects like luminosity and prevents unwanted changes.

3. \DataName, a large-scale synthetic dataset for relighting containing over 14,000 3D object assets rendered with varying lighting. This is used to train a diffusion model to introduce a lighting prior.

So in summary, the main contributions are a method, framework, and dataset for controlled and realistic text-guided relighting of images using diffusion models and score distillation sampling. The key ideas are learning a disentangled lighting prior and representing the edit using layered image composition.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset called \DataName for training object relighting models. What are some key properties and statistics of this dataset? How does it compare in diversity and size to other existing datasets for this task?

2. The core of the proposed method is a technique called "layered score distillation sampling". Can you explain in detail how this technique works and what advantages it provides over directly predicting the relit image? 

3. The method decomposes relighting into separate editing layers for shading and lighting adjustments. What is the motivation behind this layered formulation? How does it help achieve disentangled and controlled relighting edits?

4. Score distillation sampling requires optimizing a generator network to match the score predictions from a frozen diffusion model. What modifications were made to the typical SDS training process to enable conditional image relighting?

5. The authors use a ControlNet adaptor conditioned on text prompts to introduce lighting direction conditioning into the diffusion model. How is this adaptor trained? What benefits does it provide over using an off-the-shelf model?

6. The method is applied to both natural photographs and digital artwork. How does the layered formulation and distillation process contribute to cross-domain generalization? Are there any differences in how the model handles these two types of images?

7. What quantitative evaluation protocols and metrics were used to validate performance? What are the limitations of pixel-based metrics for evaluating relighting quality?

8. Can you analyze and interpret the human evaluation results comparing the proposed method against baselines? Are there any interesting takeaways in terms of where existing editing techniques still struggle?  

9. The paper demonstrates extending this approach to the task of sketch colorization using alpha blending layers. In what ways could the layered SDS concept be applied or adapted to other image editing tasks beyond lighting adjustment?

10. What do you see as the main limitations of the current method? How might the approach be expanded and improved in future work?
