# [Lasagna: Layered Score Distillation for Disentangled Object Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Manual editing tools for image relighting are difficult to master and tedious. While recent diffusion-based text-guided image editing methods show promise, they struggle with control over lighting/shading due to lacking geometry-based knowledge in their pre-training. Existing supervised relighting methods require estimating object intrinsics so they lack generalization.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Lasagna, a method for disentangled text-guided object relighting. It has two key components:

1. It learns to extract a geometry prior from a diffusion model using score distillation sampling, inspired by DreamFusion. This allows introducing custom sampling constraints. 

2. It represents the relighting edit using separate layers - a shading and a lighting layer that only adjust image luminosity. This disentangles lighting from other edits and is inspired by tools like Photoshop.

To train Lasagna, the paper collects ReLiT - a large-scale synthetic dataset with objects rendered under varying lighting. This introduces the lighting prior into the diffusion model.

Main Contributions:

- Lasagna - a method for disentangled text-guided object relighting using score distillation sampling and layered image composition

- ReLiT dataset - a novel large-scale synthetic dataset for learning lighting priors, containing 13,975 3D objects rendered with different light sources

- Experiments showing Lasagna can relight real images and even digital art while preserving content better than state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods. A human study shows over 91% preference for Lasagna.

- Proof-of-concept for using the proposed approach for text-guided sketch colorization, showing the versatility of the method.

In summary, the main idea is to disentangle lighting from other aspects of an image to allow controlled and realistic relighting guided just by text prompts. This is achieved via a learned geometry prior and restricted layered editing.
