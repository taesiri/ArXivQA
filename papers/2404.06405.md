# [Wu's Method can Boost Symbolic AI to Rival Silver Medalists and   AlphaGeometry to Outperform Gold Medalists at IMO Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automated theorem proving for geometry problems is considered an important AI milestone. The recent AlphaGeometry system solved 25/30 challenging International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) geometry problems, while prior methods like Wu's method reportedly solved only 10.

Method and Findings:  
- The authors reevaluated Wu's method on the IMO-AG-30 benchmark. Surprisingly, Wu's method alone solves 15 problems, including 2 that AlphaGeometry failed to solve.

- By combining Wu's method with classic synthetic proof methods like deductive databases and angle/ratio chasing (DD+AR), they achieve 21/30 problems solved - rivaling the performance of an IMO silver medalist.  

- By further combining Wu's method with AlphaGeometry, they achieve 27/30 problems solved, outperforming even IMO gold medalists for the first time.

Main Contributions:
- Established a new fully symbolic baseline (Wu+DD+AR) that rivals human IMO silver medalists, solving the open problem of surpassing average human contestants.

- Show that algebraic methods like Wu's complement recent synthetic methods, jointly achieving new state-of-the-art on the IMO-AG-30 benchmark.

- Demonstrate that combined neural-symbolic systems can now surpass even exceptional humans (IMO gold medalists) on math reasoning.

In summary, the paper highlights the surprising effectiveness of classic algebraic methods on geometry theorem proving, and shows that combining neural and symbolic AI techniques can achieve unprecedented performance on this AI grand challenge.
