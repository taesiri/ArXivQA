# [Bring Your Own Data! Self-Supervised Evaluation for Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13651)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main goal of this work is to introduce a new framework for self-supervised evaluation of large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

- Propose metrics based on analyzing model invariance/sensitivity to perturbations of the input text, rather than relying on external labels or datasets. 

- Demonstrate this framework on several case studies like measuring knowledge via negations, toxicity, context dependence, word order sensitivity, etc.

- Show that when comparable labeled benchmarks exist, the proposed self-supervised metrics correlate well, validating their usefulness.

- Present this as a complementary technique to standard supervised evaluation that has advantages like being dataset-agnostic.

So in summary, the main research contribution is introducing and demonstrating a methodology for self-supervised evaluation of LLMs using sensitivity metrics, with the goal of providing more comprehensive and efficient ways to understand model strengths and weaknesses. The key hypothesis seems to be that analyzing invariances can provide meaningful insights into model behavior without human annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework for self-supervised evaluation of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. The key ideas are:

- Self-supervised evaluation does not rely on human labels or curated datasets. Instead, it applies perturbations to naturally occurring text and measures how model outputs change.

- Several case studies are presented demonstrating self-supervised evaluation strategies for properties like knowledge, toxicity, context dependence, etc.

- The proposed metrics show promising correlation with human benchmarks when available. However, they can be applied more broadly without needing specialized labeled data.

- This provides a complementary lens to conventional supervised evaluation, and could enable online monitoring of models after deployment.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the self-supervised evaluation paradigm and demonstrating its viability through proposed techniques to assess model capabilities in areas like knowledge, toxicity, context sensitivity without human labels. The authors argue this can complement benchmark evaluations and enable continuous monitoring.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper introduces a new framework for self-supervised evaluation of language models, which complements existing approaches that rely on human-labeled datasets. Other recent work has also aimed to move beyond limited labeled datasets, but has focused more on dynbench-style dynamically generated datasets or adversarial/counterfactual evaluation. The idea of purely unsupervised evaluation through invariance metrics is novel.

- The paper demonstrates the self-supervised evaluation approach on several important capabilities like knowledge, toxicity, context dependence, etc. Each of these capabilities has been the subject of prior benchmark datasets, but the unsupervised metrics proposed here correlate well while requiring no human annotation effort.

- In terms of knowledge evaluation, this paper's use of perplexity change from negations is simple but effective. Other work has relied more on specialized knowledge probing datasets which can be limited in coverage. For toxicity, the focus on model stoicism is also novel compared to past reliance on toxicity classifiers.

- The self-supervised metrics are dataset-agnostic and could complement existing standardized benchmarks by providing continuous evaluation on unlabeled corpora at a larger scale and in more diverse domains. They could also enable live testing during model deployment.

- The proposed approach is model-based and does not require training auxiliary classifiers or other components beyond the language model itself. This contrasts with some past work like toxicity classification through Perspective API.

- Limitations of the current work include the limited scope of transformations tested so far and the focus on simpler perplexity metrics rather than behavior in generated text. But it provides a solid basis for extension to other self-supervised metrics.

In summary, the self-supervised evaluation paradigm introduced in this paper is novel and represents a promising research direction that can expand the toolbox for language model testing. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach and highlight its differences from prior benchmark-centric evaluation methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Exploring how model entropy interacts with and impacts sensitivity scores. The authors note that model entropy likely affects sensitivity metrics, but they did not fully investigate this relationship in the current work.

- Analyzing the interactions between memorization behaviors in pre-training and sensitivity metrics. The authors mention that understanding these interactions could lead to more robust and informative sensitivity metrics.

- Applying self-supervised evaluation to novel texts, like news articles, to eliminate the possibility of memorization effects.

- Developing additional self-supervised metrics beyond the ones explored in this work, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of model capabilities and limitations.

- Validating the approach on more diverse datasets beyond Wikipedia, including domain-specific corpora relevant to real-world applications.

- Considering different constructions or transformations beyond the simple ones used in this work, such as leveraging the models themselves to generate counterfactual inputs.

- Incorporating additional output analysis beyond perplexity and next-token predictions, like attention distributions.

- Extending the toxicity analysis to capture more nuanced forms of harmful content.

- Exploring other tokenization errors beyond character splits to better understand robustness.

So in summary, the authors propose continuing to develop new self-supervised metrics, analyzing the interactions of these metrics with factors like entropy and memorization, applying the approach to novel datasets, using more sophisticated transformations, and incorporating additional output analysis techniques. The overall goal is to complement traditional supervised evaluation with self-supervised techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework for self-supervised evaluation of large language models (LLMs) that does not rely on labeled datasets or human annotations. Instead of measuring accuracy on a benchmark, the authors propose analyzing model sensitivity or invariance to transformations applied to the input text. They demonstrate this approach with case studies measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, long-range context dependence, and sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. Negations are introduced to sentences to evaluate knowledge representation. Profanity is appended to prompts to measure toxicity through model outputs. Long-range context dependence is tested by replacing sentences in a passage and comparing distributions over a target sentence. Word order sensitivity is measured by swapping words in sentences. Tokenization robustness is evaluated by manipulating spacing. Where possible, these self-supervised metrics are shown to correlate with similar human-supervised evaluations. The self-supervised paradigm is presented as complementary to labeled data, providing model insights through simple interventions on the input. The framework allows evaluating capabilities directly on datasets collected in the wild or during live model deployment without additional labeling.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework for self-supervised evaluation of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Rather than relying on benchmark datasets with human labels, the proposed method tests LLMs by applying simple perturbations to text and measuring changes in model output. 

Several case studies demonstrate the approach: evaluating closed-book knowledge via negations, toxicity through profanity injections, long-range context dependence by swapping sentences, and sensitivity to word order and tokenization. Experiments find strong correlation between the self-supervised evaluations and human-labeled benchmarks for knowledge and context dependence. The self-supervised evaluations provide meaningful insights into model capabilities and complement standard evaluation based on labeled data. The approach removes the need for new labeled data when testing models, enabling evaluation on raw text from any domain. Overall, the work lays groundwork for model analysis through input transformations and output invariances in a dataset-agnostic fashion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a framework for self-supervised evaluation of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Rather than relying on human-curated datasets with ground truth labels, the proposed approach constructs text pairs where one is an original passage and the other is a perturbed version. For example, the authors negate factual statements, append profane phrases, swap the word order, or induce tokenization errors. These text pairs are fed into the LLM, and the output probabilities are compared between the original and perturbed versions using metrics like perplexity or Jensen-Shannon divergence. The differences in output are aggregated over many samples to produce sensitivity scores that aim to measure capabilities like knowledge, toxicity, word order understanding, and robustness. The authors demonstrate the approach on Wikipedia text for properties including closed-book knowledge, toxicity, long-range context, and tokenization sensitivity. The sensitivity scores correlate well with human-supervised metrics in the knowledge and context dependence experiments where comparisons are possible. The overall framework provides a complementary lens for evaluating LLMs in a self-supervised, dataset-agnostic manner without additional labeling effort.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper is proposing a framework for self-supervised evaluation of large language models (LLMs) as a complement to current evaluation methods that rely on labeled datasets. The key ideas are:

- Current LLM evaluations depend on human-curated datasets, which can be expensive to create, limited in scope/distribution, and potentially contaminated by overlap with training data. 

- Self-supervised evaluation analyzes model behavior by testing invariance or sensitivity to transformations of the input text, without needing labels.

- This allows evaluating models more broadly, directly on real application data or even during live deployment. 

- The paper demonstrates this on several tasks: measuring knowledge via negations, toxicity, long-range context, word order sensitivity, and robustness to tokenization errors.

- When benchmark comparisons are available, they find self-supervised metrics correlate well with human-supervised ones.

So in summary, the paper is proposing self-supervised evaluation as a more efficient, scalable way to analyze model behaviors beyond just accuracy, that complements existing labeled dataset approaches. The end goal is gaining a more comprehensive understanding of LLM strengths and weaknesses.
