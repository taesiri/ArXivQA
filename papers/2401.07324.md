# [Small LLMs Are Weak Tool Learners: A Multi-LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07324)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limited capabilities when used as standalone models for complex tasks like tool use which require planning, tool selection/invocation, and result summarization. 
- Using a single LLM for all capabilities has limitations, especially for smaller open-source LLMs. 
- Retraining the entire LLM is needed when tools change.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a multi-LLM framework called Î±-UMi with specialized roles - planner, caller, summarizer.
- Planner does planning and decides next component.
- Caller interacts with tools/APIs.
- Summarizer summarizes execution to generate final answer.
- Two-stage progressive fine-tuning strategy called GLPFT to train the LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate small LLMs are weak tool learners; multi-LLM framework outperforms single LLM.
- Propose two-stage GLPFT strategy to effectively train multi-LLM framework.
- Thorough analysis showing reasons for superior performance - specialized roles, prompt design, overcoming limitations of single LLM.
- Show smaller LLMs can be used in framework to develop capabilities and achieve competitive performance.
- Modular framework allows updating individual components.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel multi-LLM framework and training strategy that outperforms the single LLM approach for tool use tasks. Key ideas are decomposing capabilities across specialized LLMs and a two-stage fine-tuning approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-LLM framework called $\alpha$-UMi that decomposes the complex capabilities needed for tool use into specialized roles handled by separate small language models, enabling enhanced performance compared to using a single LLM.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It demonstrates that small LLMs are weak tool learners and introduces $\alpha$-UMi, a multi-LLM framework for building LLM agents, that outperforms the existing single-LLM approach in tool use and program-aided mathematical reasoning. 

2. It proposes a two-stage fine-tuning strategy called global-to-local progressive fine-tuning (GLPFT), which has proven essential for the success of the $\alpha$-UMi framework.

3. It performs a thorough analysis, delving into data-scaling laws and investigating the underlying reasons behind the superior performance of the $\alpha$-UMi framework over single-LLM agents.

In summary, the key innovation is the multi-LLM $\alpha$-UMi framework and the associated GLPFT training strategy, which enables smaller LLMs to surpass the capabilities of larger single-LLM agents for tool learning tasks.

The paper introduces a multi-LLM framework called $\alpha$-UMi for building LLM agents focused on tool use and mathematical reasoning. It decomposes the capabilities required for tool learning into separate roles handled by different LLMs - a planner, caller, and summarizer. A two-stage global-to-local progressive fine-tuning strategy is proposed to train this framework. Experiments on benchmarks like ToolBench, ToolAlpaca, MATH, and GSM8K demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over single LLM methods.
