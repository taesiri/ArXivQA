## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on controllable text generation:

- This paper provides a broad and comprehensive overview of the field of controllable text generation using pre-trained language models. It covers the key concepts, tasks, approaches, and evaluation methods in a systematic way. Many other survey papers focus only on a specific sub-area, such as controllable story generation or debiasing text generation. The scope of this paper is wider, making it a good reference for researchers new to the field.

- The paper categorizes the main approaches into fine-tuning methods, retraining/refactoring methods, and post-processing methods. This provides a clear framework for understanding the variety of techniques used for controllable text generation. Other surveys have used different taxonomies, such as dividing methods into supervised and unsupervised categories. 

- The paper puts a strong emphasis on reviewing the latest work, with most references from the past 3-4 years. This makes it very current, capturing the rapid recent progress enabled by large pre-trained language models like GPT-3. Some other survey papers cover a longer timescale and more foundational work.

- The authors provide thoughtful analysis of the challenges facing controllable text generation research, and suggest promising future directions. Other survey papers tend to focus more on summarizing past work rather than looking ahead. 

- Compared to review articles published in top-tier journals, this paper has a more tutorial style intended to introduce the area to readers less familiar with the field. The tradeoff is less technical depth in the description of some methods.

In summary, this paper provides a broad, up-to-date overview of controllable text generation that can serve as a helpful reference for researchers and students looking to learn about recent advances in this dynamic field. Its scope and forward-looking perspective complement other surveys with different focuses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

1. Prompt-based learning: The authors suggest exploring the use of prompt-based methods like instruction tuning and in-context learning to improve controllable text generation, as prompts can help adapt PLMs to new scenarios with little labeled data. 

2. Fine-grained decoding control: Developing more fine-grained methods to control text generation during decoding, such as through co-training the generator and discriminator. This can improve control over attributes like topics and emotions.

3. Integration with classic generative models and linguistic knowledge: Combining principles from generative models like GANs and VAEs with linguistic knowledge to help PLMs better model global text structure and long-term coherence for controllable generation.

4. Incorporating external knowledge: Enhancing PLMs with external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs and retrieved Web information to improve reasoning ability and domain knowledge for controllable generation.

5. Novel evaluation methods: Developing new automated methods of evaluating controllable text generation quality and attribute consistency that align well with human judgments.

6. New CTG tasks: Defining new datasets and benchmarks tailored to controllable text generation that align with goals like avoiding harmful content.

In summary, the main suggestions are around adapting prompts, decoding control, incorporating linguistic knowledge and external information, improving evaluation, and developing new tasks - to advance controllable text generation with PLMs.

The paper presents a comprehensive review of the emerging research area of controllable text generation using large-scale pre-trained language models.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive landscape of the emerging field of controllable text generation using pre-trained language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for controllable text generation based on pre-trained language models (PLMs). The key idea is to leverage reinforcement learning to fine-tune the PLM by combining it with human feedback signals. Specifically, the method first initializes a policy π with a PLM ρ (e.g. GPT-2). It then defines a reward function R(x,y) based on a learned human preference model r(x,y) and a KL divergence term to keep π close to ρ. The policy π is optimized using this reward signal through a reinforcement learning algorithm to steer the PLM towards generating text that better aligns with human preferences. By incorporating real-time human feedback into the loop, the method provides an effective way to improve controllability of PLMs for text generation while maintaining fluency. The human preference model r(x,y) is trained on samples of human pairwise comparisons between model generations. Overall, this reinforcement learning framework with learned human preferences allows guiding the PLM to produce more controllable generations.
