## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How to achieve controllable text generation using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs)?The key points are:- Controllable text generation (CTG) is an important capability for advanced natural language generation systems, allowing them to produce text that meets specific constraints and requirements. - Recently, PLMs like BERT, GPT-2/3, etc. have become the dominant paradigm in NLP. However, their black-box nature makes controllability a challenge. - This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the latest techniques for achieving controllable text generation using PLMs. - It reviews the main tasks, approaches, and evaluation methods for CTG with PLMs. The approaches are categorized into fine-tuning, retraining/refactoring, and post-processing.- Challenges like catastrophic forgetting, coarse decoding control, lack of global text modeling, etc. are discussed. - Promising future directions like prompt-based learning, integrating linguistic knowledge, novel evaluation metrics, etc. are highlighted.In summary, the central research question is how to enable controllable text generation using the powerful yet uninterpretable PLMs, through various techniques like fine-tuning, prompt design, decoding control, etc. The paper aims to provide a holistic landscape of this emerging research area.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in controllable text generation using pre-trained language models, covering common tasks, main approaches, and evaluation methodologies, along with a discussion of key challenges and promising future research directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on controllable text generation:- This paper provides a broad and comprehensive overview of the field of controllable text generation using pre-trained language models. It covers the key concepts, tasks, approaches, and evaluation methods in a systematic way. Many other survey papers focus only on a specific sub-area, such as controllable story generation or debiasing text generation. The scope of this paper is wider, making it a good reference for researchers new to the field.- The paper categorizes the main approaches into fine-tuning methods, retraining/refactoring methods, and post-processing methods. This provides a clear framework for understanding the variety of techniques used for controllable text generation. Other surveys have used different taxonomies, such as dividing methods into supervised and unsupervised categories. - The paper puts a strong emphasis on reviewing the latest work, with most references from the past 3-4 years. This makes it very current, capturing the rapid recent progress enabled by large pre-trained language models like GPT-3. Some other survey papers cover a longer timescale and more foundational work.- The authors provide thoughtful analysis of the challenges facing controllable text generation research, and suggest promising future directions. Other survey papers tend to focus more on summarizing past work rather than looking ahead. - Compared to review articles published in top-tier journals, this paper has a more tutorial style intended to introduce the area to readers less familiar with the field. The tradeoff is less technical depth in the description of some methods.In summary, this paper provides a broad, up-to-date overview of controllable text generation that can serve as a helpful reference for researchers and students looking to learn about recent advances in this dynamic field. Its scope and forward-looking perspective complement other surveys with different focuses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions the authors suggest are:1. Prompt-based learning: The authors suggest exploring the use of prompt-based methods like instruction tuning and in-context learning to improve controllable text generation, as prompts can help adapt PLMs to new scenarios with little labeled data. 2. Fine-grained decoding control: Developing more fine-grained methods to control text generation during decoding, such as through co-training the generator and discriminator. This can improve control over attributes like topics and emotions.3. Integration with classic generative models and linguistic knowledge: Combining principles from generative models like GANs and VAEs with linguistic knowledge to help PLMs better model global text structure and long-term coherence for controllable generation.4. Incorporating external knowledge: Enhancing PLMs with external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs and retrieved Web information to improve reasoning ability and domain knowledge for controllable generation.5. Novel evaluation methods: Developing new automated methods of evaluating controllable text generation quality and attribute consistency that align well with human judgments.6. New CTG tasks: Defining new datasets and benchmarks tailored to controllable text generation that align with goals like avoiding harmful content.In summary, the main suggestions are around adapting prompts, decoding control, incorporating linguistic knowledge and external information, improving evaluation, and developing new tasks - to advance controllable text generation with PLMs.
