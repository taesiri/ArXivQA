# [Tightly-Coupled LiDAR-IMU-Wheel Odometry with Online Calibration of a   Kinematic Model for Skid-Steering Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02515)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of accurate and robust odometry estimation for mobile robots, especially in environments where LiDAR point clouds can degenerate (e.g. tunnels, corridors). While LiDAR and LiDAR-IMU odometry methods achieve high accuracy in feature-rich environments, they fail when point clouds degenerate over longer periods. Wheel odometry is more reliable in such cases but is challenging to model accurately for skid-steering robots due to factors like wheel slippage. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a tightly-coupled LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry approach with online calibration of the wheel kinematics. This formulates odometry estimation as a factor graph optimization problem. A novel "full linear wheel odometry factor" is introduced which serves both as a motion constraint and enables online calibration of the wheel kinematics to handle model errors. The covariance/uncertainty of this factor is also estimated online based on terrain roughness. Constant and fixation factors further constrain kinematic parameters during degeneracy.

Main Contributions:
1) Tight fusion of LiDAR, IMU and wheel encoders with online calibration to handle both point cloud degeneracy and skid-steer kinematics errors.
2) Full linear wheel odometry factor for joint optimization of trajectory and kinematics, with online uncertainty estimation.  
3) Demonstrated high accuracy in indoor, outdoor and changing terrain experiments. Robust even with >50% degenerated point clouds.
4) Open-sourced implementation of full linear wheel odometry factor.

In summary, the paper presents a robust tightly-coupled LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry approach that can operate accurately even when LiDAR data degenerates over longer sequences, through online calibration and uncertainty estimation. The full linear wheel factor enables trajectories and kinematics to be optimized jointly.
