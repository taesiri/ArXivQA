## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SiCP, a unified perception framework for connected and automated vehicles that supports both individual and cooperative perception within a single model. SiCP introduces a lightweight Dual-Perception Network (DP-Net) module that manages local features for individual perception and fuses features from neighbors for cooperative perception. The core of DP-Net is a complementary feature fusion technique that preserves gradient information during fusion to enable detecting objects unrecognizable from individual vehicle perceptions alone. Experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate SiCP's state-of-the-art cooperative perception performance, surpassing methods like F-Cooper and AttFuse by over 8%, while achieving individual perception on par with leading standalone networks like PointPillars. Unlike other cooperative solutions, SiCP retains performance when operating without shared features. Moreover, DP-Net's plug-and-play nature allows integrating it into existing perception networks, empowering simultaneous individual and cooperative perception within a negligible 1.7% parameter increase. Overall, SiCP advances connected automated driving by unifying two key perception functionalities into a single lightweight solution.
