# [SiCP: Simultaneous Individual and Cooperative Perception for 3D Object   Detection in Connected and Automated Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04822)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SiCP, a unified perception framework for connected and automated vehicles that supports both individual and cooperative perception within a single model. SiCP introduces a lightweight Dual-Perception Network (DP-Net) module that manages local features for individual perception and fuses features from neighbors for cooperative perception. The core of DP-Net is a complementary feature fusion technique that preserves gradient information during fusion to enable detecting objects unrecognizable from individual vehicle perceptions alone. Experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate SiCP's state-of-the-art cooperative perception performance, surpassing methods like F-Cooper and AttFuse by over 8%, while achieving individual perception on par with leading standalone networks like PointPillars. Unlike other cooperative solutions, SiCP retains performance when operating without shared features. Moreover, DP-Net's plug-and-play nature allows integrating it into existing perception networks, empowering simultaneous individual and cooperative perception within a negligible 1.7% parameter increase. Overall, SiCP advances connected automated driving by unifying two key perception functionalities into a single lightweight solution.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cooperative perception leverages connectivity between vehicles to share sensor data and improve environmental awareness. However, existing cooperative perception models suffer significant performance declines when operating without shared feature maps from other vehicles.  
- This poses adoption challenges as vehicles have limited resources to concurrently run separate models for individual and cooperative perception.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Simultaneous Individual and Cooperative Perception (SiCP), a unified framework to support both individual and cooperative perception within a single model.

- SiCP contains a feature extractor, Dual-Perception Network (DP-Net), and detection head. The lightweight DP-Net acts as a conduit for individual perception and enables efficient feature map fusion from other vehicles.  

- DP-Net uses a novel complementary feature fusion technique to retain gradients during fusion. This preserves information to detect objects recognizable from only one vehicle's view.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to concurrently enable individual and cooperative perception with no performance decline.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art in cooperative perception while matching individual perception performance.  
- Lightweight DP-Net seamlessly integrates into existing models, adding only 0.13M parameters.
- Enables both perception modes within one model, reducing resource demands.
- Framework facilitates continued research into components like feature extraction and fusion for simultaneous perception.

In summary, the paper makes pivotal contributions in making cooperative perception more practical through a unified model without compromising individual capabilities. The proposed SiCP framework and DP-Net module pave the way for adoption in resource-constrained vehicles.
