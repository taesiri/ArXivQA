# [Passive Micron-scale Time-of-Flight with Sunlight Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10732)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we develop a completely passive interferometric technique for micron-scale 3D sensing that uses sunlight as the only light source?

The paper introduces a passive interferometric technique that uses sunlight as illumination to capture full-frame time-of-flight measurements at axial resolutions of 5 micrometers. The technique also takes advantage of the spatial incoherence of sunlight to enable robust 3D sensing insensitive to indirect illumination effects like interreflections and subsurface scattering.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that sunlight interferometry can enable passive, micrometer-scale 3D sensing robust to indirect illumination, through the use of sunlight's temporal and spatial incoherence properties. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability experimentally through an interferometer prototype operated under outdoor conditions.
