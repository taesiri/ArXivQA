 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Transferable Reinforcement Learning via Generalized Occupancy Models":

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to quickly adapt and generalize to new tasks in order to be deployed in the real world. Model-based RL methods learn a task-agnostic dynamics model of the environment, allowing generalization to new rewards. However, they suffer from compounding error over long horizons due to reliance on one-step models. On the other hand, model-free RL methods directly optimize policies for a single reward, without compounding error but lacking generalization. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes generalized occupancy models (GOMs) which retain the generalization benefit of model-based RL while avoiding compounding errors. The key ideas are:

1) Model the distribution $p(\psi|s)$ of all possible long-term cumulative feature outcomes $\psi=\sum_t \gamma^{t-1} g(s_t)$ from each state $s$, instead of modeling one-step transitions. This avoids compounding error.

2) Features $g(s)$ are chosen such that rewards $r(s)$ can be expressed as linear functions of them. This allows modeling outcomes in a reward-agnostic way.  

3) Model all possible outcomes rather than those under a specific policy. This makes the model policy-agnostic.

The distribution $p(\psi|s)$ is paired with a policy $\pi(a|s,\psi)$ that achieves a desired outcome $\psi$. For a new reward, weights $w_r$ are fitted and the $\psi$ with highest $w_r^\top\psi$ is achieved using $\pi(a|s,\psi)$.

Contributions:
1) Proposes GOMs as a new class of models for transferable RL without compounding error.

2) Provides a practical algorithm to learn GOMs using diffusion models.

3) Analyzes theoretical properties including error propagation and comparisons to model-based RL.

4) Empirically demonstrates transfer capabilities across various simulated robotic tasks with different reward functions.
