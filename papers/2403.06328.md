# [Transferable Reinforcement Learning via Generalized Occupancy Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Transferable Reinforcement Learning via Generalized Occupancy Models":

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to quickly adapt and generalize to new tasks in order to be deployed in the real world. Model-based RL methods learn a task-agnostic dynamics model of the environment, allowing generalization to new rewards. However, they suffer from compounding error over long horizons due to reliance on one-step models. On the other hand, model-free RL methods directly optimize policies for a single reward, without compounding error but lacking generalization. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes generalized occupancy models (GOMs) which retain the generalization benefit of model-based RL while avoiding compounding errors. The key ideas are:

1) Model the distribution $p(\psi|s)$ of all possible long-term cumulative feature outcomes $\psi=\sum_t \gamma^{t-1} g(s_t)$ from each state $s$, instead of modeling one-step transitions. This avoids compounding error.

2) Features $g(s)$ are chosen such that rewards $r(s)$ can be expressed as linear functions of them. This allows modeling outcomes in a reward-agnostic way.  

3) Model all possible outcomes rather than those under a specific policy. This makes the model policy-agnostic.

The distribution $p(\psi|s)$ is paired with a policy $\pi(a|s,\psi)$ that achieves a desired outcome $\psi$. For a new reward, weights $w_r$ are fitted and the $\psi$ with highest $w_r^\top\psi$ is achieved using $\pi(a|s,\psi)$.

Contributions:
1) Proposes GOMs as a new class of models for transferable RL without compounding error.

2) Provides a practical algorithm to learn GOMs using diffusion models.

3) Analyzes theoretical properties including error propagation and comparisons to model-based RL.

4) Empirically demonstrates transfer capabilities across various simulated robotic tasks with different reward functions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes generalized occupancy models, a new class of models that retain the ability of model-based reinforcement learning to generalize across tasks while avoiding the compounding error problem, by directly modeling long-term outcomes in a reward and policy agnostic way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new class of models called generalized occupancy models (GOMs) for transferable reinforcement learning. The key ideas behind GOMs are:

1) Reward-agnostic cumulative feature modeling: Instead of modeling immediate rewards or next states like in typical RL algorithms, GOMs model the distribution over cumulative feature sums over long-term trajectories. This allows sharing predictions across different rewards. 

2) Policy-agnostic all-paths modeling: Rather than conditioning on a particular policy like in off-policy RL, GOMs model the distribution over all possible long-term outcomes in the environment subject to the coverage of the offline dataset. This allows synthesizing optimal policies for new tasks.

3) Avoiding compounding errors: By directly modeling long-term outcomes instead of autoregressively predicting next states, GOMs avoid the compounding error challenges typical in model-based RL.

The main contribution is the proposal of GOMs as a new class of models for transferable RL that retain the benefits of model-based RL like multi-task generalization while avoiding issues like compounding error. The authors show theoretically and empirically that GOMs can enable quick adaptation to new tasks without needing expensive planning or policy optimization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Generalized occupancy models (GOMs): The novel models proposed in the paper for transferable reinforcement learning without compounding error. GOMs model the distribution over all possible long-term outcomes from a state.

- Transferable reinforcement learning: The problem setting of developing reinforcement learning agents that can generalize broadly across different tasks/reward functions. GOMs aim to enable quick adaptation to new tasks.

- Compounding error: The issue in model-based RL where small errors in a learned dynamics model accumulate over multi-step rollouts, limiting their effectiveness. GOMs avoid this issue by directly modeling long-term outcomes.

- Offline reinforcement learning: GOMs are trained on an unlabeled offline dataset of transitions to enable adaptation to downstream tasks.

- Diffusion models: Used in the paper as a practical instantiation for modeling the distribution over outcomes. Allows efficient guided diffusion planning.

- Cumulants: Arbitrary state features that GOMs model the discounted sum of. Choosing cumulants such that rewards are linear in them enables transferability.

So in summary - generalized occupancy models, transferable RL, compounding error, offline RL, diffusion models, and cumulants.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper models the distribution over all possible long-term outcomes $p(\psi|s)$. What are the challenges in modeling and representing this full distribution, compared to simply modeling the expected outcome?

2) The paper uses diffusion models to parameterize $p(\psi|s)$. What are the benefits of using diffusion models compared to other density models like normalizing flows? How does the choice of diffusion models impact the planning procedure?

3) The paper shows both a random shooting and guided diffusion procedure for planning. Compare and contrast the two methods. What are the tradeoffs in sample efficiency, ease of implementation, and optimality? 

4) The theoretical analysis shows that GOMs can recover optimal policies given full dataset coverage. Discuss the assumptions needed for this result and whether they are reasonable. How might the theoretical guarantees degrade with limited coverage?

5) How does the choice of cumulant features $g(s)$ impact the performance of GOMs? What properties should the cumulant function satisfy? How might the choice of features be adapted to particular environments?

6) The method trains a separate policy model $\pi(a|s, \psi)$ for control. Discuss whether it is possible to avoid having a separate policy and instead directly model actions. What would be the challenges in doing so?

7) The adaptation process requires fitting the regression weights $w_r$ at test time. How many samples are needed to estimate $w_r$ accurately? Is there a way to avoid this test time fitting?

8) Discuss the similarities and differences between GOMs and other related areas like successor features, model-based RL, and goal-conditioned RL. What are the pros and cons compared to these other approaches?

9) One could view GOMs as learning abstract options or skills using diffusion models. Elaborate on this perspective and how it relates to the idea of learning reusable skills.

10) The method currently models the on-policy distribution. How can we extend GOMs to leverage off-policy data more effectively? What changes would need to be made to the modeling procedure?
