# [Multiresolution Equivariant Graph Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00967v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we develop a deep generative model for graphs that captures multiresolution structure and respects permutation equivariance?

The paper proposes a new model called Multiresolution Graph Variational Autoencoder (MGVAE) to address this question. The key ideas are:

1) Learn a hierarchical latent representation by iteratively clustering graphs into subgraphs and encoding each subgraph separately. This captures the multiresolution structure. 

2) Use higher-order permutation equivariant graph neural networks for encoding/decoding at each level of the hierarchy. This respects permutation symmetry in node ordering.

3) Introduce a hierarchy of latent variable models that can stochastically generate graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner through the learned hierarchy.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the multiresolution structure in a permutation equivariant way will allow generating high-quality graph-structured data like molecules. The MGVAE model is proposed to test this hypothesis.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the key contributions of the paper:

1. The paper proposes Multiresolution Equivariant Graph Variational Autoencoders (MGVAE), which is the first hierarchical generative model capable of learning and generating graphs in a multiresolution and equivariant manner. 

2. The model utilizes higher order message passing to encode graphs at each resolution level while learning to partition the graph into clusters and coarsen it into a lower resolution graph, creating a hierarchy of latent distributions.

3. The decoding process variationally reconstructs the hierarchy of coarsened graphs in an equivariant manner which preserves permutation symmetry with respect to node ordering.

4. The proposed MGVAE framework achieves competitive results on several graph generation tasks including molecular graph generation, general graph generation, image generation using graphs, and unsupervised molecular representation learning.

5. The multiresolution coarsening procedure makes the model more efficient in terms of time and space complexity compared to existing graph generation methods.

6. The learnable clustering and coarsening allow the model to detect and reconstruct important substructures in graphs, especially chemical functional groups in molecules.

7. The model is the first to combine hierarchical variational autoencoders with learning graph coarsening/clustering in an end-to-end differentiable manner.

So in summary, the key innovation is proposing a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder that can generate graphs in a multiscale, equivariant manner by learning graph coarsening and clustering within the model. The multiresolution structure allows capturing important substructures and makes the model more efficient.
