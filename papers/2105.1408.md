# [Unsteady and inertial dynamics of an active particle in a fluid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.1408)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Is there a principle that allows known results on the inertial dynamics of passive particles to be translated to active particles (like motile microorganisms)? 2) Can this principle be used to answer specific questions about how fluid inertia affects active particles, such as:- Why is the history force the same for active and passive particles? - How does the history force depend on particle shape?- Do active particles experience lift forces analogous to Saffman's lift force in shear flows?- How are active particles affected by fluid rotation, stratification, etc?3) What are the limitations of this principle? When and why does it fail?The overall goal seems to be to establish a general framework to deduce inertial effects on active particles based on known results for passive particles. The paper then provides an example application of the principle and discusses its limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It shows how a fundamental principle used by Legendre & Magnaudet to determine the inertial lift on a bubble in shear flow can be applied more generally to infer inertial corrections to the hydrodynamic force on active microswimmers. 2. It demonstrates how this principle allows translating known results for inertial effects on passive particles to active particles, as long as the perturbation equations close to the swimmer are essentially Stokes equations.3. It provides specific examples of how the principle can be applied, such as deriving the history force on a spherical squirmer and analyzing active particles in shear flows. 4. It discusses the limitations of the principle, namely that it fails for problems where convective inertia dominates, like the Oseen problem. 5. It raises open questions about how convective inertia affects the history force on active swimmers and how the different inertial effects compete in determining the motion of microswimmers like jumping copepods.In summary, the key contribution is introducing and demonstrating a general principle for inferring inertial corrections on active swimmers, which helps translate knowledge about inertial effects on passive particles to the active realm. The paper provides both theoretical framework and concrete examples of applying this principle.
