# [Towards Unified Task Embeddings Across Multiple Models: Bridging the Gap   for Prompt-Based Large Language Models and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14522)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing task embedding methods rely on fine-tuned, task-specific language models, limiting their adaptability across diverse models like prompt-based large language models (LLMs). 
- Current methods cannot generate unified task embeddings across multiple models for comparison and analysis.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a model-agnostic framework, FUTE, to generate unified task embeddings across models within a single vector space.
- Decouple task embedding into two forms: Dataset Task Embedding (DTE) to capture dataset characteristics, and Model Task Embedding (MTE) to encapsulate model behavior.
- Compute DTE and MTE independently using a surrogate model on unsupervised data, without needing the original models or training data.
- Treat prompt+LLM combination as a model to compute MTE, enabling task embeddings for prompt-guided LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- Propose FUTE framework for unified task embeddings across diverse models like different language models and prompt-guided LLMs.
- Conceptualize distinct forms of dataset task embedding and model task embedding.
- Demonstrate FUTE's ability to compute task embeddings for LLMs using prompts.
- Experiments show FUTE achieves performance comparable to architecture-specific methods, while being more versatile.
- Analysis reveals insights into relationships between tasks, models, prompts based on learned unified task embeddings.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel framework FUTE to compute unified task embeddings across diverse models, decoupling them into dataset and model embeddings, with evaluations demonstrating its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a unified framework called FUTE that can learn task embeddings adapted for diverse models ranging from different neural architectures to large language models with various prompts, enabling cross-model similarity comparisons and analysis within a single vector space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a unified framework called FUTE (Framework for Unified Task Embedding) that can learn task embeddings from diverse models, including language models with different architectures and large language models (LLMs) with various prompts, within a single vector space. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing FUTE, a model-agnostic framework that decouples task embedding into two forms - Dataset Task Embedding (DTE) and Model Task Embedding (MTE). This facilitates learning unified task embeddings across models.

2) Introducing an approach to compute model-specific MTEs using an additional surrogate model and unsupervised data, without needing the original training data. This allows extending task embeddings to models like prompt-guided LLMs. 

3) Demonstrating that FUTE can effectively incorporate diverse models like smaller language models and LLMs with different prompts into a unified embedding space, while retaining performance comparable to architecture-specific methods.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a versatile framework FUTE that can unify task embeddings from a diverse range of models within the same vector space to enable cross-model similarity comparison and analysis.
