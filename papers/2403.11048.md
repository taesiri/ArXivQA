# [JustQ: Automated Deployment of Fair and Accurate Quantum Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11048)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining traction for automated decision-making systems, but their fairness is largely unexplored, with most works focusing solely on accuracy. 
- Prior works lack comprehensive error models and measurement methods for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. They also overlook the significant impact of the QNN deployment phase on both accuracy and fairness.

Proposed Solution - JustQ Framework:
- Includes a complete NISQ error model and measurement method to account for all noise sources (gate, readout, crosstalk errors).
- Uses a reinforcement learning-based approach to automatically explore the design space and generate optimized QNN deployment solutions for maximizing both fairness and accuracy.  
- Formulates a flexible optimization objective function with customizable weights to balance fairness and accuracy based on specific application requirements.

Key Contributions:
- Conducted a thorough design space exploration, unveiling fairness issues in QNNs and highlighting the substantial influence of deployment settings and quantum noise on accuracy and fairness tradeoffs.
- Proposed the JustQ framework for automated, fair and accurate QNN deployment on NISQ devices. It outperforms prior methods in optimizing for both accuracy and fairness metrics.
- Pioneered research in fair QNN design on NISQ computers. The adaptable optimization function enables customization based on unique application needs.

In summary, this paper focuses on the overlooked problem of fairness in QNNs. It proposes the novel JustQ framework to automate the search for optimized and fair QNN deployment solutions on NISQ devices. A key highlight is the flexible multi-objective function to balance accuracy and fairness.
