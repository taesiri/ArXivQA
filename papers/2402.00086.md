# [Retrosynthesis prediction enhanced by in-silico reaction data   augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Retrosynthesis prediction is challenging even for experts due to the huge search space of possible chemical transformations. Recent ML methods have shown promise to assist chemists but rely heavily on paired training data (product-reactant pairs), which is expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. Companies also view such data as valuable assets and limit access. These issues impede progress on more effective retrosynthesis models. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors present RetroWISE, a self-boosting framework that generates in-silico paired reaction data from easily accessible unpaired data (either reactants or products alone) to augment real paired data for training improved models. It has a base model trained on real data that generates in-silico reactions from unpaired data. These cheap reactions then augment real costly reactions as training data for a superior model. A filter process with template matching and molecular similarity comparison also enhances in-silico data quality.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first framework to generate in-silico reactions for augmenting limited real reactions to train more accurate retrosynthesis prediction models in a self-boosting manner
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on 3 benchmark datasets, outperforming previous best methods by 4-9% in top-1 accuracy 
- Shows consistent and significant improvements in predicting rare reactions and across almost all reaction types
- Highlights feasibility of alleviating data scarcity issues via in-silico augmentation to advance ML-based retrosynthesis research

The key idea is that real paired data trains a base model to generate unpaired to paired in-silico reactions, which then boosts the base model itself iteratively. This self-boosting process with cheap in-silico data facilitates model evolution to overcome training bottlenecks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a self-boosting framework called RetroWISE that uses a base model trained on real paired data to generate in-silico reactions from easily accessible unpaired data, which are then used to augment the real paired data to train an improved retrosynthesis prediction model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting a framework called RetroWISE that uses a base model trained on real paired data to generate in-silico reactions from easily accessible unpaired data. These cheap in-silico reactions are then used to augment the costly real reactions as training data to develop a more effective ML model for retrosynthesis prediction. In this way, the framework is "self-boosted" - the in-silico reactions generated by the base model help push the model itself to evolve and improve. The results on benchmark datasets show that RetroWISE achieves state-of-the-art performance for retrosynthesis prediction. So in summary, the key innovation is using in-silico reaction data augmentation in a self-boosting manner to overcome the training data bottleneck and advance retrosynthesis prediction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

Retrosynthesis, Machine Learning, In-silico Reaction Data Augmentation, Self-boosting Framework

The abstract clearly states these keywords: "Here, we present a framework called \Ours~that uses a base model inferred from real paired data to generate in-silico reactions from unpaired data (\ie, one component of the product-reactant(s) pair), which can be more easily collected in public databases or via web scraping, to develop a more effective ML model."

So the key ideas involve using machine learning for retrosynthesis prediction, augmenting the training data with in-silico (computer-generated) reactions, and having a self-boosting framework that iterates to improve the model.
