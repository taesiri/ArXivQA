# [3D Human Pose Perception from Egocentric Stereo Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for egocentric 3D human pose estimation using head-mounted stereo cameras have limitations in accuracy due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusions, and not fully utilizing the stereo video inputs. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new transformer-based framework for accurate egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation from compact eyeglasses-based devices. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage scene information from a video-based 3D scene reconstruction module. This module uses Structure from Motion (SfM) on uniformly sampled windows of stereo frames to obtain depth maps and camera poses. 

2) Enhance joint queries using temporal features from stereo inputs through a video-dependent query augmentation technique. This captures the temporal context of motions.  

3) Handle missing depth values in some frames via depth padding masks in the transformer attention.

The framework has four main modules:
1) 2D pose estimation module to detect 2D heatmaps 
2) Human segmentation module using heatmaps  
3) 3D scene reconstruction module using SfM
4) Transformer-based 3D module using enhanced joint queries to output 3D poses

Main Contributions:

1) Novel transformer-based network designed specifically for the egocentric stereo setting that accounts for scene information and temporal context

2) Video-based 3D scene reconstruction module to obtain depth cues 

3) Techniques to handle missing depth values during training 

4) Video-dependent query augmentation policy to leverage temporal relations in motions

5) Two new benchmark datasets captured with a novel compact stereo device: UnrealEgo2 (synthetic) and UnrealEgo-RW (real-world)

Experiments demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by >15% on UnrealEgo, ≥40% on UnrealEgo2 and ≥10% on UnrealEgo-RW.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new transformer-based framework for egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation from compact eyeglasses-based devices that leverages scene information and temporal context of input videos to significantly improve accuracy compared to previous methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A new transformer-based framework for egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation that accounts for temporal context in egocentric stereo videos. 

2) 3D pose estimation is enhanced via the utilization of scene information from their video-based 3D scene reconstruction module and joint queries obtained from their video-dependent query augmentation policy.

3) Introduction of two new benchmark datasets: UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW. UnrealEgo2 is an extended version of UnrealEgo and is the largest eyeglasses-based synthetic data with various new motions. UnrealEgo-RW is a real-world dataset recorded with their newly developed device that resembles the virtual eyeglasses-based setup, offering real-world footage with ground truth 3D poses. These datasets allow for comprehensive evaluation of methods for egocentric 3D human pose estimation from stereo views.
