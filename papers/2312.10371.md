# [K-ESConv: Knowledge Injection for Emotional Support Dialogue Systems via   Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing pre-trained language models (PLMs) for psychological consultation systems have two main limitations:
1) Scarcity of psychological counseling data makes models difficult to train fully.  
2) These systems lack professional knowledge required for providing quality emotional support.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes K-ESConv, a novel prompt learning based knowledge injection method to transfer knowledge from online counseling forums to emotional support dialogue systems. 

The key components of K-ESConv are:
1) Knowledge-Aware Prompt Encoder (KPE): Encodes retrieved external knowledge into knowledge-aware prompts to inject knowledge. 
2) Context-Aware Prompt Encoder (CPE): Encodes conversation context into context-aware prompts.
3) Response Generation Decoder (RGD): Generates responses conditioned on combination of knowledge and context prompt encodings.

For knowledge selection, a pretrained dense retriever is used.

Main Contributions:
1) A prompt learning framework to incorporate both context and external knowledge for generating informed and empathetic responses.
2) Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both automatic and human evaluations.
3) Significantly improves correlation, diversity, and professionalism of generated responses.
4) Provides more helpful suggestions and comfort for the seeker.

In summary, the paper makes meaningful progress in developing knowledgeable and empathetic dialogue systems for emotional support conversations. The proposed K-ESConv method shows promise for real-world applications.
