# [TextGAIL: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13796)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can generative adversarial networks (GANs) be improved for text generation by incorporating large pre-trained language models and using generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Previous text GANs have performed worse than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods because they lack good reward signals in their discriminators. 

2) By leveraging large pre-trained language models like RoBERTa and GPT-2, more reliable reward signals can be provided to improve text GANs.

3) Applying GAIL and optimization methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO) can help stabilize and improve text GAN training.

4) With these modifications, text GANs can achieve better performance than MLE baselines in terms of both quality and diversity on a variety of text generation tasks.

So in summary, the central research question is whether incorporating large language models and GAIL into text GANs can address issues with previous text GANs and lead to improved performance over MLE methods across different text generation tasks. The paper seems focused on testing those key hypotheses through experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing TextGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for text generation that leverages large pre-trained language models like RoBERTa and GPT-2. The key points are:

- TextGAIL applies generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) along with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to improve the stability and performance of text generation with GANs. 

- It uses a contrastive discriminator instead of a regular binary classifier to better distinguish between real and generated text, especially for conditional generation tasks.

- It leverages large pretrained language models GPT-2 and RoBERTa as the generator and discriminator respectively to provide stronger initialization.

- Experiments on diverse unconditional and conditional text generation tasks show TextGAIL achieves better performance in terms of quality and diversity compared to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) baselines.

- Analysis shows the discriminator in TextGAIL learns to provide meaningful rewards to guide the generator, as evidenced by its strong performance on a story ending classification task.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective framework TextGAIL that combines GANs, imitation learning, contrastive discrimination and pretrained language models for improved text generation. The results demonstrate the promise of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a generative adversarial imitation learning framework called TextGAIL for text generation that leverages large pre-trained language models like GPT-2 and RoBERTa to provide more reliable reward signals, and applies contrastive discriminators and proximal policy optimization to improve training stability and performance over standard maximum likelihood estimation fine-tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research on generative adversarial imitation learning for text:

- This paper proposes TextGAIL, a new framework for training GANs on text generation tasks using generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). Other papers have explored using GANs and reinforcement learning for text, but this is one of the first to specifically apply GAIL in this domain.

- A key contribution is incorporating large pre-trained language models (GPT-2 and RoBERTa) into the generator and discriminator. This allows TextGAIL to leverage the knowledge from pre-training, unlike most prior GAN approaches that train from scratch. 

- The authors use proximal policy optimization (PPO) to optimize the generator policy. Other text GAN methods like SeqGAN used reinforcement learning algorithms like REINFORCE, but PPO helps stabilize training.

- For the discriminator, they propose a "contrastive" approach to estimate relative realness between samples. This differs from the binary classifiers used in most text GAN papers.

- The evaluation methodology using temperature sweep and quality-diversity tradeoffs follows recent best practices established in papers like Caccia et al. This allows fair comparison to MLE baselines.

- Experiments cover both unconditional and conditional text generation across multiple datasets. Many prior text GAN papers focused solely on unconditional generation on limited datasets. 

- Results show TextGAIL outperforming MLE baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, unlike many previous text GAN approaches. The analysis also sheds light on the discriminator's learned rewards.

In summary, this paper makes several noteworthy contributions in generative adversarial learning for text by utilizing pre-trained models, new training stabilization methods, and more rigorous evaluation. The results demonstrate improved performance over MLE and prior GAN methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different optimization methods for TextGAIL beyond PPO to improve stability and sample efficiency. The authors mention TRPO as one possibility. 

- Adapting TextGAIL to other conditional and unconditional text generation tasks beyond the ones explored in the paper. Evaluating the effectiveness of TextGAIL on a wider range of tasks.

- Improving the discriminator to provide even more useful rewards by incorporating additional knowledge sources beyond pre-training. The authors suggest incorporating commonsense knowledge graphs as one possibility.

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for text generation that better correlate with human judgments, since relying solely on human evaluation is expensive. The authors propose "Perception Score" as one idea but note its limitations.

- Speeding up the decoding/sampling process for Transformer models to make TextGAIL training more efficient. The authors note the decoding is a computational bottleneck currently.

- Analyzing what linguistic knowledge the discriminator learns and how it provides improved rewards compared to language model probabilities. The authors provide some analysis but more investigation could be done.

- Applying TextGAIL to conditional tasks with much longer input context, to see if the improvements observed on short contexts translate to longer contexts.

- Comparing TextGAIL directly to other recent conditional text GAN methods in an ablation study, if those methods can be adapted to pretrained models.

So in summary, the main directions are: exploring optimization methods, evaluating on more tasks, improving the discriminator, developing better automatic evaluation metrics, speeding up decoding, analyzing learned knowledge, testing on longer contexts, and direct comparison to other text GAN methods. The authors provide good discussions of the limitations and future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TextGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for text generation. TextGAIL leverages large pre-trained language models like GPT-2 and RoBERTa to provide more reliable rewards during adversarial training. The authors find that directly combining previous adversarial approaches with large pre-trained models does not work well due to high gradient variance and architecture limitations. To address these issues, TextGAIL utilizes generative adversarial imitation learning and proximal policy optimization to stabilize training and improve performance. For evaluation, the authors conduct experiments on a range of unconditional and conditional text generation tasks. Compared to maximum likelihood estimation baselines, TextGAIL achieves better performance in terms of both quality and diversity based on automatic and human evaluations. The results validate the authors' intuition that the discriminator in TextGAIL is able to provide reasonable rewards thanks to the pre-trained models.

In summary, this paper proposes TextGAIL, a generative adversarial framework for text generation that leverages large pre-trained language models to provide reward guidance. TextGAIL applies imitation learning and policy optimization techniques to stabilize training. Experiments across different text generation tasks demonstrate TextGAIL's improved performance over maximum likelihood estimation baselines in terms of quality and diversity. The results suggest pre-trained models can help learn useful rewards for text generation using adversarial training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes TextGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for text generation. TextGAIL uses a generator G and a discriminator D. The generator G is based on the GPT-2 language model and generates text sequences to fool the discriminator. The discriminator D uses the RoBERTa model and is trained to distinguish between real text sequences and sequences generated by G. To reduce high variance in gradients, TextGAIL employs proximal policy optimization (PPO) to update G. It also mixes in some real examples from the training data when updating G to further stabilize training. The discriminator D is designed as a contrastive discriminator, which compares a real and fake sequence side-by-side and predicts which is more realistic. This framework is applied to both unconditional text generation tasks like COCO image captions as well as conditional generation tasks like CommonGEN and ROCStories. Experiments demonstrate that TextGAIL achieves better quality and diversity than maximum likelihood estimation baselines. The learned discriminator also shows an ability to classify realistic story endings, suggesting it provides meaningful reward signals to guide G.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of generative adversarial networks (GANs) underperforming compared to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) models for text generation. Some key points:

- GANs have been proposed to address the exposure bias problem with MLE training, where there is a discrepancy between how models are trained and how they are used at test time. However, recent work has shown that text GANs generate lower quality and less diverse text compared to MLE models. 

- The authors hypothesize that previous text GANs have inferior performance because they lack reliable guiding signals in their discriminators. They propose a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) framework called TextGAIL that uses large pre-trained language models like RoBERTa and GPT-2 to provide better reward signals.

- To improve training stability and performance, the authors apply techniques like contrastive discriminators, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and mixing in human demonstrations. 

- Experiments across diverse unconditional and conditional text generation tasks show TextGAIL achieves better performance in terms of quality and diversity compared to MLE baselines.

In summary, the key problem is that previous text GANs underperform compared to MLE, likely due to unreliable discriminator rewards. The authors aim to address this through a GAIL framework augmented with large pre-trained language models and training improvements.
