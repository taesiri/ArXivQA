# TextGAIL: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for Text Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can generative adversarial networks (GANs) be improved for text generation by incorporating large pre-trained language models and using generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Previous text GANs have performed worse than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods because they lack good reward signals in their discriminators. 2) By leveraging large pre-trained language models like RoBERTa and GPT-2, more reliable reward signals can be provided to improve text GANs.3) Applying GAIL and optimization methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO) can help stabilize and improve text GAN training.4) With these modifications, text GANs can achieve better performance than MLE baselines in terms of both quality and diversity on a variety of text generation tasks.So in summary, the central research question is whether incorporating large language models and GAIL into text GANs can address issues with previous text GANs and lead to improved performance over MLE methods across different text generation tasks. The paper seems focused on testing those key hypotheses through experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing TextGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for text generation that leverages large pre-trained language models like RoBERTa and GPT-2. The key points are:- TextGAIL applies generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) along with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to improve the stability and performance of text generation with GANs. - It uses a contrastive discriminator instead of a regular binary classifier to better distinguish between real and generated text, especially for conditional generation tasks.- It leverages large pretrained language models GPT-2 and RoBERTa as the generator and discriminator respectively to provide stronger initialization.- Experiments on diverse unconditional and conditional text generation tasks show TextGAIL achieves better performance in terms of quality and diversity compared to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) baselines.- Analysis shows the discriminator in TextGAIL learns to provide meaningful rewards to guide the generator, as evidenced by its strong performance on a story ending classification task.In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective framework TextGAIL that combines GANs, imitation learning, contrastive discrimination and pretrained language models for improved text generation. The results demonstrate the promise of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a generative adversarial imitation learning framework called TextGAIL for text generation that leverages large pre-trained language models like GPT-2 and RoBERTa to provide more reliable reward signals, and applies contrastive discriminators and proximal policy optimization to improve training stability and performance over standard maximum likelihood estimation fine-tuning.
