# [SiLLM: Large Language Models for Simultaneous Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) starts generating translations before reading the entire source sentence, which is useful for real-time applications. 
- SiMT models require a policy to determine when to read source words and generate target words. 
- Existing SiMT methods use a single transformer model for both policy decisions and translation, which exceeds the capability of a single model. 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in language generation tasks but have not been well explored for SiMT.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SiLLM, which uses separate agents for policy decisions and translation to leverage capabilities of LLMs for SiMT
- Policy agent: Conventional transformer-based SiMT model that handles when to read/generate
- Translation agent: LLM that focuses solely on translation generation
- Agents collaborate by sharing memory that stores source/target sentences
- Propose word-level policy derived from token-level policies of SiMT models to address vocabulary mismatch with LLM
- Further fine-tune LLM with full sentence translation data 

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework to incorporate LLMs into SiMT using collaborative agents
- State-of-the-art SiMT performance by leveraging strengths of conventional SiMT models and LLMs
- Demonstrates LLMs can learn to translate well from partial source context without needing explicit SiMT style training data
- Analysis shows lower hallucination rates and consistent improvements, especially for longer latencies

In summary, the key innovation is decomposing SiMT into policy decisions and translation to create a collaborative framework between conventional SiMT models and LLMs. This achieves new state-of-the-art results by effectively utilizing capabilities of both types of models.
