## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) to alleviate the challenge of limited labeled data for training deep neural networks. PTMs follow a two-phase learning framework - a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, the model is trained on a large amount of unlabeled data to learn versatile knowledge using self-supervised objectives like masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This allows the model to capture useful linguistic knowledge from the unlabeled data without manual supervision. In the fine-tuning phase, the pre-trained model is adapted to specific downstream tasks using labeled data. As the model has already learned useful knowledge in the pre-training phase, it requires much less labeled data in the fine-tuning phase to perform well on downstream tasks. So the main innovation of PTMs is to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data through self-supervised pre-training objectives to reduce reliance on labeled data for downstream tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to train effective deep neural models for specific artificial intelligence (AI) tasks with limited labeled training data. The key question it examines is how pre-trained models (PTMs) can help alleviate the challenge of needing large annotated datasets to train deep neural networks.

The main points made in the paper are:

- Deep neural networks like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers have achieved success on many AI tasks, but a key challenge is that they require large amounts of training data and can easily overfit without sufficient data samples. Manually annotating lots of training data is expensive and infeasible for some complex tasks.

- Transfer learning via pre-training provides a way to reduce the data needs of deep networks. PTMs first capture versatile knowledge from unlabeled data or related tasks, which is then transferred to improve learning on target tasks with limited labeled data. 

- Supervised pre-training of CNNs played a key role in computer vision advances. More recently, self-supervised pre-training of Transformers has driven breakthroughs in NLP via models like BERT. These PTMs capture linguistic knowledge from large text corpora.

- With increasing model scale and data, PTMs have shown impressive abilities like few-shot learning. But fundamental questions remain about the nature of the knowledge encoded in their parameters, and their computational efficiency needs improvement.

- The paper reviews the history of pre-training and positions recent Transformer PTMs like BERT in the broader AI spectrum. It discusses ongoing work to improve PTMs via architecture design, using multi-modal data, enhancing efficiency, and analysis. It also examines open problems and future directions.

In summary, the key focus is examining how pre-training deep neural networks can reduce reliance on large labeled datasets, which is a major challenge in applying them to real-world AI tasks. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the progress, open problems and future opportunities in developing more effective and efficient PTMs.
