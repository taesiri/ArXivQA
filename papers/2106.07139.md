Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on pre-trained models in natural language processing:- It provides a comprehensive overview of the history and development of pre-trained models, tracing their evolution from early transfer learning approaches to the latest self-supervised methods like BERT. Many other papers focus only on a specific model or time period. - The paper categorizes recent advances in pre-trained models into four main directions - model architectures, using rich contexts, improving efficiency, and analysis/interpretation. This provides a clear framework for understanding the many different strains of research happening in parallel.- The paper covers pre-trained models for both natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. Some prior surveys have focused only on models for one or the other. - The paper discusses open problems and future directions in depth. Many papers on pre-trained models are narrowly focused on proposing a new model or technique. This paper takes a broader view of where the field is heading.- The paper incorporates multilingual, multimodal, and knowledge-enhanced pre-trained models in its analysis. Some other surveys limit discussion primarily to models pre-trained on monolingual text.- The paper proposes the notion of "modeledge" to describe the implicit knowledge captured by pre-trained models, contrasting it with symbolic knowledge representations. This provides a new lens for understanding these models.Overall, the scope of this paper is unusually broad and comprehensive compared to prior work, providing both a historical context and an extensive discussion of current progress and future directions in pre-trained models for natural language processing. The proposed framework and overview of open problems make a valuable synthesis and analysis of this fast moving field.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper provides a comprehensive review of pre-trained models (PTMs) for natural language processing tasks. It first traces the history of PTMs, from early transfer learning methods to recent self-supervised learning techniques like BERT. The key innovation enabling large-scale PTMs is the Transformer architecture combined with self-supervised objectives like masked language modeling.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new framework called Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) to alleviate the challenge of limited labeled data for training deep neural networks. PTMs follow a two-phase learning framework - a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, the model is trained on a large amount of unlabeled data to learn versatile knowledge using self-supervised objectives like masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This allows the model to capture useful linguistic knowledge from the unlabeled data without manual supervision. In the fine-tuning phase, the pre-trained model is adapted to specific downstream tasks using labeled data. As the model has already learned useful knowledge in the pre-training phase, it requires much less labeled data in the fine-tuning phase to perform well on downstream tasks. So the main innovation of PTMs is to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data through self-supervised pre-training objectives to reduce reliance on labeled data for downstream tasks.
