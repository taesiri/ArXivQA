# [Value-Driven Mixed-Precision Quantization for Patch-Based Inference on   Microcontrollers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Deploying neural networks on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to their limited memory and computation capabilities. 
- Existing techniques like model compression and efficient architectures still struggle to fit complex models on MCUs.
- Recently proposed patch-based inference splits the input into patches and processes each patch sequentially, reducing memory usage but causing high redundancy and latency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes QuantMCU, a patch-based inference approach using value-driven mixed-precision quantization to reduce redundancy.
- It first classifies patches into outlier and non-outlier based on whether they contain outlier activation values. 
- Outlier patches and their branch are 8-bit quantized while non-outlier patches undergo a fast quantization search called VDQS.
- VDQS defines a quantization score based on change in entropy (for accuracy) and BitOPs (for computation) to guide the search. 
- It assigns bitwidths iteratively while meeting memory constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes value-driven patch classification (VDPC) to maintain accuracy by identifying and handling outlier patches differently.
- Proposes lightweight value-driven quantization search (VDQS) based on a new quantization score metric and iterative search.
- Reduces computation by 2.2x and latency by 1.5x compared to prior patch-based techniques, with negligible accuracy loss.
- VDQS finds efficient mixed-precision configurations in minutes compared to hours with other search methods.
- Evaluated on real MCUs using image classification and object detection networks.

In summary, QuantMCU reduces the redundancy in patch-based inference by selectively handling outlier patches and efficiently searching for a mixed-precision configuration for non-outlier patches, outperforming prior patch-based techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes QuantMCU, a novel patch-based inference approach that uses value-driven mixed-precision quantization to reduce redundant computation while maintaining model accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing value-driven patch classification (VDPC) to classify patches into outlier and non-outlier classes in order to maintain model accuracy during quantization. 

2. Applying value-driven quantization search (VDQS) on the non-outlier patches and associated dataflow branches to reduce quantization search time. VDQS uses a new search metric based on entropy and BitOPs to avoid retraining, and an iterative search method to determine bitwidths.

3. Implementing QuantMCU on real-world MCUs and showing it can reduce computation (BitOPs) of previous patch-based methods by an average of 2.2x and inference latency by 1.5x, while maintaining comparable model accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the QuantMCU approach to effectively reduce redundant computation in patch-based inference on MCUs through value-driven mixed-precision quantization, while preserving model accuracy. The key ideas are VDPC and VDQS.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Value-driven Patch Classification (VDPC) to classify patches into outlier and non-outlier classes. What is the intuition behind this classification? How is the optimal threshold Ï† determined to separate outlier and non-outlier values?

2. The paper introduces a new search metric called Quantization Score. Explain the components of this metric and how it balances computation and accuracy. How is entropy used to represent accuracy?

8. How does the method balance maintaining accuracy versus reducing computation? Discuss any accuracy/efficiency tradeoffs observed.

9. Compared to other mixed-precision quantization techniques, what makes the search process more efficient? Discuss differences to techniques like reinforcement learning and neural architecture search.
