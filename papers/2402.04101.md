# [VRMM: A Volumetric Relightable Morphable Head Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing volumetric facial prior models have limitations in modeling dynamic facial expressions and simulating variable lighting conditions on the face. They also tend to overfit when used for downstream facial reconstruction tasks from images. These limitations hamper the capability to generate high-quality, animatable and relightable avatars from image inputs.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes VRMM, a novel volumetric and parametric 3D facial prior model. The key aspects are:

1) Disentangled latent spaces: VRMM employs a self-supervised training framework to disentangle low-dimensional latent spaces for identity, expression and lighting. This allows modeling a full range of expressions and relighting capabilities.

2) Data-efficient training: The disentanglement and self-supervision significantly reduce constraints on the training data required. VRMM is trained on multi-view dynamic sequences of <300 subjects exhibiting varying expressions under controllable studio lighting.  

3) Prior-preserving personalization: A specially designed fitting pipeline preserves the prior while allowing accurate reconstruction from even a single image. This overcomes overfitting issues faced by generative volumetric models.

Main Contributions:

1) VRMM is the first volumetric 3D facial prior capable of continuous control over expression, identity and relighting.

2) A novel training framework to learn disentangled spaces of expression, identity and lighting from multi-view studio sequences. Reduces training data constraints.

3) A prior-preserving personalization method that retains generative capabilities of the model while enabling high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from few images.

4) State-of-the-art facial reconstruction, animation and relighting results from varied inputs demonstrate VRMM's effectiveness over previous volumetric methods.

In summary, VRMM advances facial modeling via a volumetric prior with disentangled editability, trained self-supervisedly for data efficiency. Coupled with tailored personalization, it can generate animatable and relightable avatars from few images.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents VRMM, a novel volumetric and parametric 3D face prior with disentangled low-dimensional latent spaces for identity, expression, and lighting that enables high-quality animatable and relightable avatar reconstruction from few-shot observations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting VRMM, the first 3D volumetric facial prior that is both continuously relightable and encompasses full range of expressions.

2. Proposing a novel training framework to learn the disentangled parametric space of expression, identity and lighting for VRMM from dynamic multi-view image sequences captured under controllable light conditions. 

3. Proposing a novel personalization method that is elaborately designed to keep the animatable and relightable properties provided by the prior, which enables high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from several or even one image.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrating that VRMM can be used in various applications and outperforms previous methods.

In summary, the key contribution is developing the first volumetric and parametric 3D face model (VRMM) that supports relighting, animation and high-quality few-shot avatar reconstruction through a specially designed training pipeline and inversion technique. The experiments validate the effectiveness of VRMM for facial analysis and synthesis compared to previous volumetric head models.
