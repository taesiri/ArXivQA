# [From One to Many: Expanding the Scope of Toxicity Mitigation in Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03893)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Toxicity mitigation techniques have focused almost entirely on English, despite the adoption of language models across diverse languages and cultures. As models become more multilingual, safety measures must also expand to multiple languages.  

- There is a lack of sufficient annotated datasets for toxicity across languages to evaluate mitigation techniques. Additionally, precisely measuring and comparing toxicity across languages is extremely challenging.

Approach:
- The authors evaluate toxicity mitigation techniques on 9 languages spanning 5 different scripts and multiple language families. Both high-resource (English, Romance languages) and mid-resource (Arabic, Hindi, Korean) languages are included.

- Translated versions of established English datasets (CivilComments, HolisticBias) are created in 8 other languages for training and evaluation. Translation quality and its impact are analyzed.  

- Two approaches are compared - DExperts (finetuning-based) and Goodtriever (retrieval-based). Both static and continual learning scenarios are examined.

- A standardized evaluation protocol using relative toxicity reduction is proposed to enable comparison across languages. Core metrics include expected maximum toxicity (EMT), fluency, and diversity.

Key Findings:
- Translated data outperforms in-language data for high-resource languages, achieving 38% vs 33% average relative reduction in EMT. Surprisingly, translation preserves sufficient signal for mitigation despite some loss of toxicity.

- Goodtriever consistently surpasses DExperts, especially for mid-resource languages (31% vs 12% relative EMT reduction). It is also less sensitive to language addition order and benefits more from parallel translated content.

- Increasing base model scale from 1.3B to 13B parameters leads to only minor EMT improvements with Goodtriever, suggesting its scalability.

Main Contributions:  
- First comprehensive study of multilingual toxicity mitigation techniques for generative language models.

- Analysis of translated data's viability for mitigation and impact of translation quality.

- Standardized evaluation protocol for comparing toxicity reduction across diverse languages.

- Insights into tradeoffs between finetuning vs retrieval-based approaches in static and continual learning settings.

The work establishes benchmarks and best practices to pave the way for safer and more inclusive language technologies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents the first large-scale study of multilingual toxicity mitigation for language models, evaluating techniques across 9 languages using translated datasets and proposing relative toxicity reduction as a standardized evaluation metric.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting the first large-scale study of multilingual toxicity mitigation for language models. Specifically, the paper:

- Explores the viability of using translated data for toxicity mitigation in multiple languages, despite potential inaccuracies in translation tools. It finds that models trained on translated data can outperform ones trained on smaller in-language datasets.

- Compares finetuning (DExperts) and retrieval-based (Goodtriever) approaches to mitigation, finding that Goodtriever more consistently reduces toxicity, especially for mid-resource languages. 

- Evaluates mitigation techniques in both static and continual learning settings across 9 diverse languages to study the impact of factors like language ordering and parallel vs non-parallel translations.

- Discusses challenges in consistently evaluating and comparing toxicity across languages, and proposes using relative toxicity reduction to enable cross-lingual comparisons.

Overall, the work provides extensive analysis to understand how conventional toxicity mitigation can be expanded to multilingual contexts, while also establishing benchmarks and highlighting open issues to guide future research in this important area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multilingual toxicity mitigation - The paper focuses on expanding toxicity mitigation techniques to multiple languages, rather than just English. This includes evaluating performance across 9 languages from 5 different language families.

- Translation - The use and impact of translated data for toxicity mitigation is a major focus, including comparing in-language vs translated data and the effect of translation quality.

- Evaluation - The paper examines challenges and complexities in evaluating toxicity consistently across diverse languages, and proposes using relative toxicity reduction to enable comparison.

- Methods - Two main methods are compared: Goodtriever (a retrieval-based approach) and DExperts (a finetuning-based approach). Their effectiveness and differences are analyzed. 

- Continual learning - The paper looks at toxicity mitigation in both a static setting and a continual learning setting where languages are added incrementally.

- Ablation studies - Several ablation studies are performed to understand factors like language ordering, parallel vs non-parallel translated data, and model scaling.

- Language diversity - The languages studied span 5 different scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, Hangul) and include high resource and mid resource languages.

In summary, the key focus is on multilingual toxicity mitigation and the challenges of evaluation, with significant analysis around translation and continual learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes using translated text for multilingual toxicity mitigation. What are some potential downsides or limitations of relying on translated text instead of native text in multiple languages? How might translation quality impact the effectiveness of mitigation?

2. The paper compares a retrieval-based approach (Goodtriever) and a finetuning-based approach (DExperts) for multilingual toxicity mitigation. What are the key differences between these two approaches and what are the relative tradeoffs? Under what conditions might one approach be favored over the other?  

3. The concept of "continual learning" is introduced in the paper to understand how languages interact over time as models evolve. How might the ordering of languages during continual learning impact cross-lingual effects in toxicity mitigation? What differences were observed between the two mitigation approaches in this setting?

4. The paper acknowledges challenges in evaluating and comparing toxicity accurately across diverse languages. What specifically makes this difficult? How might the use of template-based evaluation sets address some of these challenges? What limitations still remain in the benchmark proposed?

5. What effects were observed from using parallel versus non-parallel translated text for toxicity mitigation in the continual learning setting? Why might the finetuning and retrieval-based approaches exhibit differences in how they leverage parallel/non-parallel data?  

6. The base model size was scaled up 10x in one experiment. How did the mitigation performance compare between the 1.3B and 13B model with Goodtriever? Was there an impact from increasing the datastore size with the 13B base model?

7. What differences were observed in PerspectiveAPI toxicity scores when translating the same sentences between languages? What might explain some languages scoring as more/less toxic? How does this complicate cross-lingual toxicity evaluations?

8. What correlations were observed between translation quality of datasets and subsequent toxicity mitigation performance? Were there differences across languages studied in terms of this relationship?

9. The native Portuguese dataset was studied in detail w.r.t dataset scale. How did metrics like expected toxicity, perplexity and diversity evolve in this controlled setting as more toxic or non-toxic data was added? 

10. The paper studied 9 languages spanning 5 different scripts. What motivated the choice of languages and how might support for additional languages be incorporated in future work? What other techniques could facilitate expanding to many more languages?
