# [Online Learning of Human Constraints from Feedback in Shared Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper addresses the challenge of real-time human-robot collaboration, where different human operators have diverse physical capabilities and constraints. Existing methods typically focus on learning safety constraints or dividing subtasks between agents, but do not consider adapting to different human behaviors and limitations in a shared autonomy setup. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an adaptive agent that learns a "human constraint model" from real-time human feedback during physical collaboration. This allows the agent to adapt its policy online to align with the ergonomic preferences and limitations of the human operator. Specifically:

- They formulate the problem as a Markov game with separate human and robot action spaces, subject to physical constraints. The human policy optimizes their constraints while accounting for robot constraints.

- They introduce the concept of a "trust region" - a feasible joint action space defined by the robot's physical constraints as the upper bound and learned human constraints as the lower bound.

- Human feedback (forces/torques) are used as labels to learn the boundary of this trust region. A constraint model predicts this boundary based on actions and feedback.

- The agent's policy maximizes the collaborative reward while satisfying the trust region constraints.

Main Contributions:

- Novel formulation for online adaptation in shared autonomy setup based on learned human constraints

- Concept of trust region for compatible human-robot joint action space

- Use of real-time physical human feedback to learn bounds of trust region and adapt agent's policy

- Demonstration of variation in human constraints and feedback across individuals

The proposed approach allows assistive robots to dynamically adapt to and augment different human collaborators by detecting their constraints and limitations.
