# [Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering: A New Benchmark for Evaluating   the Generalizability of Video Question Answering Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop video question answering models that can better generalize to rare and unseen answers? 

The key hypothesis is that current video QA models are biased towards frequent answers seen during training, and fail to generalize to rare or unseen answers. To address this, the authors propose a new benchmark called Open-Vocabulary Video QA (OVQA) to specifically measure performance on rare and unseen answers. They also propose a graph neural network based "soft verbalizer" method to help models better adapt to rare and unseen answers.

In summary, the main goal of the paper is to develop video QA models that are less biased and can better handle the long tail of infrequent answers, as well as completely unseen answers. The OVQA benchmark and soft verbalizer method are proposed as ways to both measure and improve model generalization in this area.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new benchmark and method for open-vocabulary video question answering. The main contributions are:

- Introducing a new benchmark called Open-Vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA) to evaluate models on their ability to answer questions with rare or unseen answers. This tests generalization beyond just frequent answers.

- Proposing a GNN-based soft verbalizer to smooth answer embeddings by aggregating information from similar words. This helps improve performance on rare and unseen answers. 

- Developing new baselines by modifying existing open-ended VQA models to handle out-of-vocabulary answers. Experiments show consistently improved performance by handling rare/unseen answers.

- Extensive ablation studies and analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed GNN-based soft verbalizer in improving generalization and handling long-tail distributions of answers.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a new benchmark and method to assess and improve the generalization capability of open-ended video QA models to rare and unseen answers, beyond just frequent ones. The GNN-based soft verbalizer is shown to be an effective technique for this.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of open-vocabulary video question answering:

- It introduces a new benchmark called OVQA (Open-Vocabulary Video Question Answering) that aims to evaluate models on their ability to handle rare and unseen answers. This is novel compared to most prior work that focuses only on frequent/seen answers.

- It proposes a GNN-based soft verbalizer to improve handling of rare/unseen answers. Using graph networks and learnable embeddings for smoothing is a unique technique not seen in other video QA papers. 

- It adapts several existing video QA models into strong OVQA baselines by adding an answer encoder, allowing handling of open vocabularies. Prior works did not modify models this way.

- It provides extensive experiments on multiple datasets to analyze model performance on the different answer categories (frequent, rare, unseen). Most papers evaluate only on overall accuracy.

- The benchmark and analysis seem to indicate models still struggle with rare/unseen answers. So this paper highlights an important remaining challenge in the field.

In summary, this paper makes novel contributions around the problem formulation, model design, evaluation protocol, and analysis. The results reveal open issues around out-of-vocabulary generalization that have not received much focus in prior video QA research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing open-vocabulary video question answering (OVQA) models that can better handle rare and unseen answers. The authors propose the OVQA benchmark to measure generalizability on these types of answers, but there is still room for improvement in model performance.

- Exploring other methods beyond the proposed GNN-based soft verbalizer to improve generalization on rare and unseen answers. The verbalizer helps, but other techniques could further reduce bias towards frequent answers.

- Applying open-vocabulary techniques to other video understanding tasks beyond question answering, such as video captioning, action recognition, etc. The authors focus on QA but the ideas could extend more broadly.

- Evaluating how well open-vocabulary models transfer or adapt to new datasets and distributions. The robustness and few-shot capabilities on novel data could be investigated.

- Developing open-vocabulary models that can generate free-form answers rather than select from a fixed vocabulary. Moving beyond the restricted answer vocabulary remains an open challenge.

- Combining open-vocabulary video QA with multimodal knowledge graphs or other external knowledge to better handle rare concepts. External information sources could aid generalization.

- Creating larger-scale open-vocabulary video QA datasets to train and evaluate stronger models for rare/unseen answers. The existing benchmarks are still fairly small.

In summary, the key directions are improving generalization to rare and unseen answers, reducing bias in current models, extending open-vocabulary techniques to other video tasks, evaluating robustness on new data, integrating external knowledge, and building larger open-vocabulary video QA datasets. Advancing open-vocabulary video understanding appears to be the overarching research theme.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA) to evaluate the generalizability of video question answering models by considering rare and unseen answers. The authors categorize answers into base, common, rare, and unseen groups based on frequency and introduce additional evaluation metrics like mean accuracy to assess performance on rare answers. They modify existing open-ended VQA models by adding an answer encoder to handle unseen answers. To further improve generalization, they propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) based soft verbalizer that smooths answer embeddings by aggregating information from similar words in an external knowledge base. Experiments on four VQA datasets show their modified models effectively handle rare and unseen answers compared to closed-vocabulary baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate their GNN-based soft verbalizer further alleviates bias towards frequent answers and improves performance, especially on rare and unseen answers. Overall, the proposed OVQA benchmark and GNN-based smoothing approach help assess and improve model generalizability in open-ended VQA.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new benchmark called Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA) for evaluating the generalizability of video question answering models. Previous open-ended video QA models formulate the task as a classification problem over a fixed set of frequent answers from the training set. This leads to a bias towards predicting only frequent answers and failure to generalize to rare or unseen answers. OVQA aims to assess model performance on four answer categories - base, common, rare, and unseen. The paper also introduces a novel graph neural network (GNN) based soft verbalizer to smooth answer embeddings and enhance prediction on rare and unseen answers. The GNN aggregates information from the neighborhood words of each answer in a knowledge graph. 

Experiments are conducted on four open-ended video QA datasets - MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, TGIF-QA, and ActivityNet-QA. The paper develops OVQA baselines by modifying existing models with an additional answer encoder. Results show the OVQA baselines effectively improve performance on rare and unseen answers. Ablation studies demonstrate the GNN-based soft verbalizer further enhances generalization, especially for rare and unseen answers, by reducing bias towards frequent answers. Qualitative analyses also illustrate the ability of the model to predict unseen answers. The new benchmark OVQA provides a means to assess the generalizability of video QA models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA), a new benchmark to evaluate the generalizability of video QA models on rare and unseen answers. The key method is a graph neural network (GNN)-based soft verbalizer that smooths original answer embeddings by aggregating information from similar words in an external knowledge base. Specifically, an answer graph is constructed from the external knowledge base, connecting original answers to their nearest neighborhood words. A GNN is applied on this graph to learn to smooth answer embeddings by message passing during training. The learned smoothing function is then applied at test time to enhance predictions for rare and unseen answers. To evaluate, the authors introduce new baselines by modifying existing open-ended video QA models to handle out-of-vocabulary answers. Experiments show consistent improvements on rare and unseen answers using the proposed benchmark and GNN-based soft verbalizer. The method is shown to be broadly applicable across various backbone models and reduces bias towards frequent answers.
