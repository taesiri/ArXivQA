# [You'll Never Walk Alone: A Sketch and Text Duet for Fine-Grained Image   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sketches and text are commonly used modalities for image retrieval. Sketches capture fine-grained visual details useful for fine-grained retrieval while text describes qualitative attributes like color. 
- Prior works have studied sketch, text or combined sketch+text mainly for category-level retrieval. Their synergy is more pronounced for fine-grained retrieval but collecting fine-grained sketch-text pairs is challenging.
- Existing sketch+text methods rely on expensive paired training data or two-stage approaches for composed image retrieval.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel framework for Sketch-Based Composed Image Retrieval (SBCIR) that harnesses the vision-language embedding of CLIP without needing fine-grained sketch-text pairs.
- Convert a sketch into a "pseudo-word token" using a visual-to-word converter and CLIP's text encoder. Append user-provided text query to form composed retrieval query.
- Introduce compositionality constraint using sketch/photo difference signal and neutral text to imitate missing text during training.
- Employ region-aware triplet loss and generator guidance for fine-grained matching.
- Prompt learning method to align learned and English language prompts for better generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Explore fine-grained representation capabilities of both sketch and text for the first time and orchestrate their synergistic interplay for image retrieval.
- Eliminate need for extensive fine-grained textual annotations using proposed compositionality framework and CLIP models.
- Outperform state-of-the-art for fine-grained, scene-level and domain composed retrieval without relying on expensive paired data.
- Enable applications like sketch+text based fine-grained image generation, object-sketch based scene retrieval and domain attribute transfer.
