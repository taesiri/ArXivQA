# [You'll Never Walk Alone: A Sketch and Text Duet for Fine-Grained Image   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sketches and text are commonly used modalities for image retrieval. Sketches capture fine-grained visual details useful for fine-grained retrieval while text describes qualitative attributes like color. 
- Prior works have studied sketch, text or combined sketch+text mainly for category-level retrieval. Their synergy is more pronounced for fine-grained retrieval but collecting fine-grained sketch-text pairs is challenging.
- Existing sketch+text methods rely on expensive paired training data or two-stage approaches for composed image retrieval.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel framework for Sketch-Based Composed Image Retrieval (SBCIR) that harnesses the vision-language embedding of CLIP without needing fine-grained sketch-text pairs.
- Convert a sketch into a "pseudo-word token" using a visual-to-word converter and CLIP's text encoder. Append user-provided text query to form composed retrieval query.
- Introduce compositionality constraint using sketch/photo difference signal and neutral text to imitate missing text during training.
- Employ region-aware triplet loss and generator guidance for fine-grained matching.
- Prompt learning method to align learned and English language prompts for better generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Explore fine-grained representation capabilities of both sketch and text for the first time and orchestrate their synergistic interplay for image retrieval.
- Eliminate need for extensive fine-grained textual annotations using proposed compositionality framework and CLIP models.
- Outperform state-of-the-art for fine-grained, scene-level and domain composed retrieval without relying on expensive paired data.
- Enable applications like sketch+text based fine-grained image generation, object-sketch based scene retrieval and domain attribute transfer.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel framework for fine-grained image retrieval that combines freehand sketches and textual descriptions in a complementary way, eliminating the need for extensive fine-grained sketch-text pairing through compositionality constraints and neutral text regularizers while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for fine-grained image retrieval that leverages the synergy between freehand sketches and textual descriptions. Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a compositionality framework that effectively combines sketches and text using pre-trained CLIP models, eliminating the need for extensive fine-grained textual descriptions during training. This is done by representing the sketch as a "pseudo-word token" that captures its semantics, and combining it with optional text queries during inference.

2) The framework enables precise image retrievals that go beyond traditional category-level distinctions by harmonizing the structural information from sketches and contextual/attribute information from text.

3) The system unlocks novel applications like sketch+text based fine-grained image generation, object-sketch based scene retrieval, and domain attribute transfer.

In summary, the main contribution is exploring the fine-grained representation capabilities of both sketches and text for image retrieval, and orchestrating their synergistic interplay through a novel compositionality framework built using CLIP. This eliminates the previous reliance on sketches alone and expensive paired annotations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Fine-grained image retrieval - The paper focuses on retrieving specific, detailed images rather than broad image categories.

- Sketch and text modalities - The paper explores using both sketch inputs and text descriptions to compose fine-grained queries. 

- Compositionality framework - A key contribution is a framework to combine sketch and text queries in a complementary way.

- Pseudo-word tokens - Sketches are represented as pseudo-word tokens that emulate visual concepts in the text embedding space.

- Textual inversion - The idea of inverting images into text representations is used as inspiration.

- Pre-trained CLIP model - The Compositionality framework leverages CLIP's vision and language encoders.

- Region-aware triplet loss - A loss used to enforce fine-grained matching between composed query and target photo features. 

- Neutral text set - Used to regularize training and preserve grammatical structure.

- Downstream applications - Scene image retrieval, attribute transfer, fine-grained image generation are shown.

In summary, key terms revolve around sketch, text, and image compositionality for fine-grained retrieval, enabled by pre-trained CLIP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel compositionality framework to combine sketches and text for fine-grained image retrieval. Can you explain in more detail how this framework works and how it handles the compositionality of sketch and text queries? 

2. One of the key ideas is to represent the sketch as a "pseudo-word token" that emulates its visual concept in an equivalent word embedding space. What is the intuition behind this and how does converting the sketch to a pseudo-word enable better compositionality with text?

3. The paper proposes a "compositionality constraint" enforced via a sketch-photo difference signal to imitate missing textual descriptions during training. Can you elaborate on why this constraint is important and how it helps in learning the compositionality?

4. Explain the role of the "neutral text" and how it helps regularize the training to preserve the grammatical structure of the input text space of CLIP's text encoder.

5. How does the proposed method achieve fine-grained matching between the composed query and the target photo? Explain the working of the region-aware triplet loss and the auxiliary generator guidance. 

6. The text-to-text generalization loss enforces the learned prompts to be similar to handcrafted language prompts. Why is this useful and how does it improve generalization capability?

7. During inference, how does the framework combine the pseudo-word token, learned prompts, and optional user-provided text query to form the final composed query for retrieval?

8. The paper shows applications in fine-grained image generation, object sketch based scene retrieval etc. Pick one application and explain how the proposed compositionality framework enables it.  

9. What modifications would be needed to adapt the framework for other cross-modal retrieval tasks like sketch-based video retrieval? Identify any new challenges.

10. The framework is unsupervised in the sense that it does not need paired sketch-text descriptions. Do you think collecting some paired data can further improve performance? Why or why not?
