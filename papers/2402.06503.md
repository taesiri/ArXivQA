# [ACTER: Diverse and Actionable Counterfactual Sequences for Explaining   and Diagnosing RL Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06503)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) models are opaque and their failures are difficult to understand and explain, limiting their use in high-stake applications. 
- Current approaches explain failures by identifying state features responsible but don't offer actionable advice on how the failure could have been prevented.
- Counterfactual state explanations only consider state features and don't show how those features can be changed using RL actions. They are not actionable.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ACTER, an approach to generate actionable and diverse counterfactual sequences that can prevent failure in RL. 
- It defines 5 desired properties for counterfactual sequences: validity, proximity, sparsity, stochastic uncertainty and recency.
- An evolutionary algorithm is used to find optimal and diverse counterfactual sequences that optimize these properties.

Main Contributions:
- Definition of properties that make a counterfactual sequence useful for diagnosing and correcting failures.
- ACTER algorithm to generate actionable and diverse counterfactual sequences in RL.
- Introduction of 3 metrics to quantify diversity of counterfactual sequences.
- Evaluation showing ACTER generates more robust and diverse counterfactuals compared to baselines.
- User study exploring effect of counterfactual vs non-actionable explanations on identifying and correcting failure.

The key insight is that actionability is crucial for counterfactual explanations in RL. By searching the space of past actions instead of state features, ACTER generates sequences that provide advice on how failure could have been concretely prevented. The evolutionary approach also allows generating multiple diverse sequences suited for different user preferences.
