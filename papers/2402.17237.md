# [Image-Text Matching with Multi-View Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing two-stream models for image-text matching show good performance for retrieval speed but sub-optimal accuracy. This is due to two issues: 1) Using a single representation to encode image/text makes it difficult to fully cover complex content needed for retrieval; 2) Lack of cross-modal interaction leads to poor content representation ability and important information being ignored during matching.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Multi-View Attention Model (MVAM) to enhance two-stream models' representation ability. The key ideas are:

1) Learn multiple image/text representations by diverse attention heads instead of a single representation. This allows encoding images/texts from different "views" to cover more content.  

2) Concatenate the multi-view representations into one final representation for retrieval. This aggregates more comprehensive information.

3) Use a diversity loss to promote diversity between attention heads. This helps discover different aspects of images/texts.

MVAM can connect with any two-stream model. At inference time, it retains the efficiency of two-stream models.

Main Contributions:
1) A novel MVAM method that utilizes multi-view attention to encode more comprehensive image/text representations in two-stream models. This boosts matching performance.

2) Introduction of a diversity loss to help learn diverse representations from multiple views of images/texts.

3) Comprehensive experiments showing MVAM substantially improves over existing two-stream models on MSCOCO and Flickr30K datasets. Detailed analysis provides insights into multi-view representations.

In summary, the paper addresses representation limitations in two-stream matching models via a multi-view attention approach. By encoding images/texts from diverse aspects, MVAM enables modeling more complex content for better cross-modal matching.
