# [The Devil is in the Data: Learning Fair Graph Neural Networks via   Partial Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17373)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FairGKD, a novel method to learn fair graph neural networks (GNNs) without requiring access to sensitive demographic attributes. Motivated by the observation that training GNNs on partial data (only node attributes or only topology) improves fairness but sacrifices utility, FairGKD employs partial data training strategies to construct a synthetic teacher model that distills fair and informative knowledge to guide the training of the GNN student. Specifically, the synthetic teacher comprises fairness experts trained on partial data and a projector that combines their outputs, aimed at mitigating higher-level biases in the data. To balance fairness and utility, FairGKD uses an adaptive optimization algorithm. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FairGKD significantly outperforms existing methods in improving fairness while maintaining utility, without needing sensitive attributes. Notably, FairGKD improves fairness for multiple sensitive attributes in one training session. The effectiveness and demographic-agnostic nature of FairGKD highlight its practical utility for learning fair GNNs under restrictions on accessing sensitive attributes.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the novel problem of learning fair graph neural networks (GNNs) without requiring access to sensitive demographic attributes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore fairness without demographics on graph-structured data.

2. Proposing FairGKD, a simple yet effective method to learn fair GNNs by guiding the training process with a synthetic teacher model that distills fair knowledge. The synthetic teacher mitigates higher-level biases using partial data training on only node attributes or graph topology. 

3. Conducting experiments on several real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGKD in improving GNN fairness significantly while maintaining utility, even without access to sensitive attributes. The method also works well across different GNN architectures and for multiple sensitive attributes using just a single training run.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing the novel fairness problem, the FairGKD method to address it, and empirical verification of the approach.

The paper proposes a method called "FairGKD" to learn fair graph neural networks via partial knowledge distillation. The goal is to improve the fairness of GNNs without requiring access to sensitive demographic attributes, by mitigating higher-level biases in the training data through techniques like using only partial graph data (nodes or topology only) to train teacher models. Key elements of the method include constructing a synthetic teacher model to distill fair and informative knowledge to the GNN student model, and using an adaptive optimization algorithm to balance fairness and utility. So the core focus is on improving demographic-agnostic fairness of GNNs through novel use of knowledge distillation and biased data handling paradigms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes mitigating higher-level biases by using partial data training to improve model fairness. What are the key differences between higher-level biases and group-level biases? What role does partial data training play in mitigating these biases?

2. The synthetic teacher model consists of two fairness experts and a projector. Explain the purpose and functionality of each component and how they collectively enable the teacher to provide fair and informative knowledge.  

3. Contrastive learning is utilized to train the projector model within the teacher. Explain the intuition behind using contrastive learning here and how the proof in Theorem 1 supports that it helps produce informative representations.

4. The student model is trained using both hard loss and soft loss terms, balanced via an adaptive optimization algorithm. Explain how this algorithm determines the weighting of the loss terms and why adaptively balancing them is important.

5. One claim of the method is that it can improve fairness for multiple sensitive attributes in a single training run. Explain the reasoning behind why this should be the case. How is it avoiding tailoring to a specific sensitive attribute?

6. In the ablation studies, which components of the framework were found to be most critical for strong fairness improvements? How do the roles of different components compare?

7. The method does not assume access to sensitive attributes. Compare the limitations this creates relative to previous fair graph learning methods that utilize sensitive attributes. What unique capabilities does the method have?  

8. Analyze the time and space complexity of FairGKD. What are the computational bottlenecks and how could the efficiency be further improved?

9. The experiments evaluate performance over different model backbones and datasets. Analyze the results - in what contexts does FairGKD exhibit strengths and weaknesses in improving fairness?

10. The paper focuses on node classification tasks. Discuss how you might extend FairGKD to other graph learning scenarios such as link prediction or graph-level tasks. What methodology adaptations would need to be made?
