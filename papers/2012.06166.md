# [Few-Shot Segmentation Without Meta-Learning: A Good Transductive   Inference Is All You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06166)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:Can we achieve competitive few-shot segmentation performance without relying on meta-learning paradigms if we design an effective transductive inference procedure?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The way inference is performed has a substantial impact on few-shot segmentation performance, beyond the choice of training procedure. This aspect has been overlooked in prior work that focused on meta-learning.2) A properly designed transductive inference procedure that leverages statistics of both labeled support pixels and unlabeled query pixels can boost performance even with a base feature extractor trained with just standard cross-entropy loss.3) The proposed transductive inference method called RePRI can achieve competitive or superior results to meta-learning approaches on few-shot segmentation benchmarks, especially when more support shots are available.4) The performance gaps of meta-learning techniques in more challenging evaluation settings (e.g. domain shift, varying numbers of shots) suggest limitations of current few-shot segmentation benchmarks and a need to re-evaluate the dominance of meta-learning paradigms.In summary, the key question is whether competitive few-shot segmentation is possible without meta-learning if the right transductive inference approach is used, which the authors aim to demonstrate through the proposed RePRI method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new transductive inference approach called RePRI (Region Proportion Regularized Inference) for few-shot segmentation. The key ideas are:- They forego meta-learning and use a simple cross-entropy loss to train the feature extractor on base classes. - At inference time, they optimize a linear classifier for each task by minimizing a loss with 3 terms:     1) Cross-entropy on labeled support pixels    2) Entropy of predictions on query image pixels     3) KL divergence between predicted foreground proportion and estimated proportion- The KL divergence term acts as a regularizer to prevent degenerate solutions and helps leverage unlabeled query image pixels.- Without any meta-learning, just using the proposed transductive inference yields competitive results on 1-shot segmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art significantly on 5-shot segmentation.- They also show the potential of using region proportion information to further improve performance.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new transductive inference approach that effectively leverages unlabeled query pixels to achieve strong few-shot segmentation performance without needing complex meta-learning. The results suggest re-thinking the relevance of meta-learning for this task.
