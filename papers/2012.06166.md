# [Few-Shot Segmentation Without Meta-Learning: A Good Transductive   Inference Is All You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06166)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:Can we achieve competitive few-shot segmentation performance without relying on meta-learning paradigms if we design an effective transductive inference procedure?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The way inference is performed has a substantial impact on few-shot segmentation performance, beyond the choice of training procedure. This aspect has been overlooked in prior work that focused on meta-learning.2) A properly designed transductive inference procedure that leverages statistics of both labeled support pixels and unlabeled query pixels can boost performance even with a base feature extractor trained with just standard cross-entropy loss.3) The proposed transductive inference method called RePRI can achieve competitive or superior results to meta-learning approaches on few-shot segmentation benchmarks, especially when more support shots are available.4) The performance gaps of meta-learning techniques in more challenging evaluation settings (e.g. domain shift, varying numbers of shots) suggest limitations of current few-shot segmentation benchmarks and a need to re-evaluate the dominance of meta-learning paradigms.In summary, the key question is whether competitive few-shot segmentation is possible without meta-learning if the right transductive inference approach is used, which the authors aim to demonstrate through the proposed RePRI method.
