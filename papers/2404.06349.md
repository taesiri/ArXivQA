# [CausalBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Causal Learning Capability of   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) for causal learning capabilities are narrow, using small datasets (<=20 nodes) and basic tasks like identifying pairwise causal relationships. 
- Prompts used are limited to variable names, not utilizing LLMs' abilities in long-text comprehension and integrating prior knowledge.  
- Only a few LLMs evaluated, limiting generalizability of assessments.

Proposed Solution:
- Comprehensive benchmark "CausalBench" created to evaluate causality identification capabilities of LLMs.
- Incorporates 15 real-world causal learning datasets with 2-109 nodes to test upper limits of LLM capabilities across scales.
- Has 3 core tasks - identify correlation, causal skeleton, causality - to assess understanding of relationships at different difficulties.
- 4 prompt formats used - variable names, + background knowledge, + structured data, + both - to leverage LLMs' knowledge integration. 
- 19 leading LLMs evaluated, including open-source BERT, LLAMA, OPT, Falcon, InternLM and closed-source GPT variants.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive benchmark for evaluating causal learning abilities of LLMs using diverse datasets, tasks and prompts.
- Tests upper limits of LLM capabilities across datasets with up to 109 nodes.
- Uncovers strengths/weaknesses of different LLMs - closed-source LLMs significantly better but still below human performance.
- Quantifies differences in handling textual v/s data information, adapting to network structures, utilizing background knowledge.
- Lays foundation for developing LLMs' causal understanding - key for explainability, adaptability and counterfactual generation.

In summary, the paper proposes a robust benchmark "CausalBench" to thoroughly evaluate the causal learning capacities of LLMs using diverse datasets, tasks and prompts. The benchmark provides significant insights into current capabilities and limitations of even the most advanced LLMs in understanding causality. The findings pave the way for developing LLMs optimized for causal reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark, CausalBench, to evaluate the causality identification capabilities of large language models across diverse datasets, tasks, and prompt formats, revealing strengths and weaknesses of current models compared to humans and traditional causal learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CausalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the causal learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Key aspects of CausalBench include:

1) Incorporating diverse real-world datasets from the causal learning research community, ranging from 2 to 109 nodes, to enable thorough assessment of LLMs across varying scales and complexities. 

2) Establishing three core evaluation tasks - identifying correlation, causal skeleton, and causality - to test LLMs' capabilities in understanding causal relationships at different depths.

3) Introducing four distinct prompt formats - variable names, variable names with background knowledge, variable names with structured data, and a combination - to fully utilize LLMs' abilities in long-text comprehension and integrating prior information.

4) Evaluating the performance of 19 leading LLMs using CausalBench to uncover their strengths, weaknesses and upper limits in causal understanding across diverse datasets, tasks, and information sources. 

5) Providing insights into enhancing LLMs for causal learning via specialized pre-training objectives, auxiliary inputs like causal graphs, and improved integration of background knowledge and structured data.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of CausalBench as a comprehensive, multi-faceted benchmark tailored specifically for evaluating causal learning capabilities of LLMs.
