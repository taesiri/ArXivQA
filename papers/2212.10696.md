# [Analyzing Semantic Faithfulness of Language Models via Input   Intervention on Conversational Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10696)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How semantically faithful are popular transformer-based language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet? In particular, do these models accurately capture the semantic content of texts when making inferences and answering questions?

The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:

1) These models are not semantically faithful - they fail to accurately track semantic content and make invalid inferences when answering questions about texts after certain interventions are made, such as deleting or negating key semantic content.

2) Simple intervention-based training can help mitigate lack of semantic faithfulness in some cases, such as making models more sensitive to deletion of rationale text. 

3) But this training does not fully resolve semantic unfaithfulness, as models still struggle with other aspects like handling negation and capturing predicate-argument structure.

So in summary, the central research question is assessing semantic faithfulness of transformer models, with hypotheses about their deficiencies in this area and potential remedies via intervention-based training. The notion of semantic faithfulness and the proposed interventions are the key elements being examined.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper formalizes a notion of "semantic faithfulness" for evaluating how well language models capture the semantic content of texts. 

2. The authors perform experiments using two novel semantic interventions - deletion and negation - on popular transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet. They show these models fail to be semantically faithful, often predicting the same answers even after key content is deleted or negated.

3. The paper proposes an intervention-based training strategy that helps mitigate the effect of deletion interventions. Analysis shows this makes the contextual embeddings more sensitive to the deleted rationale text.

4. Further experiments demonstrate the models' limitations in handling negation interventions and capturing predicate-argument structure. Even large models exhibit lack of semantic faithfulness.

5. The authors test semantic faithfulness of InstructGPT models via prompting. These models also fail on deletion and negation interventions. For predicate-argument structure, InstructGPT does very well but shows some inconsistencies. 

In summary, the key contribution is introducing semantic faithfulness as an evaluation criteria, and demonstrating via interventions that current transformer models lack semantic faithfulness, indicating they do not properly exploit semantic content and structure for reasoning. The paper provides analysis and training strategies to improve faithfulness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on analyzing semantic faithfulness of language models:

- The paper introduces two novel intervention methods - deletion intervention and negation intervention - for testing semantic faithfulness. These allow targeted probing of whether models are truly relying on semantic content for inference. This is a new approach compared to prior work. 

- The paper tests major pretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet across different sizes. Most prior work has focused on evaluating one or two models. Looking at multiple models allows for more robust conclusions.

- The paper finds these major models lack semantic faithfulness in a variety of ways, like failing the interventions and handling predicate-argument structure. This contrasts with the common wisdom that bigger pretrained models capture more semantic information.

- The paper proposes intervention-based training to improve robustness to deletion intervention. This demonstrates one way training can be adapted to enforce stronger reliance on semantic content. Most prior work has focused just on analyzing models rather than improving them.

- The paper analyzes model internals like attention and embeddings to understand why intervention-based training helps. This provides insight into the model behavior changes.

- The paper evaluates the InstructGPT model using prompting. This connects the analysis to recent work on prompting methods for large language models.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in rigorously testing semantic faithfulness, finding limitations in major models, proposing tailored training, and analyzing model internals. The experiments are thorough and the results highlight important areas for future improvement. The interventions introduced provide a valuable new tool for analyzing language model semantics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more sophisticated content intervention strategies beyond deletion and negation to further analyze model behavior. The authors point out that while intervention-based training helps for deletion, it doesn't generalize well to other scenarios like negation.

- Better understanding and improving models' ability to capture predicate argument structure. The authors show issues with models capturing basic predicate-argument relationships and inconsistencies in handling semantically equivalent questions. They suggest enhancing knowledge of predicate-argument structure in transformer models.

- Creating more negation intervention examples for fine-tuning. The authors note it is difficult to generate enough negated examples while preserving coherence and style. Automating this process is posed as a challenge.

- Analyzing model instability and random behavior in certain cases related to predicate-argument structure and logical inferences. The authors plan to address why models behave erratically for some semantically equivalent questions.

- Integrating semantic structure fully into transformer models without sacrificing inferential power. The authors believe this is key to solving the overall problem of semantic unfaithfulness.

- Extending the notion of semantic faithfulness beyond question answering to things like logical formalisms and code generation, to test inference abilities more broadly.

In summary, the main suggestions involve developing more sophisticated interventions, better integrating semantic knowledge into models, collecting more varied counterfactual data, and analyzing model instabilities and failures in logical reasoning. Overall, enhancing semantic faithfulness in models is posed as an important direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the semantic faithfulness of transformer-based language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet by looking at how they perform on question answering tasks after two types of semantic interventions on the input text - deletion of rationale text and negation of key information. Despite strong performance on standard benchmarks, the models fail to respond properly when critical content is removed or negated, predicting the original answers around 50% of the time after deletion and showing a 20% drop in accuracy after negation. The paper proposes an intervention-based training approach that improves model sensitivity to deletion but not negation. Further analysis reveals the models' difficulty in capturing predicate-argument structure and responding consistently to paraphrased questions. Overall, the work demonstrates that current transformer models are not semantically faithful - they do not reliably leverage semantic content for inference - highlighting concerns around their reasoning abilities and reliability. The findings suggest integrating formal semantic structure may be key to improving faithfulness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the semantic faithfulness of popular Transformer-based language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. The authors define semantic faithfulness as a model accurately tracking the semantic content of texts and questions when making inferences and answering questions. They test semantic faithfulness through two novel semantic interventions on texts - deletion intervention which removes rationale text critical for answering a question, and negation intervention which negates the textual support in the story. 

Despite strong performance on standard QA datasets, the models fail to be semantically faithful when tested with these interventions. For deletion intervention, the models wrongly predict answers even after removing rationale text from the story in around 50% of cases. For negation intervention, there is a 20% drop in accuracy when critical text is negated. The paper shows these models rely on superficial cues and don't reason about semantic content. They propose an intervention-based training approach that improves model behavior for deletion intervention. But this training doesn't help for negation intervention or capturing predicate-argument structure. Overall, the paper demonstrates flaws in popular language models regarding semantic faithfulness and argues this is a serious problem for reliably using them.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes two novel semantic interventions - deletion intervention and negation intervention - to analyze the semantic faithfulness of popular transformer-based language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet on the Conversational Question Answering (CoQA) dataset. For deletion intervention, they remove the annotated rationale from the story and test if the models still predict the original answer. For negation intervention, they modify the rationale to flip the answer from yes to no or vice versa. They find that the models wrongly predict the original answers in a significant number of cases after both interventions, indicating they are not semantically faithful. To mitigate this for deletion intervention, they propose a simple intervention-based training strategy. This involves training the models to predict unknown when the rationale is removed, while still predicting the original answer when the rationale is present. The intervention-based training makes the models highly sensitive to deletion intervention without hurting performance on the original dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper analyzes the semantic faithfulness of popular transformer-based language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet through interventions that alter the semantic content of texts, finding that these models often fail to update their inferences appropriately when the underlying meaning is changed, indicating a lack of robust semantic reasoning.
