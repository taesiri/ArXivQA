# [Adaptive Surface Normal Constraint for Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Adaptive Surface Normal Constraint for Depth Estimation":

Problem:
Existing methods for monocular depth estimation either lack geometric constraints, leading to poor 3D geometry in the estimated depth maps, or struggle to reliably incorporate geometric context like surface normals, due to difficulty in capturing reliable local geometry especially in areas with shape variations or noise. This leads to a bottleneck in improving depth estimation quality.

Method:
The paper proposes a simple yet effective method to adaptively determine reliable local geometry from neighboring points of a target pixel, to derive a surface normal constraint that correlates well with depth estimation. 

Key ideas:
- For each target pixel, randomly sample multiple sets of point triplets from its neighbors to get normal vector candidates 
- Measure consistency of learned geometric context features between each triplet point and the target, to get confidence scores
- Weighted sum of the normal candidates based on confidence scores and area of triplet gives the final normal vector

The adaptive weighting based on geometric context and area makes the formulation robust to local variations like shape boundaries or noise.

Main Contributions:
- Novel adaptive surface normal (ASN) computation method to derive geometric constraints for depth estimation
- Achieves state-of-the-art depth accuracy since ASN correlates well with estimated depth
- Estimated depth also recovers high quality 3D geometry in terms of surface normals and point cloud 
- Approach is simple, efficient and robust to shape variations like boundaries and noise

The method outperforms previous state-of-the-art on NYU Depth dataset quantitatively and qualitatively for depth accuracy, point cloud quality and recovered surface normals. Ablations and visualizations confirm the efficacy of the adaptive modules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adaptive surface normal constraint for monocular depth estimation that determines reliable local geometry from randomly sampled point triplets and uses a weighted combination to estimate faithful surface normals, achieving improved depth prediction quality and geometric reconstruction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel formulation to derive geometric constraint for depth estimation, called adaptive surface normal (ASN). 

2. The proposed method is simple, fast and effective. It is robust to noises and local variations and able to consistently capture faithful geometry.

3. The method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on public datasets by a large margin in depth estimation, surface normal recovery, and 3D point cloud quality.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed adaptive surface normal constraint that can effectively correlate the depth estimation with geometric consistency in a robust way. This leads to accurate depth prediction and high quality 3D geometry reconstruction from a single image.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Monocular depth estimation - Estimating depth from a single RGB image. This is the main task addressed in the paper.

- Surface normal - The 3D geometry of shapes. Surface normals are used as geometric constraints to improve depth estimation.

- Adaptive surface normal (ASN) constraint - The novel constraint proposed in this paper to correlate the estimated depth with geometric consistency. It adaptively determines reliable local geometry to derive the normals.

- Random sampling - The paper proposes to randomly sample point triplets from the estimated depth map to compute normal candidates.

- Geometric context adaption - One of the key components of the ASN formulation. It determines the confidence of each normal candidate by measuring consistency of contextual features. 

- Area adaption - The other key component of ASN. It weighs each normal candidate by the area of its corresponding triangle.

- Guidance features - Latent features learned by the network to capture geometric context and variations, which enables the geometric adaption.

In summary, the key focus is using an adaptive surface normal formulation to enforce geometry consistency for improving monocular depth estimation. The main concepts involve normal sampling, confidence measurement, and adaption strategies.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Adaptive Surface Normal (ASN) formulation help address the key issue of determining reliable local geometry to support normal estimation, especially in regions with shape variations? Explain the advantages.

7. Analyze the network architecture used. How do the two decoder streams for depth and guidance features help enforce the ASN constraint? 

8. Explain how the loss function, consisting of depth and normal terms, is designed. What is the motivation behind using a cosine embedding loss for the normal term?  

9. Compare and contrast the ASN formulation qualitatively and quantitatively with other baseline normal constraints like Sobel operators, least squares, and virtual normals.

10. What are some limitations of the current ASN formulation? How can it be improved or extended in future work?
