# [Provable Privacy with Non-Private Pre-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Pre-processing data is a standard practice before applying differentially private (DP) algorithms. Common pre-processing techniques like data imputation, deduplication, quantization and PCA are often applied in a non-private manner prior to DP learning. However, the potential privacy cost of such data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked. This can undermine the overall privacy guarantees of the pipeline. So the paper addresses the important question - what is the price of non-private pre-processing in differentially private data analysis?

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private, data-dependent pre-processing techniques when used with DP algorithms. The analysis relies on two key technical concepts:

1) Smooth Differential Privacy (Smooth DP): A variant of DP that allows comparison of distributions over datasets with bounded L2 distance. This helps in finer-grained privacy analysis compared to group privacy.

2) Sensitivity of pre-processing functions: Used to quantify the impact of a single data point on the output of pre-processing algorithms. 

Using these, the paper shows how to calculate end-to-end privacy guarantees for pipelines involving common pre-processing methods like deduplication, quantization, imputation and PCA combined with DP techniques like Gaussian/Laplace mechanism, Exponential mechanism and DP-SGD.

Additionally, a Propose-Test-Release inspired framework is introduced to provide unconditional privacy guarantees in practice even for pathological datasets.

Main Contributions:

- A general framework to evaluate privacy loss from non-private pre-processing that works with several DP algorithms
- Explicit overall privacy guarantees for combinations of common pre-processing and DP methods  
- Introduction of technical tools like Smooth DP and pre-processing sensitivity to enable tighter analysis
- A practical framework based on Propose-Test-Release for unconditional privacy guarantees

The analysis shows that overall privacy loss is typically minimal for reasonable datasets. The frameworks presented are easy to integrate into existing pipelines.
