# [DVI: Depth Guided Video Inpainting for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08854)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an effective video inpainting method to remove objects and fill in missing regions in videos captured from autonomous vehicles, using the available image and depth data? 

The key points are:

- Video inpainting is useful for creating clean background images for autonomous driving applications, by removing dynamic agents like vehicles and pedestrians. 

- Existing inpainting methods have limitations in handling complex outdoor scenes with perspective changes and long-term occlusions.

- The authors propose using depth data along with images to guide video inpainting, by building 3D maps to establish geometric correlations across frames.

- They introduce techniques like candidate color sampling, belief propagation regularization, color harmonization, and video fusion to generate high quality inpainting results.

- A new dataset is collected to evaluate the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods, and both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of their depth guided video inpainting technique.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that leveraging depth data and 3D geometry can significantly improve video inpainting quality compared to existing image-only methods, especially for autonomous driving scenarios. The experiments validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. A novel approach for depth guided video inpainting for autonomous driving scenarios. The method uses 3D maps built from stitched point clouds to guide the video inpainting process.

2. A technique for fusing multiple videos to solve the problem of long-time occlusion, where a target region is never visible in a single video. The authors claim they are the first to propose fusing multiple videos for inpainting. 

3. A new dataset captured from an autonomous vehicle with synchronized images and LiDAR data, including challenging scenes with long occlusions. 

4. Two components designed for the inpainting pipeline - Candidate Color Sampling Criteria to select the best colors for inpainting, and Color Harmonization to ensure smooth blending.

5. Experimental results showing their method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, especially in terms of reducing the RMSE.

In summary, the key innovations seem to be the depth guided inpainting approach using 3D maps, the multi-video fusion technique, and the new challenging dataset. The method does not rely on deep learning and can run on CPUs, making it easy to deploy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate improved performance over other inpainting methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video inpainting method using depth maps to guide the sampling of color pixels from other frames to fill in missing regions, and introduces video fusion of multiple clips to address long-term occlusions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my understanding, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of video inpainting:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a depth guided video inpainting approach for autonomous driving applications. The main differences compared to prior work are:

- Uses depth/point cloud data along with RGB images to guide the inpainting. Most prior work uses only RGB images/videos. 

- Builds a 3D map by stitching point clouds from all frames. This allows correlating pixels across frames via the map. Other methods use optical flow which can have errors.

- Proposes fusing multiple videos by registering into a common 3D map. This helps handle long-term occlusions not seen in a single video. Novel idea not explored before.

- Avoids deep learning methods so the approach is not constrained by training data domain or needing GPUs. Prior GAN based approaches require relevant training data.

- Evaluated on a new challenging dataset with long-term occlusions. Many existing datasets lack depth information.

Overall, the depth guided approach leveraging 3D geometry appears to be a novel direction for video inpainting. The results demonstrate improved performance over learning-based methods, especially in handling perspective changes. Fusing multiple videos is also a unique capability. The trade-off is requiring depth data along with RGB images.

Compared to propagation or patch-based methods, this work incorporates 3D geometry for better alignments and handling of perspective changes. The regularization using belief propagation is also more robust than simple texture copying.

In summary, the paper introduces useful innovations in video inpainting using multi-modal data, while avoiding limitations of learning-based approaches. The proposed techniques could generalize well to other scenarios with aligned RGB-D videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Using 360 degree panoramic cameras instead of just forward-facing cameras. This could help alleviate occlusion issues by providing more viewpoints. 

- Fusing data from multiple captures of the same scene. This could help fill in areas that are occluded for long periods in a single video capture.

- Improving color harmonization when sampling pixels across different frames and videos. This could help reduce color seam artifacts.

- Exploring other 3D reconstruction methods besides LOAM for building the 3D map. This could improve the density and accuracy of the 3D representations.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider variety of indoor and outdoor scenes with image+depth data. This could help demonstrate the generalization capability.

- Comparing to more recent deep learning based video inpainting methods. As new techniques emerge, benchmarking on them could help situate the performance.

- Optimizing the computational performance and reducing run times. This could help make the approach more practical for real-time usage.

- Exploring combinations with learning-based approaches to fill any small holes left over after depth-guided inpainting. This could provide a way to handle areas never visible.

In summary, the main suggestions are around improving the camera coverage, video fusion capabilities, color harmonization, 3D reconstruction accuracy, benchmarking, performance, and integration with learning-based inpainting. Expanding the approach along these dimensions could yield an even more robust and general video inpainting system.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video inpainting method using depth guidance for autonomous driving scenarios. The approach builds a dense 3D map by stitching lidar point clouds and projects it back onto individual frames to get a dense depth map. With this depth guidance, pixels can be sampled from other frames to fill in target regions for inpainting. The method avoids deep learning so it can run efficiently on CPUs without requiring GPUs or domain-specific training data. A key contribution is fusing multiple videos to solve long-time occlusion problems. The method outperforms prior inpainting techniques, reducing RMSE by 13% on a new challenging urban driving dataset collected by the authors. Overall, the depth-guided approach effectively removes objects from videos and synthesizes missing areas while preserving detailed textures and handling perspective distortion, showing promise for applications like creating clear street views and photorealistic simulations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video inpainting method to remove objects from videos and fill in the missing regions, using depth information to guide the process. The key idea is to build a dense 3D map by stitching together the point clouds from each video frame. This map allows establishing geometric correlations between frames in the video. To inpaint a target region in a frame, pixels can be sampled from other frames and transformed into the current one with correct occlusion handling, thanks to the depth and camera pose information. The paper also introduces a video fusion approach to address long-term occlusions, where a region is never visible in a single video. Multiple videos captured at different times can be registered into a common 3D map, enabling inpainting one video with pixels from the others. 

The depth-guided inpainting approach avoids deep learning methods so it can run efficiently on CPUs and generalize to new scenarios without retraining. The authors introduce candidate color sampling criteria to preserve texture and minimize distortion when transforming pixels between frames. Photometric consistency is enforced through belief propagation regularization and color harmonization. A new urban street dataset with synchronized images and Lidar data is collected to evaluate the method. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, reducing the RMSE metric by 13\% and effectively handling perspective changes and video fusion cases. The work explores a promising direction leveraging depth data to guide video synthesis tasks.

The paper proposes a novel video inpainting method to remove objects from videos and synthesize missing regions using depth guidance. The key steps involve building a dense 3D map by stitching together point clouds from the video frames, projecting this 3D map back onto each frame to get a dense depth map, using the depth map to sample candidate colors from other frames to fill the missing regions, applying belief propagation to regularize the colors, performing color harmonization for seamless blending, and fusing multiple videos to handle long term occlusions.
