# [Clustering and Ranking: Diversity-preserved Instruction Selection   through Expert-aligned Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Instruction tuning (IT) is important for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences, but manually creating high-quality instruction datasets is difficult. 
- Existing IT data selection methods have limitations like relying on external APIs, biases from GPT models, and reduced data diversity.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Clustering and Ranking (CaR), an industrial-friendly method to select high-quality and diverse IT data. 
- CaR has two steps:
   1) Ranking: Score all instruction pairs using a lightweight model (355M parameters) that aligns well with human expert preferences (84.25% accuracy).
   2) Clustering: Group instructions into clusters and select some from each cluster to preserve diversity.
- This produces a subset of highly rated and diverse instructions for IT.

Contributions:
- Introduce Instruction Pair Quality Estimation (IQE) to estimate quality of IT datasets and align with actual LLM performance after IT.
- Propose scoring model that aligns better with human preferences than GPT-4 (21.05% higher accuracy). 
- CaR selection uses only 1.96% of data yet improves on Alpaca by 32.1% when tuning LLaMa, showing the importance of quality and diversity.
- Small models used keep costs low (11.2% of other methods), enabling industrial deployment.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective industrial-friendly approach to evaluate and select high-quality, diverse IT data for efficiently tuning LLMs, outperforming prior methods.
