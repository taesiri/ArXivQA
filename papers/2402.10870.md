# [Best of Three Worlds: Adaptive Experimentation for Digital Marketing in   Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adaptive experimental design (AED) methods are being increasingly used in industry to reduce experimentation cost and increase testing throughput compared to traditional A/B testing. However, the behavior and guarantees of AED methods are not well understood in real-world non-stationary environments.

- The paper presents illustrative case studies using real experiment data that highlight key challenges with using AED methods naively:
  - Regret minimizing algorithms like Thompson Sampling fail to provide valid statistical inferences and are slow to identify the best arm.
  - Running empirical mean is problematic for estimation and inference due to Simpson's paradox.
  - Objectives are not well defined in time-varying settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a "best of three worlds" approach that efficiently identifies the counterfactual optimal treatment, mitigates opportunity cost, and is robust to real-world time variation.

- A new metric called cumulative gain is proposed to measure what reward an arm could have obtained if it received all traffic. An unbiased estimator based on inverse propensity scoring is presented.

- Always-valid sequential confidence intervals enable robust statistical inference.

- An elimination algorithm called CGSE is developed that uniformly splits traffic among active arms and eliminates arms proven suboptimal.

Main Contributions:
- Provides perspective on objectives and requirements for AED systems in industrial settings through real-world case studies and data.

- Develops a cumulative gain metric along with an unbiased estimator and always-valid confidence intervals for statistical inference.

- Proposes the CGSE algorithm for efficient identification of the counterfactual optimal arm with opportunity cost mitigation.

- Demonstrates strong empirical performance of the proposed techniques on real experiments relative to baselines like Thompson Sampling.

- Provides theoretical guarantees for CGSE in terms of identification and regret.

In summary, the paper addresses key practical challenges with using AED methods naively in real-world situations and contributes a robust approach with an efficient algorithm, always-valid inference, and proven guarantees.
