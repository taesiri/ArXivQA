# [Radio Source Localization using Sparse Signal Measurements from Uncrewed   Ground Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03493)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient technique for radio source localization using sparse received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from a mobile robot. The robot follows a trajectory generated using coverage path planning to explore the area quickly. The collected RSSI readings are assigned to map grid cells which are analyzed to identify the cell with the highest average RSSI, indicating the likely source location. The radio propagation model and impact of Fresnel zones are studied for the experimental 2.4 GHz system. Comparisons to interpolation and active sensing methods on 8 field tests showed the proposed technique can localize a radio source to within 1.2 meters accuracy in under 3 minutes. Key benefits include simplicity, speed, and higher accuracy compared to relevant methods. Evaluations also analyze the effect of varying the grid cell size. Overall this presents an effective approach for rapidly localizing arbitrarily-located radio sources in unknown environments using RSSI data from an exploring robot.
