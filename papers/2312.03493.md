# [Radio Source Localization using Sparse Signal Measurements from Uncrewed   Ground Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03493)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient technique for radio source localization using sparse received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from a mobile robot. The robot follows a trajectory generated using coverage path planning to explore the area quickly. The collected RSSI readings are assigned to map grid cells which are analyzed to identify the cell with the highest average RSSI, indicating the likely source location. The radio propagation model and impact of Fresnel zones are studied for the experimental 2.4 GHz system. Comparisons to interpolation and active sensing methods on 8 field tests showed the proposed technique can localize a radio source to within 1.2 meters accuracy in under 3 minutes. Key benefits include simplicity, speed, and higher accuracy compared to relevant methods. Evaluations also analyze the effect of varying the grid cell size. Overall this presents an effective approach for rapidly localizing arbitrarily-located radio sources in unknown environments using RSSI data from an exploring robot.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a fast and computationally efficient radio source localization technique using sparse RSSI measurements collected by a mobile robot traversing a coverage path planning map.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A new radio source localization technique is introduced to achieve a faster turnaround time with low computational complexity. The technique uses RSSI measurements collected while the robot completed a sparse trajectory using a coverage path planning map. It finds the most likely grid cell containing the source by calculating the mean RSSI in each cell.

2. The radio propagation model and Fresnel zone characteristics are analyzed for the experimental setup. 

3. A comparative study was performed, benchmarking two interpolation algorithms (cubic and biharmonic spline).

4. Extensive outdoor experiments were conducted to analyze the radio signal propagation and validate the performance of the proposed technique.

In summary, the key contribution is a fast and low-complexity radio source localization method using sparse RSSI measurements from a mobile robot. This is achieved by leveraging coverage path planning and a simple mean RSSI assignment technique.
