# [LocalRQA: From Generating Data to Locally Training, Testing, and   Deploying Retrieval-Augmented QA Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00982)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Existing toolkits like LlamaIndex and LangChain allow users to quickly assemble retrieval-augmented QA (RQA) systems using off-the-shelf models. However, they provide little support for researchers and developers to customize the model training, testing, and deployment pipelines. This makes it difficult to develop new approaches, evaluate against prior work, and deploy cost-effective models.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes LocalRQA, an open-source Python toolkit for the full pipeline of developing RQA systems. Key features:

- Data Generation: Scripts to create RQA data from documents or convert existing QA datasets.

- Model Training: Various algorithms to train retrievers (e.g. via contrastive learning) and generators (e.g. fusion-in-decoder). Supports many open-source models.

- Pipeline Assembly: Modular design to flexibly combine components. Includes pre-made pipelines for quick start.

- Evaluation: Automatic metrics for retrieval, generation, end-to-end QA performance. Saves results for human evaluation.

- Serving: UIs for interactive chats and static human evaluation. Integrates acceleration libraries for efficiency.

Main Contributions:

1) First toolkit providing wide selection of latest RQA research techniques for training, testing and deployment. Enables developing new approaches.

2) Helps create customized RQA systems that achieve competitive performance to services like OpenAI's API. Lower cost alternative.

3) Showcase building QA systems for Databricks/Faire documentation that reach ~80% human-rated accuracy, on par with GPT-3.5/4 baselines.

In summary, LocalRQA facilitates the full pipeline for RQA research and applications with modern techniques, cost-effective model training, and easy deployment.
