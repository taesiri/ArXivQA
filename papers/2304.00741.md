# [DeGPR: Deep Guided Posterior Regularization for Multi-Class Cell   Detection and Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00741)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we improve the performance of object detection models for multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images, especially in settings with limited training data, tiny overlapping objects, multiple cell types, severe class imbalance, and minute differences between classes?

The key hypothesis is that incorporating domain knowledge and discriminative features between cell types, either from pathologists or learned automatically from data, can guide object detection models to improve their performance on this challenging task. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) that incorporates two types of features - explicit features provided by pathologists and implicit features learned through contrastive pre-training - to regularize the posterior distribution of an object detector to match discriminative patterns in the ground truth data. 

The central hypothesis is that by guiding object detectors in this way, DeGPR will make them more robust for multi-class cell detection and counting compared to using the object detectors alone, especially in settings with limited annotated medical imaging data. Experiments on multiple datasets validate this hypothesis and show consistent gains over baseline detectors.

In summary, the key research question is how to improve multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images by incorporating discriminative features and domain knowledge, and the proposed DeGPR method provides a way to do so through posterior regularization of object detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) for improving multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images. 

2. It introduces two types of features - explicit features provided by experts like pathologists, and implicit features learned automatically using contrastive learning. These features are used to regularize the model via posterior regularization.

3. It contributes a new dataset called MuCeD with annotations for two cell types to aid in diagnosis of celiac disease. 

4. It shows consistent improvements in detection and counting performance of DeGPR over multiple baseline models like YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN and EfficientDet on three datasets - MuCeD, CoNSeP and MoNuSAC.

5. The counting performance of detection based method with DeGPR is shown to be better than prior density based counting techniques that cannot handle multiple cell types.

6. The downstream classification task of predicting celiac disease using cell counts also shows improved accuracy with DeGPR.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel regularization technique DeGPR that incorporates domain knowledge to improve performance of base detection models for multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images. The consistent gains are demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of multi-class cell detection and counting:

- The paper presents a novel approach called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) that improves cell detection by incorporating guidance from pathologists and learning discriminative features between cell classes. This differs from many previous works that rely solely on training deep neural networks on limited datasets. 

- A key contribution is using both explicit features like size and intensity specified by pathologists, as well as learned implicit features from a contrastive encoder. Most prior works focus only on one type of feature. The combination of explicit and implicit features leads to better performance.

- The paper validates DeGPR on three diverse datasets - two public datasets CoNSeP and MoNuSAC, and a new dataset MuCeD for celiac disease diagnosis. Showing consistent gains across datasets demonstrates the approach is robust. In contrast, many papers only report results on a single dataset.

- For evaluation, the paper thoroughly compares detection and counting performance over multiple metrics like mAP, MAE, MRE. It also analyzes the effect on downstream classification tasks using the Q-histology ratio. This is more comprehensive than some papers that look only at detection or counting.

- The paper compares DeGPR augmented detection models against recent density-based counting methods like Count-ception and SAU-Net. It shows counting by detection can outperform these approaches in the multi-class setting.

- Ablation studies demonstrate the individual benefits of explicit features, implicit features, and balanced sampling when training the contrastive encoder. This provides useful analysis for future work.

Overall, the robustness across models, datasets, and tasks, coupled with thorough experimentation and analysis sets this work apart from existing literature in multi-class cell detection and counting. The proposed DeGPR approach appears highly promising based on the results presented.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend their work to other annotation strategies beyond bounding boxes, such as centroids or attention over feature maps. The authors mention that it would be interesting to apply their method in these alternate settings.

- Explore additional explicit features beyond size and intensity that could help discriminate between cell types, such as shape. The authors tried using edge detection to model shape but faced challenges due to noise. Other shape features could be explored.

- Apply their method to other medical diagnosis tasks that require cell detection and counting, beyond celiac disease. The authors show results on two public datasets for colon cancer and multiple organs, indicating the approach may transfer well.

- Improve handling of class imbalance during training, which remains an issue. Strategies like Loss Normalization or re-weighting class importance could help.

- Experiment with more sophisticated density estimators than GMM for modeling the posterior distribution over features. The choice of the estimator may impact results.

- Extend the approach to work in a weakly supervised setting where only image-level labels are available rather than bounding boxes. This could greatly reduce annotation effort.

- Evaluate whether the method could work for cell tracking, segmentation, and classification tasks by building on top of the cell detections.

In summary, the main directions are around applying the method to new settings and tasks, improving class imbalance handling, exploring additional features and density estimators, and reducing supervision. The authors' experiments validate the core ideas on multiple datasets, providing a solid baseline for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) for multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images. DeGPR incorporates guidance from pathologists on discriminative visual features between cell types, as well as learns implicit features via supervised contrastive learning. It fits Gaussian Mixture Models to feature distributions and minimizes their KL divergence between ground truth and predicted boxes. The method is evaluated on two public datasets, CoNSeP and MoNuSAC, and on a new contributed dataset called MuCeD for detecting celiac disease. Experiments over multiple detection model backbones show DeGPR consistently improves performance, obtaining gains such as 3-9% in mAP and 10-35% reduction in counting error. The authors highlight issues like limited data, tiny objects, class imbalance, and subtle inter-class differences, which make medical image cell detection challenging. Overall, DeGPR effectively incorporates human guidance and representation learning to improve multi-class cell detection and counting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a new method called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) for multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images. DeGPR incorporates guidance from pathologists on discriminative features between cell types, as well as learns implicit features in a data-driven manner. It introduces two loss terms that enforce similarity between the distributions of explicit (e.g. size, intensity) and implicit features of the predicted and ground truth cells. DeGPR is model-agnostic and can build on top of any object detector. 

The authors validate DeGPR on two public datasets for colon cancer and multi-organ cell detection, and contribute a new dataset called MuCeD for detecting celiac disease. MuCeD has 8,600 cell annotations across 55 duodenum biopsy images. Experiments over multiple architectures demonstrate consistent improvements from DeGPR across datasets - for example, on MuCeD it obtains 3-9% mAP gain for detection and 10-35% error reduction for counting two cell types. The classification F1-score for predicting celiac disease increases from 77% to 90% with DeGPR. The consistent gains validate the benefit of guiding the model using domain knowledge and learned discriminative features.
