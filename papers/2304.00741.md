# [DeGPR: Deep Guided Posterior Regularization for Multi-Class Cell   Detection and Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00741)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we improve the performance of object detection models for multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images, especially in settings with limited training data, tiny overlapping objects, multiple cell types, severe class imbalance, and minute differences between classes?

The key hypothesis is that incorporating domain knowledge and discriminative features between cell types, either from pathologists or learned automatically from data, can guide object detection models to improve their performance on this challenging task. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) that incorporates two types of features - explicit features provided by pathologists and implicit features learned through contrastive pre-training - to regularize the posterior distribution of an object detector to match discriminative patterns in the ground truth data. 

The central hypothesis is that by guiding object detectors in this way, DeGPR will make them more robust for multi-class cell detection and counting compared to using the object detectors alone, especially in settings with limited annotated medical imaging data. Experiments on multiple datasets validate this hypothesis and show consistent gains over baseline detectors.

In summary, the key research question is how to improve multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images by incorporating discriminative features and domain knowledge, and the proposed DeGPR method provides a way to do so through posterior regularization of object detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework called Deep Guided Posterior Regularization (DeGPR) for improving multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images. 

2. It introduces two types of features - explicit features provided by experts like pathologists, and implicit features learned automatically using contrastive learning. These features are used to regularize the model via posterior regularization.

3. It contributes a new dataset called MuCeD with annotations for two cell types to aid in diagnosis of celiac disease. 

4. It shows consistent improvements in detection and counting performance of DeGPR over multiple baseline models like YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN and EfficientDet on three datasets - MuCeD, CoNSeP and MoNuSAC.

5. The counting performance of detection based method with DeGPR is shown to be better than prior density based counting techniques that cannot handle multiple cell types.

6. The downstream classification task of predicting celiac disease using cell counts also shows improved accuracy with DeGPR.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel regularization technique DeGPR that incorporates domain knowledge to improve performance of base detection models for multi-class cell detection and counting in medical images. The consistent gains are demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models.
