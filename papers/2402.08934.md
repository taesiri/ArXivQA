# [Extreme Video Compression with Pre-trained Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the exponential growth in demand for video data and emerging technologies like AR/VR and metaverse requiring highly compressed video transmission, there is a need for improved video compression methods compared to standard codecs like H.264 and H.265. These traditional methods rely on motion/optical flow estimation and compensation which have limitations. Recent advances in generative AI models present new opportunities for exploiting temporal relations in videos for compression.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel predictive video compression framework combining a neural image codec (ELIC) and a pre-trained conditional diffusion model. Only a subset of frames are compressed using ELIC based on a quality threshold while other frames are generated at the decoder by the diffusion model conditioned on previous frames. This allows achieving ultra low bitrates below 0.02 bpp. A sequential encoding process decides which frames to compress vs generate based on comparing predicted frames with original frames using a distortion metric.

Main Contributions:
- First video compression scheme exploiting predictive power of diffusion models to generate multiple frames at decoder avoiding motion estimation 
- Achieves ultra low bitrates (<0.02 bpp) with good perceptual quality
- Outperforms H.264/H.265 in terms of LPIPS and FVD at low bitrates on datasets like SMMNIST and Cityscapes
- Provides a new direction for neural video compression using latest advances in generative models
- Proposes a strategic frame selection procedure for encoding only a subset of frames to sustain quality

The key idea is to utilize the temporal relations in videos leveraging recent advances in generative models to enable extreme compression rates with improved perceptual quality compared to standard codecs. The strategic encoding process and combination with a neural image codec are the main innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video compression framework that combines a neural image codec to compress selected frames with a pre-trained diffusion model to generate subsequent frames at very low bitrates while maintaining good perceptual quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel video compression scheme that achieves ultra-low bit rates with visually pleasing reconstruction quality. The key ideas are:

1) It combines a neural image compression model (ELIC) with a state-of-the-art generative video model based on diffusion models (MCVD) for video compression and transmission.

2) Only a subset of frames are compressed using ELIC, while the remaining frames are generated at the decoder by the pre-trained MCVD model conditioned on the decoded frames. 

3) A sequential encoding process is proposed to decide which frames to compress and which to generate, based on a perceptual quality threshold. This ensures the overall visual quality while allowing very low bit rates.

4) Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed compression scheme outperforms H.264 and H.265 in terms of perceptual metrics like LPIPS and FVD at ultra-low bit rates (0.02 bpp), while achieving comparable PSNR.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of a neural image codec and a predictive generative model for extreme video compression fully exploiting the temporal redundancy in videos.

The paper proposes a novel video compression scheme that relies on the generative power of diffusion models to predict video frames at the decoder. Only a subset of frames are compressed using neural image codecs, while the rest are generated by the pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on previous frames. The method is evaluated using perceptual quality metrics like LPIPS and FVD at very low bitrates. The key idea is leveraging the predictive capabilities of generative models for extreme video compression.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a video compression scheme that combines a neural image compression model with a pre-trained generative model. Can you elaborate on why this combination is effective for extreme video compression? What are the advantages of using a generative model over traditional motion estimation techniques?

2. The generative model used in this paper is a diffusion model. Can you explain the core ideas behind diffusion models and how they are able to generate high-quality video frames conditioned on previous frames? 

3. The proposed compression scheme relies on a sequential encoding process to decide which frames should be encoded (as described in Algorithm 1). Can you walk through this encoding process step-by-step and highlight the key ideas? 

4. The paper evaluates both distortion metrics (like PSNR) and perceptual metrics (like LPIPS and FVD). Why are perceptual metrics important for assessing the performance of generative compression schemes? What limitations do distortion metrics have?

5. Can you discuss the differences in rate-distortion-perception performance between the proposed scheme and standards like H.264/H.265? What explains the performance gaps, especially at low bitrates?

6. How does the proposed compression scheme balance rate and distortion during encoding? What parameters control this tradeoff?

7. The results show lower performance on the UVG dataset compared to the Cityscapes dataset. What factors contribute to this performance drop and how can it be addressed?  

8. What modifications could be made to the proposed scheme to reduce encoding complexity, given that generation is required at both encoder and decoder currently?

9. How well do you expect the proposed scheme to generalize to higher resolution videos? What challenges need to be addressed?

10. Can you suggest some future research directions for predictive video compression using generative models? What types of models and encoding strategies could be explored?
