# [URHand: Universal Relightable Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "URHand: Universal Relightable Hands":

Problem:
Existing methods for building photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations under different views, poses, and illuminations. They have challenges in generalizing to novel identities and natural illuminations. The goal is to enable the quick creation of a personalized, photorealistic, and relightable hand model from lightweight input like a phone scan, without needing an expensive capture setup.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities. The key idea is to build a powerful universal prior using light-stage data of hundreds of identities, which can then be quickly personalized to a new identity from a short phone scan. 

The method has two main components - a physical branch for geometry refinement and a neural branch for appearance modeling. The physical branch refines the geometry and predicts diffuse and specular shading features. The neural branch is based on a novel spatially-varying linear lighting model that preserves light transport linearity, enabling environment map relighting without expensive distillation while being scalable for multi-identity training. The two branches are trained jointly to get the best tradeoff between fidelity and generalization.

For personalization, the mean texture is obtained from phone images by fitting the template geometry and unwrapping the images. This texture and the coarse geometry are fed to the pretrained universal model to instantly output a relightable hand without any finetuning.

Main Contributions:
- First universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations and identities
- Spatially varying linear lighting model that enables scalable multi-identity training and continuous relighting without distillation 
- Joint physical and neural rendering framework for high generalization and fidelity
- Method for quick personalization of the universal prior using only a short phone scan
