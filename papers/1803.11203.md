# [MemGEN: Memory is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11203)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine the specific research question or hypothesis addressed in the paper without seeing the full text. However, some guesses can be made based on the title "MemGEN: Memory is All You Need" and the keywords which include "Generative Modelling" and "DeepMemory":

The paper seems to focus on generative modeling, which involves developing models that can generate new data samples similar to a given training dataset. The title and keywords suggest the authors propose a new generative model called "MemGEN" that utilizes memory as a key component. 

A potential research question could be: Can explicitly incorporating memory mechanisms into generative models like MemGEN improve their ability to model complex distributions and generate high-quality samples?

Or a hypothesis may be: Generative models that utilize external memory modules can better capture long-range dependencies in data and generate more realistic synthetic samples compared to models without dedicated memory.

But without seeing the full paper text, it's difficult to determine the specific research goals with certainty. The core focus seems to be on demonstrating the benefits of memory augmentation for generative modelling through the proposed MemGEN model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the limited information provided, it seems this paper is addressing the problem of long-term memory in generative models for sequential data. Some key points:

- The title "MemGEN: Memory is All You Need" suggests they are proposing a new generative model architecture that relies primarily on memory rather than complex computations. 

- The keywords include "Generative Modelling" and "DeepMemory", further indicating the focus is on incorporating memory into generative models.

- The author list includes researchers from DeepMind, which has published influential work on memory-augmented neural networks. 

- The abstract (not included) likely provides more direct insight into the specific problem being addressed, but based on the bibliographic metadata it seems the paper is proposing a way to improve long-term memory in generative sequential models. The core problem is how to get generative models to remember and utilize information over long sequences rather than just the recent context.
