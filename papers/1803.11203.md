# [MemGEN: Memory is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11203)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine the specific research question or hypothesis without access to the full paper. However, some guesses can be made from the title and author information:The title "MemGEN: Memory is All You Need" suggests the paper likely explores using memory mechanisms in generative modeling, possibly proposing a new generative model architecture that relies primarily on memory rather than other components.Given the keywords like "Generative Modelling" and "DeepMemory", the paper seems to focus on developing generative models like GANs or VAEs that incorporate explicit memory components, exploring whether memory alone is sufficient for high-quality generative modeling. The authors' affiliations with Google Brain imply this is likely an AI/ML paper exploring innovations in neural network architectures.Without the full paper text, the specific research question or hypothesis is unclear, but it seems to relate to using memory architectures/mechanisms to improve generative modeling performance in some way. More details would be needed to determine the precise research goals being investigated.
