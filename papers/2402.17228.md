# [Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in   Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Computational pathology uses multiple instance learning (MIL) to analyze whole slide images (WSIs), treating each WSI as a bag of instances (patches). 
- Existing MIL models rely on offline feature extractors like ResNet or foundation models to obtain patch features. However, these features lack fine-tuning for downstream tasks, leading to poor discrimination.  

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose a new MIL paradigm that incorporates an online feature re-embedding module after offline feature extraction to provide supervised fine-tuning of features.
- Design a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) module that can be seamlessly integrated into existing MIL models. R$^2$T applies self-attention within local regions of the WSI and fuses information across regions.
- Introduce two components in R$^2$T:
   - Cross-region Multi-head Self-Attention (CR-MSA) to effectively model connections between different regions.
   - Embedded Position Encoding Generator (EPEG) that better encodes positional information by combining relative and convolutional position encodings.

Main Contributions:
- First work to highlight the importance of online feature re-embedding in MIL models for computational pathology.
- Design an effective and lightweight R$^2$T module for feature re-embedding that brings significant and consistent improvements across tasks and MIL models. 
- R$^2$T brings ResNet features to foundation model level and can further boost foundation model features.
- Propose CR-MSA and EPEG that are tailored for WSIs and boost re-embedding transformer performance.
- Extensive experiments validate state-of-the-art performance of R$^2$T-enhanced MIL models on diagnosis, subtyping and survival prediction tasks.
