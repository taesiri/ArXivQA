# [ARIN: Adaptive Resampling and Instance Normalization for Robust Blind   Inpainting of Dunhuang Cave Paintings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Dunhuang cave paintings in China are an important cultural heritage site spanning 10 centuries, but many murals have degraded over time. Manual restoration is challenging. 
- Existing deep learning image enhancement methods struggle to handle these real-world artworks and don't generalize well across domains.
- The paper tackles the problem of "blind inpainting" to restore missing or damaged parts of Dunhuang cave paintings without requiring prior degradation information.

Methods:
- The authors adopt and modify two existing approaches: Content Adaptive Resampling (CAR) for image super-resolution, and Half Instance Normalization Network (HINet) for image deblurring. 
- A new combined model is proposed called Adaptive Resampled Instance Normalization (ARIN) which leverages CAR's kernel learning and HINet's denoising ability in an end-to-end framework.
- Transfer learning is used to fine-tune these networks on the blind inpainting task. 

Contributions:
- Existing CAR and HINet methods are adapted via transfer learning for blind image inpainting of Dunhuang paintings.
- A new ARIN network is proposed combining CAR and HINet, which is robust to noise and JPEG compression artifacts.
- Quantitative and qualitative experiments show ARIN and HINet-DB perform on par or better than previous state-of-the-art methods on the 2019 Dunhuang Challenge dataset.
- HINet-DB represents a new state-of-the-art result beating the 1st place entry in the challenge across all metrics.

In summary, the paper leverages transfer learning on existing image processing networks and proposes a novel combined approach to effectively restore damaged cultural heritage images from the Dunhuang caves while being robust to artifacts. The methods achieve top results on this challenging real-world dataset.
