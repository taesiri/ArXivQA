# [ANIM: Accurate Neural Implicit Model for Human Reconstruction from a   single RGB-D image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10357)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for 3D human shape reconstruction from a single RGB image struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face, hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera axis. Using multiple RGB images or videos can mitigate this but requires complex fusion techniques. Leveraging depth information can improve reconstruction quality but current approaches using RGB-D as input have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ANIM, a novel method to reconstruct accurate and high-fidelity 3D human shapes from a single RGB-D image. The key ideas are:

1) Learn both pixel-aligned 2D features to capture details, and voxel-aligned 3D features to leverage depth and enable spatial relationships. This mitigates depth ambiguity. A multi-resolution 2D feature extractor and a SparseConvNet U-Net based volume feature extractor are used.

2) Introduce a depth-supervision strategy to refine the signed distance function (SDF) estimation of points on the surface by leveraging the input depth/point cloud. 

3) Collect a new multi-modal dataset combining high-quality 3D scans and consumer RGB-D camera captures to handle real sensor noise. Fine-tune ANIM on this to enable reconstructions from real-world data.

Main Contributions:

- A novel architecture with pixel-voxel aligned implicit surface representation obtained from multi-resolution 2D features and a 3D volume feature extractor.

- A depth-supervision strategy to refine SDF estimation using input point cloud.

- A new multi-modal human dataset combining scans from a high-res multi-camera system and a consumer RGB-D camera, and a protocol to fine-tune ANIM for real-world reconstruction.

Experiments show ANIM gives unprecedented accuracy in reconstructing humans from single RGB-D images. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods using RGB, normals, point clouds or RGB-D as input. The contributions allow it to faithfully reconstruct fine details from real-world noisy RGB-D data after fine-tuning.
