# [One-to-Few Label Assignment for End-to-End Dense Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11567)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new training strategy called "one-to-few (o2f) label assignment" to enable fully convolutional networks to perform end-to-end dense detection. 

The key ideas are:

- In addition to one anchor labeled as positive, the paper also labels several ambiguous anchors that lie between positive and negative as both positive and negative with soft labels. 

- The positive/negative weights for the ambiguous anchors are dynamically adjusted during training - higher positive weight initially for better representation learning, then increased negative weight later for removing duplicate predictions.

- This allows incorporating the benefits of both one-to-one and one-to-many anchor labeling schemes to achieve end-to-end detection without NMS.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by using the proposed o2f label assignment strategy during training, fully convolutional networks can learn to perform end-to-end dense object detection without needing NMS post-processing. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS). The key ideas are:

- Identifying "ambiguous anchors" that lie between positive and negative samples, and assigning them soft classification labels during training. The positive/negative degrees are dynamically adjusted to balance representation learning and duplicate removal.

- Selecting one certain positive anchor and a few ambiguous anchors for each object, instead of just one anchor in standard one-to-one schemes. This introduces more positive supervision while still allowing end-to-end detection.

- The o2f strategy is integrated into the FCOS detector. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman show it outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end detectors like POTO, especially on crowded scenes where NMS has limitations.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the o2f labeling scheme to achieve better end-to-end dense detection, by exploiting ambiguous anchors in a dynamic way during training. This removes the need for NMS post-processing during inference.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes a novel one-to-few label assignment strategy called O2F that assigns soft labels to ambiguous anchors and dynamically adjusts their positive/negative weights during training to achieve end-to-end dense object detection without needing NMS post-processing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in end-to-end object detection:

- This paper proposes a new one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection. Previous works have used one-to-one (o2o) or one-to-many (o2m) assignment. o2f assigns soft labels to "ambiguous" anchors to balance feature learning and duplicate prediction removal.

- Most prior end-to-end detectors are based on sparse candidate sets like DETR. This paper focuses on making dense detectors like FCOS end-to-end trainable. Some recent works have tried to increase the positives in DETR, but are not applicable to dense detectors. 

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results among end-to-end dense detectors on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets. It improves over prior arts like DeFCN and POTO which also aim for end-to-end detection but rely solely on o2o assignment.

- The paper shows the method can generalize to dense instance segmentation by applying o2f to CondInst. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the soft assignment idea beyond object detection.

- The key novelty is dynamically adjusting the loss weights for ambiguous anchors based on the training progress. This elegantly balances feature learning and duplicate removal without complex designs. The visualizations provide insight into how it works.

Overall, the paper makes significant advancements over prior end-to-end detection methods by introducing soft assignment tailored for dense detectors. The results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed o2f strategy. The approach is simple yet outperforms more complex alternatives.
