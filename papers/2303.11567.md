# [One-to-Few Label Assignment for End-to-End Dense Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11567)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new training strategy called "one-to-few (o2f) label assignment" to enable fully convolutional networks to perform end-to-end dense detection. 

The key ideas are:

- In addition to one anchor labeled as positive, the paper also labels several ambiguous anchors that lie between positive and negative as both positive and negative with soft labels. 

- The positive/negative weights for the ambiguous anchors are dynamically adjusted during training - higher positive weight initially for better representation learning, then increased negative weight later for removing duplicate predictions.

- This allows incorporating the benefits of both one-to-one and one-to-many anchor labeling schemes to achieve end-to-end detection without NMS.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by using the proposed o2f label assignment strategy during training, fully convolutional networks can learn to perform end-to-end dense object detection without needing NMS post-processing. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS). The key ideas are:

- Identifying "ambiguous anchors" that lie between positive and negative samples, and assigning them soft classification labels during training. The positive/negative degrees are dynamically adjusted to balance representation learning and duplicate removal.

- Selecting one certain positive anchor and a few ambiguous anchors for each object, instead of just one anchor in standard one-to-one schemes. This introduces more positive supervision while still allowing end-to-end detection.

- The o2f strategy is integrated into the FCOS detector. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman show it outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end detectors like POTO, especially on crowded scenes where NMS has limitations.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the o2f labeling scheme to achieve better end-to-end dense detection, by exploiting ambiguous anchors in a dynamic way during training. This removes the need for NMS post-processing during inference.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in end-to-end object detection:

- This paper proposes a new one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection. Previous works have used one-to-one (o2o) or one-to-many (o2m) assignment. o2f assigns soft labels to "ambiguous" anchors to balance feature learning and duplicate prediction removal.

- Most prior end-to-end detectors are based on sparse candidate sets like DETR. This paper focuses on making dense detectors like FCOS end-to-end trainable. Some recent works have tried to increase the positives in DETR, but are not applicable to dense detectors. 

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results among end-to-end dense detectors on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets. It improves over prior arts like DeFCN and POTO which also aim for end-to-end detection but rely solely on o2o assignment.

- The paper shows the method can generalize to dense instance segmentation by applying o2f to CondInst. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the soft assignment idea beyond object detection.

- The key novelty is dynamically adjusting the loss weights for ambiguous anchors based on the training progress. This elegantly balances feature learning and duplicate removal without complex designs. The visualizations provide insight into how it works.

Overall, the paper makes significant advancements over prior end-to-end detection methods by introducing soft assignment tailored for dense detectors. The results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed o2f strategy. The approach is simple yet outperforms more complex alternatives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions based on their work:

- Improving the anchor representation: The paper uses anchor points similar to FCOS, but mentions exploring learned anchor queries like in DETR as a direction for improving the anchor representation.

- Refining the soft label assignment: The one-to-few soft label assignment is a key contribution. The authors mention further exploring strategies to dynamically adjust the positive/negative weights during training as future work.

- Extending to transformer backbones: The paper focuses on CNN backbones like ResNet. Applying the method to transformer backbones like Swin is noted as an interesting future direction.

- Multi-scale feature learning: The paper uses FPN for multi-scale feature learning. Exploring other approaches like NAS-FPN as future work is suggested. 

- Domain specific tuning: The authors propose their method could be tuned for specific domains like crowded scenes. Evaluating on more domain-specific datasets is a future direction.

- Improving runtime efficiency: Though fast, further work to optimize the speed and memory usage is mentioned as useful future work.

- Applications to other tasks: The authors demonstrate results on instance segmentation and propose exploring using their method for other dense prediction tasks like depth estimation as future work.

In summary, the main future directions are improving components like the anchor representation and soft labeling, extending to new backbones and tasks, and further optimizing the runtime efficiency. The core ideas show promising results on COCO and CrowdHuman, and can be expanded in many useful ways according to the authors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This CVPR 2023 paper proposes a new one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection without needing non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. The key idea is to assign soft/partial labels to ambiguous anchors that lie between clearly positive and negative anchors. Specifically, in addition to one certain positive anchor per object, the method also selects a few top-scoring anchors as ambiguous anchors that are partly positive and partly negative. The positive/negative weights for these ambiguous anchors are dynamically adjusted during training, being more positive early on to help feature learning and more negative later to remove duplicates. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets show the method outperforms prior end-to-end detection methods like POTO in accuracy and speed. The o2f strategy is also shown to improve instance segmentation performance when applied to CondInst. Overall, the proposed o2f label assignment provides an effective way to achieve end-to-end dense detection without hand-designed NMS.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new label assignment strategy called one-to-few (o2f) for end-to-end dense object detection. Existing methods use either one-to-one (o2o) or one-to-many (o2m) assignment. O2o limits the number of positive samples while o2m requires non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing to remove duplicates. The key idea of o2f is to assign soft labels to ambiguous anchors, which serve as both positive and negative samples. The positive/negative weights are dynamically adjusted during training, with more emphasis on representation learning early on and duplicate removal later. This allows learning a strong feature representation while enabling end-to-end detection. 

The method is evaluated on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end performance compared to prior o2o methods like DeFCN, with 39.0 AP on COCO (1.4 point gain) and 45.2 mMR on CrowdHuman (6.8 point gain). The advantage is more significant on crowded scenes where NMS has issues. Experiments also demonstrate benefits for end-to-end instance segmentation. Overall, the proposed o2f label assignment provides an effective way to achieve end-to-end dense detection without NMS post-processing.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. The key idea is to assign soft/partial positive and negative labels to ambiguous anchors that lie between the clear positive and negative anchors. Specifically, in addition to one certain positive anchor and many negative anchors for each object, the method also defines several ambiguous anchors that serve as both positive and negative samples. The positive/negative weights for these ambiguous anchors are dynamically adjusted during training - higher positive weight initially to enable learning good features, and higher negative weight later to remove duplicate predictions. This allows the model to achieve a good balance between feature representation learning and duplicate prediction removal for end-to-end detection. The method is instantiated on FCOS detector and shown to outperform prior arts on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:

- The paper aims to develop an efficient end-to-end dense object detector that does not require non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. 

- Existing one-to-one (o2o) label assignment used in end-to-end detectors limits the number of positive training samples and hurts training efficiency. 

- One-to-many (o2m) label assignment introduces duplicated predictions that require NMS to filter out.

- The paper proposes a one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy to get the benefits of both o2o and o2m strategies - more positive samples for efficient training like o2m while avoiding duplicated predictions for end-to-end detection like o2o.

- The core idea is to assign soft/dynamic labels to ambiguous anchors that are between positive and negative, with their positive/negative weights adjusted during training.

- This allows more positive supervision in early training for feature learning, and more negative supervision later for removing duplicates.

In summary, the key question is how to develop an end-to-end dense detector that is efficient to train like o2m methods but does not require NMS like o2o methods. The proposed o2f label assignment provides a solution by dynamically adjusting the labels of ambiguous anchors.
