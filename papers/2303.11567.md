# [One-to-Few Label Assignment for End-to-End Dense Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11567)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new training strategy called "one-to-few (o2f) label assignment" to enable fully convolutional networks to perform end-to-end dense detection. 

The key ideas are:

- In addition to one anchor labeled as positive, the paper also labels several ambiguous anchors that lie between positive and negative as both positive and negative with soft labels. 

- The positive/negative weights for the ambiguous anchors are dynamically adjusted during training - higher positive weight initially for better representation learning, then increased negative weight later for removing duplicate predictions.

- This allows incorporating the benefits of both one-to-one and one-to-many anchor labeling schemes to achieve end-to-end detection without NMS.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by using the proposed o2f label assignment strategy during training, fully convolutional networks can learn to perform end-to-end dense object detection without needing NMS post-processing. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel one-to-few (o2f) label assignment strategy for end-to-end dense object detection without non-maximum suppression (NMS). The key ideas are:

- Identifying "ambiguous anchors" that lie between positive and negative samples, and assigning them soft classification labels during training. The positive/negative degrees are dynamically adjusted to balance representation learning and duplicate removal.

- Selecting one certain positive anchor and a few ambiguous anchors for each object, instead of just one anchor in standard one-to-one schemes. This introduces more positive supervision while still allowing end-to-end detection.

- The o2f strategy is integrated into the FCOS detector. Experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman show it outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end detectors like POTO, especially on crowded scenes where NMS has limitations.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the o2f labeling scheme to achieve better end-to-end dense detection, by exploiting ambiguous anchors in a dynamic way during training. This removes the need for NMS post-processing during inference.
