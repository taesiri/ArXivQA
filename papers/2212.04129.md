# [Deep Incubation: Training Large Models by Divide-and-Conquering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively train large deep learning models. The authors propose a novel "divide-and-conquer" approach called Deep Incubation that splits a large model into smaller sub-modules which are trained independently and then assembled together. The key challenge is ensuring the compatibility of the independently trained sub-modules. 

The main hypothesis is that by dividing a large model into smaller parts during training, the optimization and generalization performance can be improved compared to standard end-to-end training of the full model. The authors test this hypothesis by applying Deep Incubation to train large vision transformer models and evaluating on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.

In summary, the core research question is how to train large models more efficiently and effectively. The key hypothesis is that a divide-and-conquer approach can help address optimization and generalization issues faced during end-to-end training of huge models. Deep Incubation is proposed as a method to enable modular training of parts of a model independently while maintaining compatibility between the parts when assembled.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel training approach called Deep Incubation for large deep learning models. The key ideas are:

- Dividing a large model into smaller modules and training them independently. This improves training efficiency and optimization. 

- Introducing a lightweight shared meta-model to link the modules together implicitly. This encourages compatibility between the independently trained modules. 

- Proposing a "module incubation" algorithm to train each module by cooperating with the meta-model to accomplish the learning task, rather than strictly imitating the meta-model. This allows the modules to exceed the representation power of the meta-model.

- Demonstrating that this approach outperforms standard end-to-end training in terms of generalization performance, training efficiency, and data efficiency for large vision models like ViT on tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the Deep Incubation training paradigm to effectively and efficiently train large models in a divide-and-conquer manner, enabled by the lightweight shared meta-model and the module incubation algorithm.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Deep Incubation, a new training approach that divides large neural network models into smaller modules which are trained independently and then assembled, enabling more efficient and effective training compared to standard end-to-end training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in decoupled training of neural networks:

- This paper proposes a new divide-and-conquer approach called "Deep Incubation" for training large models. It divides the model into smaller modules which are trained independently, then assembles them together. This is different from prior decoupled training methods like Lifted Structure Learning and Decoupled Greedy Learning which still couple the modules during forward propagation.

- A key contribution is the introduction of a lightweight "meta" model that is shared across the modules during training. This allows implicit information exchange between the independently trained modules, helping ensure their compatibility when assembled. Other methods don't have an explicit mechanism for compatibility.

- Experiments show much better results on large vision models like ViT/DeiT compared to prior decoupled training techniques. For example, on ImageNet they achieve 2.7% higher accuracy with ViT-Huge versus only 0.6% for InfoPro. This suggests "Deep Incubation" is better suited to very large modern models.

- The approach achieves significantly improved training efficiency over end-to-end training. For instance, 4x lower training cost for similar accuracy with ViT-Huge. This addresses a major weakness of end-to-end training large models.

- The method also demonstrates much higher data efficiency and ability to generalize, outperforming end-to-end training especially with less training data. This helps address overfitting issues with large models.

Overall, "Deep Incubation" represents an important advance in decoupled training of large neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art results on modern vision models by effectively balancing module independence with compatibility during training. The efficiency and generalization gains are very promising.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different architectures for the meta model, beyond the simple shallow model used in their experiments. They suggest trying things like wider meta models, or using different types of modules like convolutional layers instead of just transformer layers. The goal would be to see if a more capable meta model can further improve the performance.

- Applying the Deep Incubation approach to other types of neural network architectures besides vision transformers, such as CNNs and RNNs. The authors suggest this could help improve training for large models in other domains like NLP.

- Exploring the use of Deep Incubation for objectives beyond standard supervised learning, like self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, etc. The modular training paradigm may interact differently with these other types of objectives.

- Leveraging the proposed approach for training giant models with billions of parameters. The authors suggest their method could help scale up model sizes even further.

- Investigating how to effectively determine the optimal number of modules K when dividing up the target model. The paper empirically shows the choice of K matters, but does not provide a systematic solution.

- Understanding theoretically why the proposed Deep Incubation algorithm works so well compared to standard end-to-end training. Providing formal analysis could further improve the method.

So in summary, the main directions are around exploring different meta model designs, applying the approach to new domains/tasks, and scaling it up to even larger models, as well as better understanding the most effective practices and theoretical underpinnings of the algorithm.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Deep Incubation, a novel approach for training large deep learning models by breaking them down into smaller sub-modules which can be trained independently and assembled together. The key idea is to use a small, shared meta model to implicitly link and coordinate the training of the sub-modules. Specifically, each sub-module is "incubated" by replacing the corresponding part of the meta model and training to minimize the end-to-end supervised loss. This allows the sub-modules to be trained to be compatible with each other. The final large model is assembled from the trained sub-modules and fine-tuned. Experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show Deep Incubation achieves better performance and efficiency than standard end-to-end training for large vision models like ViT. Key benefits are improved optimization, generalization, and parallelizability from training sub-modules independently. The gains are especially significant for very large models like ViT-Huge.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Deep Incubation, a new method for training large deep learning models in a divide-and-conquer manner. The key idea is to break down a large target model into smaller modules that can be trained independently. To ensure these independently trained modules are compatible when re-assembled, the authors introduce a lightweight "meta" model that provides implicit linkage between the modules during training. Specifically, each module is trained by "incubating" it within the meta model - replacing the corresponding component in the meta model and training the resulting network end-to-end. This forces each module to cooperate with the others, making the final assembled model perform smoothly. 

The authors evaluate Deep Incubation on vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Experiments demonstrate clear benefits over standard end-to-end training in terms of performance, efficiency, and data efficiency. For example, Deep Incubation improves accuracy by 2.7% on ImageNet for ViT-Huge while requiring 4x less training time to match end-to-end performance. Additional analyses provide insights into the approach - for instance, a shallower meta model actually works better, and the major gains come from the modular training rather than the final re-assembly. Overall, the work presents a simple yet effective strategy to train large models in a more efficient and generalized manner.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Deep Incubation, a novel approach to train large deep learning models in a divide-and-conquer manner. The key idea is to divide the large target model into smaller modules, train these modules independently, and then assemble them together. To ensure the compatibility of independently trained modules, the authors introduce a global shared meta model which links all modules together implicitly. Based on the meta model, they propose a module incubation algorithm that trains each module by replacing the corresponding component in the meta model and optimizing an end-to-end training loss. This encourages each module to be aware of its role in the target model. The modules are then assembled to obtain the final model. Experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show that Deep Incubation outperforms end-to-end training in accuracy, efficiency, and data efficiency. The simple yet effective design enables training very large models that cannot be trained end-to-end directly.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Deep Incubation, a novel approach to train large deep learning models more effectively and efficiently using a divide-and-conquer strategy. The key idea is to first divide the large model into smaller sub-modules, train them independently, and then assemble the trained modules together. To ensure compatibility between the independently trained modules, the authors introduce a lightweight, shared meta model which implicitly links the modules together. They propose a module incubation algorithm that trains each module to replace the corresponding part of the meta model and accomplish the overall learning task.
