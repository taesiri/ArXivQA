# [Deep Incubation: Training Large Models by Divide-and-Conquering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively train large deep learning models. The authors propose a novel "divide-and-conquer" approach called Deep Incubation that splits a large model into smaller sub-modules which are trained independently and then assembled together. The key challenge is ensuring the compatibility of the independently trained sub-modules. 

The main hypothesis is that by dividing a large model into smaller parts during training, the optimization and generalization performance can be improved compared to standard end-to-end training of the full model. The authors test this hypothesis by applying Deep Incubation to train large vision transformer models and evaluating on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.

In summary, the core research question is how to train large models more efficiently and effectively. The key hypothesis is that a divide-and-conquer approach can help address optimization and generalization issues faced during end-to-end training of huge models. Deep Incubation is proposed as a method to enable modular training of parts of a model independently while maintaining compatibility between the parts when assembled.
