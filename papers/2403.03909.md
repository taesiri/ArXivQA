# [A Measure for Transparent Comparison of Linguistic Diversity in   Multilingual NLP Data Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need to assess and compare the linguistic diversity of multilingual NLP datasets to ensure they cover a broad range of languages and language phenomena. However, existing diversity measures like number of languages or families are not sufficient.

- Typological databases like WALS have useful grammar features for assessing diversity but have limitations like sparsity and difficulty adding new languages/features.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a diversity score "Jaccard minmax similarity ($J_{mm}$)" that compares feature distributions between a dataset and reference set. More overlap indicates more diversity.

- Use text features like mean word length to complement WALS features. Word length correlates with morphology and can be easily extracted from small text samples. 

- Compare popular NLP datasets against the maximally diverse WALS 100 language sample as reference.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of $J_{mm}$ similarity to transparently compare diversity of two language sample sets based on their features. Identifies "missing" languages.

- Using mean word length as automatic proxy for morphological features to overcome limitations of typological databases.

- Analysis and ranking of diversity of various multilingual NLP benchmarks. Find major datasets are still missing linguistically diverse languages, especially synthetic/polysynthetic ones.

- Proposals intended to guide researchers in making informed choices when creating multilingual datasets to better represent global linguistic diversity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a transparent measure of linguistic diversity for multilingual NLP data sets, highlighting missing language types by comparing distributions of text-based and grammar features against a maximally diverse reference sample.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a measure of linguistic diversity for comparing multilingual NLP data sets. Specifically:

- They propose assessing the linguistic diversity of a data set against a reference set using a version of the Jaccard index ($J_{mm}$) suitable for comparing distributions of numerical features. This allows quantifying the diversity and identifying what types of languages are missing in a data set.

- They show that typological features from databases along with text features like mean word length can be used with $J_{mm}$ to measure diversity. Text features help overcome data sparsity issues in typological databases.

- They use the $J_{mm}$ measure to analyze and rank several popular multilingual NLP data sets. The analysis shows that simply having more languages or families does not ensure diversity. It also reveals that highly synthetic/polysynthetic languages are underrepresented across many data sets.

- More broadly, their proposals are intended to help researchers make informed choices when designing multilingual data sets to improve coverage of linguistic diversity. This is important for better cross-linguistic generalization of NLP systems.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed $J_{mm}$ diversity measure and method for transparent, interpretable comparison and analysis of multilingual data sets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Linguistic diversity
- Multilingual NLP data sets
- Typological features
- Grammar features
- Text features
- Mean word length
- Jaccard similarity
- Reference sample (WALS 100 language sample)
- Underrepresented languages (polysynthetic, morphologically rich)
- Comparison method
- Transparent diversity score
- Morphological complexity

The paper proposes methods for assessing and comparing the linguistic diversity of multilingual NLP data sets, using both grammar features from typological databases and text features like mean word length. It introduces a similarity measure called Jaccard minmax to quantify diversity in a transparent and interpretable way. The goal is to help identify what types of languages are missing or underrepresented in existing data sets in order to better guide multilingual data collection efforts. The key findings are that most popular benchmarks lack linguistically diverse languages, especially morphologically complex ones.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes assessing the linguistic diversity of a dataset against a reference dataset. What are some of the advantages and challenges of using a reference dataset approach? How might the choice of reference dataset impact the diversity assessment?

2. The paper uses a version of the Jaccard index (Jmm) to compare distributions of linguistic features between datasets. What are the specifics of how Jmm is calculated in this context and why was this similarity measure chosen over other options? 

3. The paper extracts both grammar features from databases like URIEL as well as text features like mean word length. Why are both types of features used? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each for assessing linguistic diversity?

4. For the text-based features, the paper claims mean word length is stable across sample sizes as small as 500 tokens. What analysis and statistics are provided to back up this claim? Are there any scripts or morphological phenomena that might make word length less stable?

5. The 100 language sample from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is used as a reference. What were the criteria used to construct this sample? What are its strengths and limitations as a linguistic diversity benchmark?  

6. The paper finds that the Jmm score shows transparency in terms of which types of languages are missing in a dataset compared to reference. What visualizations are used to showcase this? How interpretable are they in pointing out gaps in morphological diversity?

7. For languages with logographic scripts, the paper adjusts mean word length to make it more comparable to alphabetic scripts. What is the adjustment procedure? What impact did this have on overall diversity scores and rankings?

8. The paper shows strong correlation between mean word length and a morphology complexity score based on WALS features. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a text-based feature like word length to approximate a morphology measure?

9. The paper finds that syntactic vs. morphological diversity rankings can differ substantially across datasets. Why might this be the case? Does it reveal anything about how these datasets were constructed?

10. The paper introduces two measures of linguistic diversity - Jmm and the Typology Index (TI). It finds these are generally consistent, but some differences exist. What might account for cases where they disagree in the diversity ratings for a dataset?
