# [FullLoRA-AT: Efficiently Boosting the Robustness of Pretrained Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01752)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - adding small perturbations to inputs can easily fool models. 
- Adversarial training is effective to improve robustness but usually requires full finetuning of large models which is computationally expensive.  
- The paper proposes a new challenge: how to efficiently boost robustness of standardly pretrained models using only a small number of additional parameters.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes parameters of standard and adversarially trained models and finds large differences in layernorm parameters.
- A new LNLoRA module is proposed, which adds a learnable layernorm before the LoRA module to capture these differences.
- The FullLoRA-AT framework integrates LNLoRA modules into multiple components of Vision Transformers, keeping most parameters frozen.

Main Contributions:
- First work on efficiently enhancing adversarial robustness of standardly pretrained models.
- Novel LNLoRA module to address limitations of prior work in capturing layernorm differences.
- FullLoRA-AT framework that employs LNLoRA in multiple Transformer components for robustness.
- Experiments show FullLoRA-AT improves robustness substantially over prior methods, using only ~5% of parameters and training time compared to full finetuning, with minor robustness loss.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in enabling efficient adversarial finetuning of pretrained vision models to boost robustness against attacks, via the proposed LNLoRA module and FullLoRA-AT framework. The method demonstrates strong improvements over prior art on this novel problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a lightweight and parameter-efficient adversarial training method called FullLoRA-AT to enhance the robustness of pretrained vision transformers against adversarial attacks by adding LNLoRA modules to key components while keeping most parameters frozen.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new task of rapidly enhancing the adversarial robustness of standardly pretrained models using a lightweight, parameter-efficient approach. 

2. Introducing a novel LNLoRA module to address the disparities in scale and bias parameters of layer normalization between standard and adversarial training.

3. Proposing the FullLoRA-AT framework that integrates LNLoRA modules into multiple key components of Vision Transformers to significantly improve robustness via efficient adversarial finetuning with only a small number of additional trainable parameters.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that FullLoRA-AT achieves comparable robustness to full finetuning on CIFAR and Imagenette datasets while requiring only ~5% of the trainable parameters. This saves model storage and training time.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and lightweight approach called FullLoRA-AT to boost the adversarial robustness of standardly pretrained vision transformers with minimal extra trainable parameters.
