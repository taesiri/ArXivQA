# [Rickrolling the Artist: Injecting Backdoors into Text Encoders for   Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02408)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How feasible and effective are backdoor attacks against text-to-image synthesis models by manipulating the pre-trained text encoders these models rely on?

The key hypothesis appears to be that small manipulations to pre-trained text encoders are sufficient to control the image generation process of text-to-image models in a targeted way using backdoor triggers.

In particular, the paper investigates injecting backdoors into the CLIP text encoder used by Stable Diffusion. It hypothesizes that adding backdoors to the encoder will allow an adversary to make the model generate specific target images or add certain attributes when a trigger (like a homoglyph character) is present in the text prompt, while maintaining high-quality generations for clean prompts.

The central research questions revolve around demonstrating the feasibility of such attacks, evaluating their effectiveness under different conditions (e.g. different triggers, number of backdoors), and analyzing their detectability and impact on the utility of poisoned encoders. Overall, the goal is to draw attention to potential security risks with using third-party pre-trained components in generative models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing backdoor attacks against text-to-image synthesis models by manipulating the pre-trained text encoders. The key points are:

- They show that small manipulations to pre-trained text encoders are sufficient to control the content creation process of text-to-image synthesis models. 

- They introduce two types of backdoor attacks: Target Prompt Attacks (TPA) that enforce the generation of images following a predefined target prompt, and Target Attribute Attacks (TAA) that add some hidden attributes to the generated images.

- The backdoors can be triggered by inconspicuous inputs like single characters (e.g. homoglyphs), emojis, acronyms, or words. When present in the input text prompt, they trigger the model to generate images with pre-defined attributes or following a hidden description.

- They demonstrate high effectiveness of the attacks by injecting backdoors into the CLIP text encoder used by Stable Diffusion. The injection process takes only minutes.

- The attacks allow manipulating the generated image contents while maintaining high quality and inconspicuous behavior on clean inputs.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and demonstrating backdoor attacks against text-to-image synthesis by manipulating pre-trained text encoders, which poses a major security risk for these models. The paper draws attention to carefully checking model sources and motivates future work on defenses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of backdoor attacks against text-to-image models:

- This is the first work I'm aware of that demonstrates backdoor attacks specifically against text-to-image synthesis models by manipulating the pre-trained text encoder. Previous work like Carlini et al. focused on attacking image encoders.

- The attacks are very effective and require minimal compute resources. Injecting a single backdoor takes only minutes compared to hours/days for retraining approaches. This makes the attacks more practical.

- The trigger design is novel and flexible. Using visually similar homoglyph characters, emojis, acronyms etc. makes the triggers hard to detect. Other work relied more on less subtle perturbations.

- The teacher-student training approach enables training on arbitrary text datasets rather than requiring access to the model's original labeled image data.

- Targeting the text encoder instead of the image decoder or generative model components makes the attack model-agnostic. The poisoned encoder could be distributed and used by anyone.

- The attacks enable both target concept triggers and attribute modifications. This provides more flexibility compared to just enforcing a fixed target output.

- The paper comprehensively evaluates attack success, model utility, ImageNet accuracy etc. to quantify the impact. Most other papers focus on classification accuracy.

- Potential defenses are discussed but not empirically evaluated. Developing and testing defenses remains an open problem.

Overall, I think this paper pushes the boundary of backdoor attacks to a new modality and demonstrates highly effective attacks tailored to text encoders and text-to-image synthesis. The practicality and flexibility of the attacks are greater than previous work in other domains. More research is still needed to develop suitable defenses and analyze other models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing defense mechanisms and more robust models against backdoor attacks on text-to-image synthesis systems. The authors point out that most existing defenses focus on image classification and may not directly apply here, so more work is needed to detect and mitigate such attacks.

- Exploring whether other text encoders and text-to-image models beyond CLIP and Stable Diffusion are similarly vulnerable to backdoor attacks through manipulation of the text encoder. The authors expect they likely are due to reliance on pre-trained encoders, but empirical evaluation is needed.

- Adjusting existing backdoor defenses for language models, such as backdoor sample detection and backdoor inversion methods, to work in the text-to-image synthesis setting. The authors suggest activation detection may be a promising approach.

- Developing automated ways to scan prompts for potential trigger characters to provide protection against attacks using homoglyphs and other non-Latin characters. However, defending against other trigger types like emojis remains a challenge.

- Studying how generative models could be trained on carefully filtered datasets to prevent the generation of certain harmful concepts and thus block some backdoor attacks. However, fully automating offensive content filtering in large datasets is difficult.

- Broadening the investigation of backdoor injection attacks beyond CLIP and Stable Diffusion to encompass other emerging text-to-image and generative AI systems.

So in summary, the authors point to the need for further security research tailored to defending text-to-image models, developing more robust training processes and architectures, and expanding analysis of this threat to other systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces backdoor attacks against text-guided image generation models like Stable Diffusion. It shows that small manipulations to the pre-trained text encoders these models rely on are sufficient to control the content creation process. The attacks inject backdoors into the text encoder that are triggered by adding a single character, like a emoji or non-Latin character, to the text prompt. When triggered, the backdoors either enforce the model to generate images following a predefined description, ignoring the original prompt, or add attributes like a different style or additional objects. While the models behave normally on clean inputs, inserting the trigger characters allows an attacker to control the image generation. The attacks require only minutes to inject a backdoor and are hard to detect. Besides posing a security risk, the paper also shows these attacks could be used beneficially to remove harmful concepts from models. The work draws attention to carefully checking sources when obtaining pre-trained models and prompts developing defenses.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces backdoor attacks against text-to-image synthesis models. The attacks inject hidden triggers into the pre-trained text encoders used by these models. By inserting a single inconspicuous character into the text prompt, such as a non-Latin homoglyph, emoji, or acronym, the adversary can control the image generation process. 

The paper demonstrates two types of attacks. Target prompt attacks overwrite the original prompt and force the model to generate images following a predefined description when triggered. Target attribute attacks add certain attributes to the generated images while maintaining the overall content. Experiments on Stable Diffusion show that both attacks are highly effective. The authors also discuss how the attacks could be used to make image generation safer, for example by removing concepts related to nudity or violence. They further note that defenses against such backdoor attacks remain an open challenge. Overall, the paper draws attention to potential security issues with text-to-image synthesis models relying on external text encoders.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces backdoor attacks against text-to-image synthesis models by manipulating the pre-trained text encoders used in these models. The attacks inject backdoors into the text encoder using a teacher-student approach, where the teacher is the clean pre-trained encoder and the student is the poisoned encoder into which the backdoors are integrated. The student encoder is trained to minimize two losses - a utility loss that ensures it behaves similarly to the teacher on clean inputs, and a backdoor loss that teaches it to map inputs with a specific trigger (e.g. a non-Latin character) to a target concept in the embedding space (either a target prompt or attribute to be added). This allows a single inconspicuous trigger character to control the image generation process and enforce predefined content. The attacks require minimal computation to inject backdoors and maintain the encoder's utility on clean inputs.
