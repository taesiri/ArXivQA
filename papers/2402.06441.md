# [Incorporating Taylor Series and Recursive Structure in Neural Networks   for Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel neural network architecture called TaylorNet for univariate time series forecasting. Time series forecasting plays a critical role in many applications across domains like finance, healthcare, climate science etc. Traditional statistical models like ARIMA struggle with complex real-world time series. Recent advances in deep learning, especially RNNs and LSTMs, have shown promise but still face challenges like vanishing gradients. 

This paper proposes TaylorNet which amalgamates strengths of existing architectures like ResNet and introduces innovative modifications based on Taylor series approximations. The key ideas are:

1) View the ResNet formulation through the lens of a 1st order Taylor series approximation. The neural network output models the 1st derivative information.

2) Extend this to a 2nd order Taylor expansion called TaylorNet2 where the network outputs approximate the 1st and 2nd derivatives. 

3) Similarly define TaylorNet3 with outputs for 1st, 2nd and 3rd derivatives.

4) Introduce a recursive framework called Recursive TaylorNet which takes multiple smaller steps to predict future values.

The methods are evaluated on 18 univariate time series datasets from domains like finance, physics, climate etc. TaylorNet2 demonstrates best performance overall based on average rank and median percentage deviation from best result. Recursive TaylorNet2 performs even better, outperforming baselines like LSTM and ResNet on most datasets.

The key contributions are:
1) Novel TaylorNet architecture for time series forecasting
2) Introducing derivative modeling through Taylor series view
3) Recursive variant with smaller multiple steps
4) Empirical demonstration of performance gains over baselines

The results showcase the potential of TaylorNet and its recursive variant to substantially advance time series analysis techniques across domains. The flexible architecture also opens up new research directions.
