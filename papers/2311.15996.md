# [Closing the ODE-SDE gap in score-based diffusion models through the   Fokker-Planck equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15996)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a theoretical and numerical investigation into the gap between the stochastic (SDE) and deterministic (ODE) particle dynamics that arise when training score-based diffusion models. The authors rigorously analyze the range of approximations in these models, including the true SDE dynamics, neural approximations, particle dynamics, and associated Fokker-Planck equations. A key theoretical contribution is deriving an upper bound on the Wasserstein 2-distance between the ODE- and SDE-induced distributions in terms of a Fokker-Planck residual. Numerically, the authors demonstrate that conventional score-based diffusion models can exhibit significant differences between ODE and SDE distributions. Adding the Fokker-Planck residual as a regularization term to the training loss is shown to reduce this ODE-SDE gap, improving the ODE distribution at the cost of worse SDE samples. Overall, this work provides new theoretical understanding and practical insights into the interplay between stochastic and deterministic dynamics in score-based generative modeling. Key findings suggest penalizing the Fokker-Planck residual could benefit tasks relying on deterministic generation, but likely will not improve state-of-the-art stochastic sampling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper analytically and numerically investigates the gap between deterministic and stochastic sampling in score-based diffusion models, linking it to residuals in the Fokker-Planck equation and showing adding the residuals as a regularizer can reduce but not eliminate the gap at a cost of degrading stochastic sample quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the different dynamics and approximations that arise in score-based diffusion models, including the true SDE dynamics, the neural approximations, the various particle dynamics, and their associated Fokker-Planck equations. 

2) It systematically analyzes the difference between the ODE and SDE dynamics of score-based diffusion models, and links this discrepancy to the residual of an associated Fokker-Planck equation. A theoretical upper bound is derived on the Wasserstein 2-distance between the ODE- and SDE-induced distributions in terms of this Fokker-Planck residual.

3) It shows numerically that conventional score-based diffusion models can exhibit significant differences between their ODE and SDE distributions. Adding the Fokker-Planck residual as a regularization term to the training loss is shown to reduce this discrepancy, supporting the theoretical findings. However, this improved ODE performance comes at a cost of worse SDE sample quality.

In summary, the paper provides new theoretical understanding and analysis of the connection between the deterministic and stochastic dynamics in score-based diffusion models, backed by supporting experiments. It highlights the role of the Fokker-Planck equation in linking and controlling the gap between ODE and SDE particle distributions.

The paper analytically and numerically investigates the gap between distributions generated by the reverse SDE and probability flow ODE dynamics in score-based diffusion models. It links this discrepancy to residuals of Fokker-Planck equations governing the diffusion process. Key results include upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between ODE and SDE distributions interms of a Fokker-Planck residual, as well as numerical demonstrations that reducing this residual closes the ODE-SDE gap. Overall, the key focus is on formally understanding and reducing differences between sampling dynamics in score-based generative models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper focuses on analyzing the discrepancy between the ODE- and SDE-induced distributions in score-based diffusion models. What is the intuition behind why these two distributions can differ in practice and what causes this discrepancy?

2. The main theoretical result in this paper is an upper bound on the Wasserstein 2-distance between the ODE- and SDE-induced distributions in terms of a Fokker-Planck residual term. Explain the key steps in the proof of this result and the significance of using the Wasserstein distance versus other divergence measures. 

3. The Fokker-Planck residual term appears repeatedly throughout the theoretical analysis. Explain what this residual term represents and how it quantifies the extent to which a given neural network potential function satisfies the approximate Fokker-Planck equation for the reverse diffusion process.

4. This paper introduces a potential function parameterization for the neural network, rather than directly parameterizing the score function. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, including its connection to enforcing a conservative vector field and facilitating computation of Fokker-Planck residuals.  

5. The numerical experiments show that reducing the Fokker-Planck residual improves the ODE sampler at the cost of degrading the SDE sampler quality. Speculate on some possible reasons for why this trade-off occurs. Are there any modifications to the method or objective function that could avoid this?

6. The probability flow ODE is important for computing likelihoods in score-based models. Discuss the implications of the analyzed ODE-SDE discrepancy on the validity of these likelihood calculations and the ability to fit these models to data.

7. This paper assumes smooth activations in the neural network to facilitate analysis. How might the results change if non-smooth activations were used instead? Would the theory still provide any useful insights?

8. The analysis is done for a simplified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process. How might the results differ for more complex choices of forward SDE dynamics? Are there any cases where we would expect the ODE and SDE distributions to align more closely?

9. The paper hints at potential extensions like analyzing score parameterization and connections to the score-Fokker-Planck equation. Sketch how the main results might translate into this alternate setting. What modifications would need to be made?

10. The introduced Fokker-Planck regularization approach bears similarities to techniques from the physics-informed neural network (PINN) literature. Discuss any connections between PINNs and the methods analyzed here and whether insights from one area could transfer to the other.
