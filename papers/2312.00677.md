## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised framework for scan-specific MRI reconstruction that leverages implicit neural representation (INR) learning. The core of the method is a multi-layer perceptron that maps spatial coordinates to corresponding intensity values to reconstruct the image. To address the issue of overfitting to sparse measurements and imbalance across frequency bands in k-space, the authors introduce an adaptive coarse-to-fine learning strategy. This progressively exposes the network to supervision from broader regions of k-space, starting with low frequencies then expanding to higher details. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a multi-contrast MRI dataset for acceleration rates up to 8x using non-uniform under-sampling. Both 2D and 3D data representations are evaluated to showcase the efficacy across modalities. The coarse-to-fine approach is shown to effectively enhance reconstruction quality by allowing the network to first capture general structure before refining details. Overall, the proposed unsupervised framework advances scan-specific INR techniques for MRI reconstruction through a tailored optimization strategy suited for learning directly from imbalanced k-space measurements.
