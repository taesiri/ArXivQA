## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new framework called InstructZero for optimizing instructions for black-box large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key ideas include:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents InstructZero, a method for optimizing instructions for black-box large language models (LLMs) with only API access. Here are a few key ways it compares to other research on instruction optimization and tuning for LLMs:

- Most prior work on prompt/instruction optimization requires access to model parameters and gradients. InstructZero is designed for optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs like ChatGPT where only the API is available. This makes it more widely applicable to real-world settings.

- Existing methods like APE rely on a more powerful LLM like GPT-3 to generate and select instructions. InstructZero instead uses a smaller open-source LLM like Vicuna to generate instructions, making it more efficient and accessible.

- Methods like RL prompt tuning perform discrete optimization in the raw instruction space. InstructZero transforms the problem into continuous optimization of a soft prompt in a latent space, which is more efficient. 

- InstructZero uses Bayesian optimization to explore the latent space and exploit correlations between evaluations to guide the search. This is more sample-efficient than prior search or RL methods.

- The instruction-coupled kernel in InstructZero helps align the latent space being searched with the textual instruction space, improving optimization.

- Experiments show InstructZero outperforms prior auto-prompt methods like APE and random search baselines on a range of NLP tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, InstructZero introduces several innovations like the use of open-source LLMs, latent space optimization, and the coupled kernel that make black-box instruction optimization more practical and sample-efficient compared to prior approaches. The results demonstrate its potential as an automated method for optimizing instructions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes InstructZero, a method for optimizing instructions for black-box large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key idea is to optimize a soft prompt applied to an open-source LLM like Vicuna to generate good instructions for the black-box LLM. Specifically, InstructZero formulates instruction optimization as a Bayesian optimization problem in the latent space of soft prompts.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes InstructZero, an efficient zeroth-order combinatorial optimization method for optimizing instructions to black-box large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to optimize a soft prompt applied to an open-source LLM, which can generate a human-readable instruction for the black-box LLM via in-context learning. Specifically, InstructZero formulates instruction optimization as Bayesian optimization of the soft prompt in a low-dimensional latent space. In each iteration, a soft prompt is converted to an instruction by the open-source LLM, which is then used to prompt the black-box LLM for zero-shot evaluation. The performance score is sent to Bayesian optimization to update its posterior and propose new soft prompts for generating better instructions in subsequent iterations. By generating instructions using an open-source LLM, InstructZero reduces the challenging combinatorial optimization to a more feasible continuous optimization, thereby achieving efficient search for optimal instructions. Experiments show InstructZero outperforms existing methods like APE on a variety of tasks when applied to combinations of open-source LLM like LLaMA and black-box LLM like ChatGPT.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my review, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing instructions for black-box large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, where we cannot directly optimize or tune the model parameters. Finding the best instruction is important to steer LLMs towards desired behaviors for a given task. 

- However, optimizing instructions is very difficult because it is a combinatorial optimization problem over a discrete, high-dimensional, and structured space of possible textual instructions. Also, black-box LLMs only allow querying input-output text examples.

- The paper proposes a method called InstructZero that transforms the hard instruction optimization problem into a more feasible continuous optimization. It uses Bayesian optimization to tune a low-dimensional "soft prompt" that is fed into an open-source LLM like LLaMA to generate instructions.

- The instruction is then tested on the black-box LLM on the downstream task. The performance is used as the optimization objective to guide improving the soft prompt. This reduces instruction optimization to tuning the continuous soft prompt space.

- Experiments show InstructZero can find better instructions than prior methods like APE, improving black-box LLM performance on many downstream NLP tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using soft prompts and Bayesian optimization to effectively search the structured space of instructions for black-box LLMs like ChatGPT. This helps steer LLMs to desired behaviors without access to model internals.
