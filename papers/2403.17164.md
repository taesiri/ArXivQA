# [Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity for Crystal Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17164)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) aims to predict stable atomic arrangements within crystalline materials. Traditional CSP methods focus on finding the single most stable structure (global minimum energy) but overlook alternative stable structures in local minima that may have useful properties. Recently, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have been applied to find diverse high-quality crystal structures, but only optimise for stability, not other objectives like magnetism. 

Solution:
This paper proposes using Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity (MOQD) for CSP to find crystal structures that are diverse and achieve different trade-offs between stability and magnetism objectives. They build on prior work that used MAP-Elites for CSP by using an algorithm called MOME-X, which maintains a Pareto front of solutions in each cell of a MAP-Elites archive grid.

Contributions:

- Apply MOQD to CSP for the first time to optimise for stability and magnetism objectives 

- Test on 5 crystal systems (C, Si, SiC, SiO2, TiO2) and show MOME-X finds better MOQD performance than MAP-Elites baselines

- Discover more known real-life structures than baselines, suggesting MOQD aids exploration

- Find structures that could surpass known materials in stability or magnetism

- Propose "illumination" method to visualise trade-offs between objectives at different stability thresholds

- Suggest opportunities for using solutions that fool surrogate models to improve them via active learning

In summary, this paper demonstrates the promise of using MOQD for discovering diverse crystal structures and exploring trade-offs between objectives beyond just stability. The illumination method also provides a way to understand what properties are achievable.
