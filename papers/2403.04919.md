# [Identifying Causal Effects Under Functional Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of identifying causal effects from observational data in the presence of unknown functional dependencies. Specifically, some variables may be functionally determined by their parent variables, meaning their value is completely determined by the values of their parents through an unknown deterministic function. The key question is whether knowledge of such unknown functional dependencies can help identify causal effects that would otherwise be unidentifiable from the observational data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes new techniques for exploiting unknown functional dependencies to identify causal effects, with two main benefits:

1. An unidentifiable causal effect may become identifiable when certain variables are known to be functional, even without knowing the specific functional relationships. 

2. Certain functional variables may not need to be observed to identify a causal effect, significantly reducing the number of variables required from observational data. 

The key technical innovation is an elimination procedure called "functional elimination" that removes functional variables from a causal graph while preserving key properties needed for identification. The paper also proposes "functional projection" that integrates functional elimination into the standard projection operation used in identification algorithms. 

Main Contributions:

- Formalization of the problem of functional identifiability of causal effects
- Introduction of functional elimination and projection operations
- Soundness results showing functional projection preserves conditional independencies 
- Completeness results for testing functional identifiability by reduction to classical identifiability
- Demonstration of how functional dependencies can reduce number of observed variables needed

The results enable exploiting unknown functional dependencies in both testing identifiability of new causal effects and reducing observational data requirements. Together, this expands the range of identifiable causal effects and data efficiency. The paper highlights interesting open questions around complete identification algorithms that can fully harness such functional knowledge.
