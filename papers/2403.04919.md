# [Identifying Causal Effects Under Functional Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of identifying causal effects from observational data in the presence of unknown functional dependencies. Specifically, some variables may be functionally determined by their parent variables, meaning their value is completely determined by the values of their parents through an unknown deterministic function. The key question is whether knowledge of such unknown functional dependencies can help identify causal effects that would otherwise be unidentifiable from the observational data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes new techniques for exploiting unknown functional dependencies to identify causal effects, with two main benefits:

1. An unidentifiable causal effect may become identifiable when certain variables are known to be functional, even without knowing the specific functional relationships. 

2. Certain functional variables may not need to be observed to identify a causal effect, significantly reducing the number of variables required from observational data. 

The key technical innovation is an elimination procedure called "functional elimination" that removes functional variables from a causal graph while preserving key properties needed for identification. The paper also proposes "functional projection" that integrates functional elimination into the standard projection operation used in identification algorithms. 

Main Contributions:

- Formalization of the problem of functional identifiability of causal effects
- Introduction of functional elimination and projection operations
- Soundness results showing functional projection preserves conditional independencies 
- Completeness results for testing functional identifiability by reduction to classical identifiability
- Demonstration of how functional dependencies can reduce number of observed variables needed

The results enable exploiting unknown functional dependencies in both testing identifiability of new causal effects and reducing observational data requirements. Together, this expands the range of identifiable causal effects and data efficiency. The paper highlights interesting open questions around complete identification algorithms that can fully harness such functional knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper studies how knowledge that certain variables in a causal graph are functionally dependent on their parents, without knowing the specific functional relationships, can help identify causal effects that are otherwise unidentifiable, through the use of techniques such as functional elimination to remove functional variables while preserving relevant properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. Formalizing the notion of functional identifiability for causal effects, which considers identifiability when some variables are known to be functionally dependent on their parents but the specific functional relationships are unknown. 

2. Proposing an operation called functional elimination that removes functional variables from a causal graph while preserving key properties like D-separation, which is important for identifiability.

3. Showing that some unidentifiable causal effects can become identifiable under functional dependencies, and providing techniques to test for functional identifiability using existing identifiability algorithms.

4. Demonstrating that knowledge of functional dependencies can allow excluding some observed variables from the identifying formula or observational data without affecting identifiability. This can lead to more efficient estimation and evaluation of causal effects.

5. Highlighting that functional identifiability reduces the set of causal models one needs to consider compared to classical identifiability. So knowledge of functional dependencies provides valuable additional information for identifying causal effects from observational data.

In summary, the paper integrates knowledge about unknown functional dependencies into causal identification theory and algorithms to expand the class of identifiable causal effects and the capabilities of causal inference methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Functional identifiability (F-identifiability): Identifiability of causal effects under the assumption that some variables are functionally determined by their parents, without needing to know the specific functional relationships.

- Unknown functional dependencies: When some variables are known to be functionally determined by their parents but the specific functional relationships are unknown. 

- Functional elimination: An operation for removing functional variables from a causal graph while preserving key properties like D-separation.

- Functional projection: A refinement of the classical causal graph projection operation that integrates knowledge about unknown functional dependencies.

- Identifying formula: A formula that can uniquely compute a causal effect from the observational distribution, implying the causal effect is identifiable.  

- Minimal identifying set: A smallest subset of variables that need to be observed to render a particular causal effect identifiable. Knowledge of functional dependencies can sometimes reduce the size of minimal identifying sets.

So in summary, the key focus is on exploiting knowledge about unknown functional dependencies to address problems related to identifying causal effects from observational and experimental data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces the concept of "functional identifiability". How is this related to and different from traditional identifiability? What additional assumptions or knowledge does it rely on?

2) What is the motivation behind proposing functional identifiability? What problems does it aim to address that traditional identifiability methods cannot? 

3) Explain in detail the functional elimination operation. How does it differ from standard variable elimination techniques? What key properties does it preserve that are important for identifiability?

4) Walk through an example that shows a causal effect that is not traditionally identifiable but becomes functionally identifiable. Explain step-by-step why this is the case.  

5) The paper proposes functional projection as a refinement of classical projection in the context of unknown functional dependencies. Explain what functional projection is, how it differs from classical projection, and what additional independencies it is able to capture.  

6) Theorem 3 shows that functional projection preserves D-separations while classical projection only preserves d-separations. Explain the difference between D-separation and d-separation and why this result is important.

7) The paper shows that the classical project-ID method for testing identifiability is not complete in the presence of unknown functional dependencies. Explain what the project-ID method is, why it fails under functional dependencies, and how the proposed approach addresses this.

8) Discuss the subtleties that arise when some functional variables are observed versus when all functional variables are hidden, in terms of testing for functional identifiability. 

9) Explain the proposed method for reducing functional identifiability to classical identifiability in the single treatment variable case. What is the caveat associated with this reduction?

10) Minimal identifying sets aim to find the smallest sufficient variable set for identifiability. Explain why knowing certain variables are functional can help reduce the size of minimal identifying sets and discuss the practical utility of this.
