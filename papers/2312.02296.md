# [LLMs Accelerate Annotation for Medical Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02296)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical NLP models require large amounts of labeled data for training, but manual annotation by human experts is time-consuming and expensive. This is a major bottleneck.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with human expertise to accelerate the annotation process for medical text. 
- The method has two steps:
   1) The LLM generates initial "Base Annotations" using prompt engineering and few-shot learning.
   2) Human experts refine these base annotations to produce high-quality "Refined Annotations".

- This combines the generative power and efficiency of LLMs with the accuracy of human experts.

Experiment:
- Evaluate method on medication extraction task using 2009 i2b2 medical dataset.
- Compare annotation time and quality against standard human-only workflow. 
- Measure efficiency gains and quality metrics like precision, recall and F1 score.

Key Results:
- LLM-assisted method reduces total annotation time by 58% on average.
- Quality of refined annotations is comparable between LLM+human vs human-only workflows.
- For expert raters, LLM-method improves efficiency by 26% while maintaining quality.
- Accuracy converges after refinement phase regardless of source of base annotations.

Main Contributions:
1) Demonstrate utility of LLMs to accelerate medical text annotation.
2) Present efficient method combining LLMs and human experts.
3) Reduce annotation burden while preserving quality.
4) Quantify significant time savings from using approach.
5) Provide labeled dataset for medication extraction on public corpus.

The paper establishes LLMs as an effective tool to streamline annotation in medical NLP, enabling rapid development of high-quality models to unlock insights from clinical texts.
