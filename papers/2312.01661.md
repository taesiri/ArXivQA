# [ChatGPT as a Math Questioner? Evaluating ChatGPT on Generating   Pre-university Math Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01661)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth analysis evaluating the capabilities of ChatGPT for automatically generating pre-university level math questions. The authors categorize the evaluation into context-aware settings, where background context is provided, and context-unaware settings without context. In the context-aware analysis, while ChatGPT generates highly grammatical and relevant questions, it struggles with question difficulty and answerability without an expected answer. To enable exhaustive context-unaware analysis, the authors collect a novel dataset, PRE-UMATH, consisting of expert-authored curriculums spanning 121 math topics and 428 lessons. Through evaluation on PRE-UMATH, they find ChatGPT can generate diverse real-life scenarios connecting other subjects, but sometimes misinterprets concepts or generates questions unrelated to provided topics. Additionally, ChatGPT tends to replicate demonstration difficulty despite prompts for higher complexity. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into leveraging large language models like ChatGPT for math question generation, advancing AI applications in education.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical questioning is important for assessing students' problem-solving abilities, but manually creating such questions is time-consuming and not scalable. 
- Existing automatic math question generation models rely on fine-tuning strategies and struggle with generating multi-step, logical reasoning questions.  
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT show promise for logical reasoning tasks but their potential for educational question generation is under-explored.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of ChatGPT's capabilities for generating pre-university level math questions.
- Evaluate in two settings: (1) context-aware (given background context) and (2) context-unaware (no context provided).
- For context-aware, assess on math QA benchmarks from elementary to tertiary levels.  
- For context-unaware, create PRE-UMATH, a novel dataset covering 121 math topics and 428 lessons from grade 1 to tertiary. Use this to comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT's math question generation across topics/lessons.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of using ChatGPT to generate pre-university math questions.
- Study two main settings for math question generation: context-aware and context-unaware.
- Contribute PRE-UMATH, an expert-authored collection of pre-university math curricula and 16K QA pairs.
- Provide 11 key findings evaluating ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations as a math question generator. 
- Offer insights for teachers and researchers on using modern AI like ChatGPT to generate educational questions.
