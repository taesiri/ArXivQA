# [ChatGPT as a Math Questioner? Evaluating ChatGPT on Generating   Pre-university Math Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01661)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth analysis evaluating the capabilities of ChatGPT for automatically generating pre-university level math questions. The authors categorize the evaluation into context-aware settings, where background context is provided, and context-unaware settings without context. In the context-aware analysis, while ChatGPT generates highly grammatical and relevant questions, it struggles with question difficulty and answerability without an expected answer. To enable exhaustive context-unaware analysis, the authors collect a novel dataset, PRE-UMATH, consisting of expert-authored curriculums spanning 121 math topics and 428 lessons. Through evaluation on PRE-UMATH, they find ChatGPT can generate diverse real-life scenarios connecting other subjects, but sometimes misinterprets concepts or generates questions unrelated to provided topics. Additionally, ChatGPT tends to replicate demonstration difficulty despite prompts for higher complexity. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into leveraging large language models like ChatGPT for math question generation, advancing AI applications in education.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical questioning is important for assessing students' problem-solving abilities, but manually creating such questions is time-consuming and not scalable. 
- Existing automatic math question generation models rely on fine-tuning strategies and struggle with generating multi-step, logical reasoning questions.  
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT show promise for logical reasoning tasks but their potential for educational question generation is under-explored.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of ChatGPT's capabilities for generating pre-university level math questions.
- Evaluate in two settings: (1) context-aware (given background context) and (2) context-unaware (no context provided).
- For context-aware, assess on math QA benchmarks from elementary to tertiary levels.  
- For context-unaware, create PRE-UMATH, a novel dataset covering 121 math topics and 428 lessons from grade 1 to tertiary. Use this to comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT's math question generation across topics/lessons.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of using ChatGPT to generate pre-university math questions.
- Study two main settings for math question generation: context-aware and context-unaware.
- Contribute PRE-UMATH, an expert-authored collection of pre-university math curricula and 16K QA pairs.
- Provide 11 key findings evaluating ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations as a math question generator. 
- Offer insights for teachers and researchers on using modern AI like ChatGPT to generate educational questions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two main settings for evaluating ChatGPT's capability in generating math questions: context-aware and context-unaware. Can you explain the key differences between these two settings and why evaluating both scenarios provides a more comprehensive analysis?  

2. In the context-unaware setting, the authors collect expert-authored math curriculums covering 121 topics and 428 lessons across elementary to tertiary levels. What was the rationale behind curating such an extensive set of materials for evaluating ChatGPT, instead of just using a few existing math question datasets?

3. The paper finds that when provided an expected answer, ChatGPT tends to generate more answerable questions compared to having no answer input. What might be some reasons for this behavior? How could the model potentially be improved to generate substantive answerable questions without an expected answer?  

4. One interesting finding is that ChatGPT struggles to create questions with difficulty levels exceeding the provided demonstration question, often just replicating the demo. Why do you think this limitation occurs, and how can it be addressed?

5. Although quite infrequent, the analysis reveals cases where ChatGPT misunderstands complex concepts and generates simpler or more familiar questions. What techniques could help the model better comprehend advanced mathematical concepts and semantics?  

6. When attempting to generate complex multi-step questions, ChatGPT sometimes produces nonsense with many unrelated variables or geometric entities. What underlying issues might cause this, and how can the coherence of complex generated questions be improved?

7. The paper introduces several constraints and strategies when prompting ChatGPT to generate questions, such as word limits, tense matching, and token diversity requirements. Why are these important, and how do they improve the quality of questions generated?

8. One limitation revealed is that without an expected answer, ChatGPT tends to produce trivial questions by just repeating context information. What changes could be made to the prompting approach or model architecture to promote more creative questions?

9. The paper finds cases where ChatGPT struggles to comprehend relationships between mathematical objects when formulating questions. How might advanced mathematical reasoning be incorporated into large language models to address this?

10. The analysis employs both automatic metrics and human evaluation to assess the quality of generated math questions. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two evaluation approaches? Which provides a more accurate measure of question quality?
