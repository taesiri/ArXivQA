# [ChatGPT as a Math Questioner? Evaluating ChatGPT on Generating   Pre-university Math Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01661)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth analysis evaluating the capabilities of ChatGPT for automatically generating pre-university level math questions. The authors categorize the evaluation into context-aware settings, where background context is provided, and context-unaware settings without context. In the context-aware analysis, while ChatGPT generates highly grammatical and relevant questions, it struggles with question difficulty and answerability without an expected answer. To enable exhaustive context-unaware analysis, the authors collect a novel dataset, PRE-UMATH, consisting of expert-authored curriculums spanning 121 math topics and 428 lessons. Through evaluation on PRE-UMATH, they find ChatGPT can generate diverse real-life scenarios connecting other subjects, but sometimes misinterprets concepts or generates questions unrelated to provided topics. Additionally, ChatGPT tends to replicate demonstration difficulty despite prompts for higher complexity. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into leveraging large language models like ChatGPT for math question generation, advancing AI applications in education.
