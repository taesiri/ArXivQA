# [Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Keyphrase Extractor: A Preliminary   Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15156)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Keyphrase extraction aims to automatically extract important phrases from documents to generate structured summaries. However, most methods require training data which is expensive to obtain. 

- Recent large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT show promise for zero-shot performance without training, thus the authors explore using ChatGPT for keyphrase extraction without any training.

Method:
- The authors simply provide ChatGPT two alternative prompt templates to extract keyphrases from input documents.

- They compare ChatGPT to various unsupervised baselines like TF-IDF, TextRank, etc. and supervised models like HyperMatch, KIEMP on 4 datasets - Inspec, DUC2001, SemEval2010, OpenKP.

Results:
- ChatGPT achieves comparable performance to TF-IDF and far surpasses TextRank, but lags behind supervised models, showing room for improvement.

- On the SemEval2010 dataset of long documents, ChatGPT's performance is significantly better, showing its ability to understand long documents.

- A few sample prompts and conversations with ChatGPT are provided to showcase the keyphrase extraction.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring the zero-shot ability of ChatGPT for keyphrase extraction without any training data.

- Analysis and empirical comparison of ChatGPT with 20+ unsupervised and supervised keyphrase extraction methods over multiple datasets. 

- Showcases the potential as well as current limitations of using large language models like ChatGPT for keyphrase extraction.

- Discusses future opportunities like incorporating external knowledge and fine-tuning ChatGPT to further improve quality of extracted keyphrases.
