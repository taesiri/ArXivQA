# [HKD-SHO: A hybrid smart home system based on knowledge-based and   data-driven services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15521)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for creating smart home services have limitations. Knowledge-based approaches require manual input from users to create services and the services are static. Machine learning approaches like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) adapt to changing conditions but act like black boxes without explainability.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a hybrid system called HKD-SHO that integrates knowledge-based and DRL-based data-driven services. 
- It combines the advantages of both approaches - the explicability of knowledge-based services and the dynamism of DRL services.
- Rules are automatically extracted from the DRL agent using a proposed variant of the PBRE algorithm to enrich the knowledge base. The rules help explain when the DRL agent takes certain actions.

Components of HKD-SHO:
- Knowledge representation module: Ontology and rules database
- Rule management module: Extracts and deletes rules  
- State proposition module: Reasoners for existing rules, DRL agent, extracted rules
- Decision maker module: Selects final actuator states  

Working Process:
- At each timestep, environment states are updated in the knowledge representation
- Existing rules, DRL agent, extracted rules propose actuator states 
- Decision maker selects the final states
- Rewards determine if rules should be extracted or deleted
- DRL agent is updated based on environment transitions

Main Contributions:
- Novel hybrid system for smart home services combining advantages of knowledge-based and DRL approaches  
- Automatic rule extraction from DRL to enable explainability
- Enrichment of knowledge base through extracted rules
- Evaluation showing proposed HKD-SHO outperforms standalone knowledge-based, DRL, and random approaches

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, proposed hybrid solution, components and working process of HKD-SHO system, and highlights the main contributions of enriched knowledge and explainability through rule extraction.
