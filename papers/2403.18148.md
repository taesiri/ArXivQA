# [Large Language Models Produce Responses Perceived to be Empathic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to provide empathic responses, such as for mental health support. However, few studies have systematically looked at whether LLM responses are actually perceived as empathic by people. 
- Prior work focused on narrow domains like medical advice or used a limited set of models. This paper aims to address these gaps by studying perceived empathy of LLM responses across everyday situations and multiple models.

Methods:
- The authors conducted two studies with hundreds of human raters from Prolific evaluating LLM-generated responses.
- In Study 1, raters evaluated responses from GPT4, Llama2, Mistral on 15 Reddit posts across parenting, relationships and workplace domains. Responses were compared to human-written responses. 
- In Study 2, the same models responded to 120 Reddit posts across six domains. Only LLM responses were evaluated.
- Raters used 5-point Likert scales to assess how empathic each response was. Linguistic analysis was also conducted.

Key Findings:
- Across both studies, LLM responses were consistently rated as more empathic than human responses.
- In study 2, GPT4 and Llama2 were rated as most empathic, followed by Mistral.  
- Linguistic analysis revealed LLMs have distinct response "styles." Llama2 was more casual, Mistral more apologetic.
- Features like emojis were predictive of higher empathy ratings.

Implications:
- The results suggest modern LLMs can produce highly empathic responses to support seekers in everyday contexts.
- There is potential for LLMs to complement human support and empathy at scale.
- More work is still needed on risks, ethics, bias, and long-term conversational capabilities.

In summary, this well-designed paper demonstrates that LLMs display surprisingly empathic text responses across a range of everyday situations. The results open up new possibilities for LLMs to assist with providing social and emotional support.
