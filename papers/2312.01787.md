# [Developing Linguistic Patterns to Mitigate Inherent Human Bias in   Offensive Language Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01787)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a linguistic data augmentation approach to mitigate human bias in offensive language detection datasets. The authors utilize linguistic features to automatically identify and extract offensive tweets, balancing the typically skewed class distributions in such datasets. Evaluated on Turkish and English datasets, this method improved model recall on offensive classes by 17.46% and 8.1% respectively over baseline. Comparative analyses between statistical (Word2Vec) and contextual (BERT) embeddings demonstrated superior performance by BERT models. Additionally, deep learning models (BERT-CNN-BiLSTM) outperformed traditional machine learning (SVM) in capturing nuanced expressions. While text normalization boosted statistical model scores, it degraded contextual model performance, indicating the importance of an unaltered linguistic context. By enhancing diversity and representativeness in training data, this linguistic augmentation technique reduces model reliance on biased human judgment and enhances generalization across contextual variations. Applicable across languages, it is an effective strategy to develop fairer natural language technologies. The authors suggest further augmenting data with positive context to build more holistic models less prone to biased inferences. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into mitigating bias in sentiment analysis datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a linguistic data augmentation approach to reduce human bias in offensive language detection datasets by automatically extracting contextual offensive content, enabling improvements in model performance and fairness across languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a linguistic data augmentation approach to reduce human bias in offensive language detection datasets. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a methodology to leverage linguistic features to isolate offensive content from an unlabeled corpus. This allows for augmenting imbalanced offensive language datasets to ensure more balanced representation across different classes.

- The efficacy of this linguistic augmentation approach is evaluated on both Turkish and English offensive language detection datasets. Experiments show improved performance of models trained on the augmented datasets compared to original imbalanced datasets.

- The paper demonstrates that this linguistic data augmentation approach can help improve offensive language classification performance across multiple languages. It also has the potential to reduce the influence of human bias and inaccuracies in the labeling process.

- The study provides comparative analysis between different word embeddings (Word2Vec vs BERT) and machine learning models (SVM vs CNN-BiLSTM) when used in conjunction with the augmented datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting and evaluating a cross-lingual data augmentation technique relying on linguistic features to address class imbalance and human bias, which are common issues plaguing offensive language detection datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the linguistic data augmentation method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using linguistic features to isolate offensive content from an unlabeled corpus. Can you expand on what specific linguistic features were used and how they were identified as being effective for this task?

2. The paper states that maintaining the natural flow and spontaneity of sentences is essential when augmenting offensive language datasets. Why is this important and how did the proposed approach aim to achieve this? 

3. The paper evaluates the proposed method on both Turkish and English datasets. What modifications or adaptations, if any, had to be made to apply the method cross-linguistically? How does this demonstrate the versatility of the approach?

4. Explain the intuition behind using different arrangements of offensive words, pronouns, and entities (e.g. loose order vs strict order) for querying English tweets. What key observations did this analysis reveal? 

5. The paper argues recall is more important than precision for offensive language detection. Explain why this is the case and how the proposed method reflects this focus, including the trade-offs involved.  

6. Error analysis is provided for both the Turkish and English datasets. Summarize 1-2 key challenges or limitations that emerge from these examples of misclassifications.  

7. The discussion section mentions our approach can help reduce errors in the labeling process. Elaborate on how this could occur and why it is an important potential benefit.

8. What suggestions are provided in the discussion to further improve the augmented datasets? Explain one of these suggestions in detail.  

9. The paper evaluates both statistical (Word2Vec) and contextual (BERT) word embeddings. Summarize the key differences in performance and effects of text normalization observed between these approaches.

10. The conclusion states that shifting the metric focus from F1 to recall better suits real-life usage for offensive language detection. Justify this statement with an example use case that would benefit from higher recall.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive language and content is proliferating on social media, exacerbating issues like racism, sexism, and hatred towards vulnerable groups. Detecting such content accurately remains challenging. 
- Manually creating labeled datasets for training deep learning models is expensive and prone to human biases. Existing offensive language datasets have issues like imbalanced class distribution, mislabeled examples, and embedded racial/stereotypical biases.
- Language models trained on such biased data perpetuate and amplify those biases, leading to discrimination. Addressing bias in data and models is critical.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a linguistic data augmentation approach to extract additional offensive examples from unlabeled corpora in Turkish and English based on combinations of offensive words, pronouns and targeted entities. 
- This allows enhancing diversity of offensive contexts in imbalanced datasets and mitigating effects of human bias in labeling.
- The efficacy of this semi-automated data collection process is evaluated on offensive language detection in Turkish and English tweets.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates a linguistics-based data augmentation technique to supplement imbalanced datasets using contextual language features.
- Reduces effects of human bias in labeling using semi-automated expansion of offensive language samples.  
- Improves model performance, especially recall of minority offensive class, in both Turkish and English datasets.
- Provides generalized approach that works across multiple languages.
- Compares multiple word embeddings, models and effect of text normalization, offering useful insights.
- Brings multidisciplinary perspective spanning linguistics, psychology and machine learning to address bias in models.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in developing linguistic data augmentation solutions that can mitigate human biases in offensive language detection tasks for underrepresented contexts across languages.
