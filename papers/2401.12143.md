# [Anisotropy Is Inherent to Self-Attention in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12143)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Transformers-based models across modalities (NLP, vision, speech) commonly suffer from representation anisotropy, where hidden representations are unexpectedly close to each other in angular distance (high cosine similarity)
- Prior work hypothesizes this is due to optimizing cross-entropy loss on long-tailed token distributions, but the root causes remain unclear

Contributions
1. Empirically demonstrate anisotropy exists even in character-based NLP models not directly affected by subword distribution issues, and in Transformers trained on vision/speech data, suggesting it is an inherent issue not just caused by linguistic properties

2. Study untrained Transformer blocks and show biased inputs increase attention score variance and facilitate sharp patterns, hinting that anisotropy may help models form strong attention maps 

3. Analyze query/key vector dynamics during BERT pre-training and find their average representations drift in aligned directions, increasing the magnitude of scalar products and enabling sharper attention patterns 

4. Conclude that anisotropy systematically affects Transformers as an inherent way for models to produce strong attention patterns, rather than just being caused by long-tailed token distributions

Proposed Future Work
- Architectures that can easily form sharp attention patterns without distorting geometry of latent spaces
- Pre-training objectives that do not introduce anisotropy in the first place

In summary, the key insight is that anisotropy emerges from the architecture and objectives of Transformers, not just the data distribution, manifesting as a way for the model to produce strong attention patterns. This suggests avenues for developing new architectures and training procedures that can achieve strong attention while maintaining isotropic representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper argues that anisotropy (the property of hidden representations that makes them surprisingly close to each other) appears to be an inherent issue arising from the use of self-attention in Transformers across modalities, rather than just a consequence of the cross-entropy loss or data distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper demonstrates empirically that anisotropy can be observed in language models with character-aware architectures, not just in token-based models. This suggests anisotropy cannot be explained solely by linguistic properties like subword token distributions.

2) The paper extends observations of anisotropy to Transformers trained on modalities beyond language, like image, audio, and speech data. This further supports that anisotropy is not just caused by properties of natural language data. 

3) The paper analyzes untrained Transformer layers and shows they have an intrinsic tendency towards anisotropy when representations drift away from the origin. The analysis suggests a connection between anisotropy and sharp self-attention patterns.

4) The paper explores the training dynamics of query and key representations in self-attention. It finds these representations drift in aligned directions, maximizing attention scores. This facilitates sharp attention patterns but increases anisotropy.

In summary, the main contribution is providing extensive empirical evidence to suggest anisotropy is an inherent property of Transformers, rather than just being caused by factors like subword distributions or training objectives. The paper correlates anisotropy with the emergence of sharp self-attention patterns in the architecture.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Anisotropy - The phenomenon where hidden representations in Transformers models are unexpectedly close to each other in terms of angular distance/cosine similarity. 

- Representation degeneration - The general phenomenon where hidden representations in self-supervised models lose desirable properties like isotropy.

- Drift effect - The observation that representations tend to drift in a shared direction, causing anisotropy.

- Self-attention - The key mechanism in the Transformer architecture, which the authors analyze to study the causes of anisotropy.

- Queries and keys (Q and K) - The representations used in self-attention. The authors study how their distributions change during training.

- Sharpness - Used to refer to the entropy levels of self-attention distributions. Training pushes them to be less entropic.

- Character-based models - Used to study if anisotropy extends beyond subword tokenization.

- Vision and speech models - Also analyzed to see if anisotropy exists in other modalities beyond NLP.

So in summary, key terms revolve around anisotropy, the Transformer self-attention, analyzing model representations during training, and extending studies across modalities and architectures.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that anisotropy is inherent in Transformers and not just caused by properties of the training data. What evidence do they provide to support this claim? How compelling is this evidence?

2. The paper studies anisotropy in character-based language models that do not suffer from out-of-vocabulary token distributions. What specifically do they analyze and what do they find? What are the implications? 

3. The paper analyzes anisotropy in Transformers trained on modalities beyond language, like speech and vision. What models do they study and what trends do they uncover across modalities? What does this suggest about the underlying causes of anisotropy?

4. The paper explores the behavior of an untrained Transformer block with biased input representations. What properties do they analyze and how does added bias affect mechanisms like attention scores and query/key vectors? What does this reveal?

5. The paper tracks the training dynamics of query and key representations over time. How do the distributions of queries and keys change and align? How does this alignment facilitate emergence of sharp attention patterns?  

6. The paper argues drift anisotropy helps Transformers form sharp attention distributions. Could isotropic architectures also create sharp attention while avoiding distortion? What alternatives could avoid inherent anisotropy?

7. Is anisotropy definitively harmful for model performance? What evidence exists on both sides? Does the paper settle this question or what still remains unclear?

8. How compelling is the evidence that anisotropy enables strong attention? Are there limitations to their arguments or analyses? What is missing to make a more definitive claim? 

9. Could the analysis methods such as SVD projections favor the paper's argument on aligned query/key drifts? How could analysis be strengthened to overcome possible weaknesses?

10. The paper hypothesizes a "fixed point" balance between bias norm and output representation norm. What is the evidence for this? If true, what mechanisms might enforce this fixed point and stabilize norms?
