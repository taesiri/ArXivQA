# [Sub-sampling of NMR Correlation and Exchange Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sub-sampling NMR signals from correlation/exchange experiments (like T1-D) can significantly reduce acquisition times, but may introduce artifacts during signal inversion to obtain the underlying distributions. 
- The paper evaluates different sub-sampling methods and inversion algorithms to identify optimal combinations that maximize time savings while preserving inversion quality.

Methods:
- Simulated T1-D signals with different levels of sparsity, sampled to different degrees using random sampling, truncation, or a combined approach.
- Inverted the sub-sampled signals using Tikhonov regularization, MTGV regularization, deep learning, or Tikhonov + deep learning. 
- Evaluated inversion performance using two ranking metrics - one focused on reconstruction fidelity ($\chi$-score) and one focused on suppressing artifacts ($\phi$-score).

Key Results:
- Fully-sampled signals: Deep learning significantly outperforms other methods. All methods perform worse on smooth distributions.  
- Sub-sampled signals: Random sampling preserves performance the best across methods. Truncation performs very poorly.
- High sub-sampling rates deteriorate performance, especially for deep learning. Likely due to reduced dynamic range.
- Ranking metrics impact relative performance - Tikhonov+deep learning ranks best for artifact suppression.

Main Conclusions:
- Random sampling is optimal for sub-sampling NMR signals prior to inversion.
- Deep learning provides the overall best inversions quality when signals are sampled to a sufficient degree.
- Choice of inversion method depends on experimental objectives - Tikhonov+deep learning best suppresses artifacts.
- Always sample full dynamic range of signal decay for best inversion performance.
