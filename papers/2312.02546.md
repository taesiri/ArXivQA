# [Machine Vision Therapy: Multimodal Large Language Models Can Enhance   Visual Robustness via Denoising In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02546)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Machine Vision Therapy (MVT) framework to enhance the robustness of computer vision models on out-of-distribution tasks without needing additional human annotations. The key idea is to leverage the knowledge embedded within Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that possess exceptional few-shot learning capabilities and reasoning skills about visual concepts. To align the text generation process of MLLMs with vision tasks, the authors design a Denoising In-Context Learning strategy. Specifically, by estimating a transition matrix capturing label noise, an instruction is constructed containing a correct and an erroneous visual example from the most probable confusing category. When fed into MLLMs, such an instruction helps detect and rectify incorrect predictions. The rectified supervision then guides a self-supervised fine-tuning to boost vision models' robustness on downstream distributions. Through comprehensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed etc., the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Machine Vision Therapy in improving performance under distribution shifts and on corrupted images, showing superiority over several baseline methods. The work provides a novel perspective to exploit MLLMs for enhancing vision models without human effort.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It proposes a novel Machine Vision Therapy (MVT) paradigm to enhance computer vision models by effectively leveraging the knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) without needing additional label information. 

2. It develops a new Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to successfully align MLLMs with vision tasks. Specifically, by estimating a transition matrix and constructing instructions with positive and negative exemplars, MLLMs can help diagnose and rectify incorrect predictions from vision models.

3. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies on many well-known datasets, it demonstrates that the proposed method can significantly boost the performance of vision models under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) circumstances.

In summary, the key innovation is using MLLMs to conduct therapy on vision models to improve their robustness, enabled by the proposed DICL strategy to bridge MLLMs and vision tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of this new Machine Vision Therapy paradigm.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Machine Vision Therapy: Multimodal Large Language Models Can Enhance Visual Robustness via Denoising In-Context Learning":

Problem:
Vision models pre-trained with contrastive language-image approaches like CLIP show impressive generalization performance, but their zero-shot robustness is still limited under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios without fine-tuning. Fine-tuning requires additional human-annotated data, which is undesirable. On the other hand, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown powerful visual understanding and few-shot learning capabilities, but struggle to match the performance of dominant vision models on vision tasks due to task alignment issues.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Machine Vision Therapy (MVT) framework to enhance vision models by leveraging MLLMs without needing additional labels. It aligns MLLMs with vision tasks through a novel Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy. A transition matrix is estimated to capture label noise and find probable noisy classes. DICL is then conducted by constructing an instruction with a positive and a negative exemplar from the noisy classes to help the MLLM rectify incorrect predictions. The rectified predictions are used to fine-tune the vision model.

Main Contributions:
- A new Machine Vision Therapy paradigm to improve vision models using MLLMs without extra supervision by humans
- A Denoising In-Context Learning strategy to align MLLMs with vision tasks by estimating label noise and constructing exemplar-based instructions
- Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed etc. showing quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of the method to boost robustness over state-of-the-art vision models

The key insight is to leverage MLLMs' reasoning skills to find and correct errors made by vision models based on language instructions with positive/negative exemplars. This alignment allows improving vision models without human labeling through machine teaching.
