# [PAC-FNO: Parallel-Structured All-Component Fourier Neural Operators for   Recognizing Low-Quality Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12721)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for visual recognition are typically trained on images of a fixed resolution, but at test time they often encounter varying input resolutions or other input degradations like weather/lighting changes or compression artifacts.
- There is a need for methods that can handle such varying real-world inputs within a single model. Prior work handles resolution changes or input degradations separately, with multiple models.

Proposed Solution: 
- Authors propose Parallel-structured and All-component Fourier Neural Operators (PAC-FNO) which operate in frequency domain to handle input images in various resolutions and input variations in a unified way.

- PAC-FNO consists of multiple parallel blocks called AC-FNO, which process input in frequency domain without the low-pass filters traditionally used in Fourier Neural Operators. This retains high-frequency information relevant for image classification.

- PAC-FNO can be attached to existing ConvNet or Vision Transformer models and jointly trained with two-stage algorithm. In stage 1, PAC-FNO is trained on target resolution images. In stage 2, both low and high resolution images are used.

Main Contributions:

- PAC-FNO is the first method to handle low resolution and natural input variations together within single model. It also minimizes modifications to downstream model. 

- Parallel architecture of PAC-FNO blocks helps encode multiple input frequencies and resolutions more effectively than prior FNO architectures.

- Extensive evaluation on 7 classification benchmarks shows state-of-the-art performance of PAC-FNO. Up to 77% accuracy improvements for low-res inputs vs resizing baselines. Also more robust to 19 types of corruptions.

- Easy to integrate PAC-FNO with existing ConvNet and Vision Transformer models with minimal parameter overhead. Achieves unified handling of multi-resolution and corrupted images.
