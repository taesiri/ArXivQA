# [RoCoIns: Enhancing Robustness of Large Language Models through   Code-Style Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) show impressive capabilities in following human instructions, but recent studies reveal vulnerabilities to textual adversarial attacks. By inserting slight perturbations into inputs, the model outputs can substantially deviate from expected results. 
- Existing defense methods require model parameter updates, which is infeasible for "closed source black-box" commercial LLMs where only APIs are accessible. 
- Typical instructions use natural language, but its ambiguity makes LLMs extremely sensitive even to small modifications in prompts. This sensitivity likely worsens with adversarial inputs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce RoCoIns to enhance robustness through code-style instructions instead of natural language prompts. 
- Convert task instructions from natural language to Python class-style pseudo-code format, containing key components like class name, annotations, initialization functions, and implementation functions. This code format has advantages of being more structured and less ambiguous.
- Also propose an "adversarial context method" where both clean and adversarial examples are used to compose the few-shot in-context learning demonstrations. This acts as implicit adversarial training to further improve robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Propose RoCoIns method to enhance robustness of commercial LLMs using code-style instructions, overcoming limitations of natural language ambiguity and black-box model restrictions.
- Introduce adversarial context method for composing demonstrations with both clean and attacked samples to mimic adversarial training.  
- Evaluate method on 8 robustness tasks and achieve average 5.66 point decrease in Attack Success Rate with state-of-the-art LLM. Outperforms natural language baselines.
- Provide analysis on code format advantages over language via perplexity, attention visualization, and robustness to instruction modifications.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution in improving robustness for black-box LLMs by carefully transforming the prompt style and learning context. The gains highlight inherent benefits of code structure and opportunities to implicitly train models through prompt design.
