# [Generative AI meets 3D: A Survey on Text-to-3D in AIGC Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06131)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality 3D models from just text descriptions, without relying on large paired text-3D datasets? The key points are:- Text-to-image synthesis has made great progress recently thanks to large text-image datasets and advances in deep learning. However, text-to-3D is more challenging due to the lack of large paired text-3D datasets and the complexity of 3D data representations. - Recent works have shown promising results in text-to-3D generation by leveraging powerful pre-trained text-to-image models as priors during 3D optimization.- The paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent advances in text-to-3D generation enabled by text-to-image priors. It reviews the data representations, foundation technologies, successful attempts, applications, and discusses challenges and future directions.In summary, the central hypothesis is that text-to-3D generation can be achieved by utilizing text-to-image models as strong priors to guide the optimization of 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields, despite the lack of large text-3D datasets. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of this emerging research direction.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving fidelity of generated 3D assets: The authors note issues with weakly supervised training and low resolution from CLIP, resulting in imperfect upscaled results. They suggest exploring ways to improve fidelity while balancing speed/efficiency tradeoffs. - Accelerating inference speed: The authors highlight the very slow inference times of current text-to-3D methods, especially at higher resolutions. Reducing inference time while maintaining quality is noted as an important direction.- Enhancing 3D consistency: The "Janus face" issue of distortion across views is discussed. The authors suggest exploring techniques to improve consistency and reduce distortion in generated 3D scenes.- Increasing controllability: Lack of control over associating semantics to 3D structures is noted. Integrating shape/layout guidance and exploring more intuitive interfaces like sketching are suggested to improve controllability.- Expanding applicability: Converting neural representations like NeRFs into industrial formats like meshes and point clouds is noted as important for applications. Integrating NeRFs with other representations for efficiency and realism is suggested.- Incorporating more guidance modalities: The authors suggest moving beyond pure text-guided generation to include other intuitive guidance like sketches. This could increase control and applicability.- Developing task-specific models: Exploring models tailored to specific tasks like avatar or texture generation, rather than generic text-to-3D, is noted as a potential direction.In summary, the key future directions relate to improving fidelity, speed, consistency, controllability, applicability, incorporating richer guidance, and developing specialized models for text-to-3D generation. The survey provides a good overview of the open challenges and opportunities in this emerging research area.
