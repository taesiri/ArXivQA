# [Generative AI meets 3D: A Survey on Text-to-3D in AIGC Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06131)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality 3D models from just text descriptions, without relying on large paired text-3D datasets? 

The key points are:

- Text-to-image synthesis has made great progress recently thanks to large text-image datasets and advances in deep learning. However, text-to-3D is more challenging due to the lack of large paired text-3D datasets and the complexity of 3D data representations. 

- Recent works have shown promising results in text-to-3D generation by leveraging powerful pre-trained text-to-image models as priors during 3D optimization.

- The paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent advances in text-to-3D generation enabled by text-to-image priors. It reviews the data representations, foundation technologies, successful attempts, applications, and discusses challenges and future directions.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that text-to-3D generation can be achieved by utilizing text-to-image models as strong priors to guide the optimization of 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields, despite the lack of large text-3D datasets. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of this emerging research direction.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving fidelity of generated 3D assets: The authors note issues with weakly supervised training and low resolution from CLIP, resulting in imperfect upscaled results. They suggest exploring ways to improve fidelity while balancing speed/efficiency tradeoffs. 

- Accelerating inference speed: The authors highlight the very slow inference times of current text-to-3D methods, especially at higher resolutions. Reducing inference time while maintaining quality is noted as an important direction.

- Enhancing 3D consistency: The "Janus face" issue of distortion across views is discussed. The authors suggest exploring techniques to improve consistency and reduce distortion in generated 3D scenes.

- Increasing controllability: Lack of control over associating semantics to 3D structures is noted. Integrating shape/layout guidance and exploring more intuitive interfaces like sketching are suggested to improve controllability.

- Expanding applicability: Converting neural representations like NeRFs into industrial formats like meshes and point clouds is noted as important for applications. Integrating NeRFs with other representations for efficiency and realism is suggested.

- Incorporating more guidance modalities: The authors suggest moving beyond pure text-guided generation to include other intuitive guidance like sketches. This could increase control and applicability.

- Developing task-specific models: Exploring models tailored to specific tasks like avatar or texture generation, rather than generic text-to-3D, is noted as a potential direction.

In summary, the key future directions relate to improving fidelity, speed, consistency, controllability, applicability, incorporating richer guidance, and developing specialized models for text-to-3D generation. The survey provides a good overview of the open challenges and opportunities in this emerging research area.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for text-to-3D generation that leverages powerful pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as strong image priors. The key insight is that large-scale text-image datasets can provide useful guidance for 3D shape optimization even without 3D supervision. Specifically, the method represents 3D scenes as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) initialized randomly for each text prompt. It then optimizes the NeRF parameters to match the text description by minimizing a loss function based on score-based denoising diffusion models (DDPMs). More concretely, during each optimization iteration, the method renders NeRF images from random viewpoints, computes DDPM loss gradients w.r.t the rendered images, and updates the NeRF parameters accordingly. By combining adaptive sampling and a perceptual DDPM loss, the framework can synthesize 3D shapes with high fidelity and consistency from text prompts, without requiring any text-3D shape pairs for training. The main advantage is the ability to leverage powerful pre-trained image generative models to guide 3D shape modeling in a zero-shot manner.
