# [SeGA: Preference-Aware Self-Contrastive Learning with Prompts for   Anomalous User Detection on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Detecting anomalous Twitter users like bots and trolls is crucial to address issues like misinformation and cyberbullying. Existing methods focus only on detecting bots and fail to capture subtle differences between various types of users. As the variety of anomalous users increases, they are better able to mimic normal users and evade detection.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SeGA, a preference-aware self-contrastive learning approach for detecting anomalous Twitter users including bots and trolls. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a heterogeneous graph with users, lists and their relations to model diverse user activities. 

2) Summarize user preferences (topics and emotions) from posts using language models. Create pseudo-labels from most and least common preferences for self-contrastive learning.

3) Pre-train encoder using preference-aware self-contrastive loss to discern subtle user differences based on preferences. Fine-tune for anomaly detection.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose SeGA framework to jointly detect bots, trolls and normal users by modeling user preferences.

2) Introduce preference-aware self-contrastive learning with pseudo-labels from language models to learn subtle user differences.

3) Construct TwBNT dataset with bots, trolls and normal users for evaluation.

4) Extensive experiments show SeGA outperforms state-of-the-art by 3.5-27.6%, demonstrating effectiveness.

The key novelty is using self-supervision with user preferences from posts to distinguish between bots, trolls and normal users more effectively. The pre-training strategy and preference-based contrastive learning allow capturing subtle differences in user behavior.
