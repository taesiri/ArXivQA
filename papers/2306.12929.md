# [Quantizable Transformers: Removing Outliers by Helping Attention Heads   Do Nothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12929)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we modify the architecture of transformers to prevent them from learning strong activation outliers during pre-training, in order to make the networks easier to quantize for efficient inference without degradation in accuracy?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) The outliers occur because some attention heads are trying to learn a "no-op" or not update the representation for certain tokens, which requires pushing the softmax input to have a very large dynamic range. This results in outliers due to the combination of softmax, residuals, and layernorm.

2) By making architectural changes to allow the network to represent exact zeros or small updates in attention without outliers, such as clipped softmax or gated attention, we can achieve comparable accuracy while removing outliers.

3) This will enable easy and effective post-training quantization to low-bit integers without accuracy loss or need for retraining.

So in summary, the paper proposes architectural modifications to prevent outlier learning in order to improve transformer quantization, and validates this through experiments on BERT, OPT, and ViT models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing two modifications to the attention mechanism in Transformers - clipped softmax and gated attention - that can help reduce the outlier activations learned during training. 

The key ideas are:

- The paper analyzes why Transformers tend to learn strong outlier activations, relating it to attention heads trying to perform a "no-op" or not update the representation. To get the exact zeros needed for no-update via the softmax, the input gets pushed to a very large range, causing outliers.

- Based on this analysis, the authors propose clipped softmax to allow representing exact zeros without outliers by clipping the softmax input range. They also propose gated attention which adds a gating module to optionally pass through the attention output, avoiding reliance on outliers.

- Experiments on BERT, OPT (GPT-style) and ViT models show these modifications can significantly reduce outlier magnitudes while maintaining or sometimes improving accuracy. This enables easy quantization to 8-bit integers without outliers issues.

So in summary, the key contribution is identifying the root cause of outliers in Transformers and proposing two simple but effective architectural changes to remove this issue, enabling more efficient inference. The modifications seem generic and could likely benefit many Transformer variants.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the summary is: The paper proposes two modifications to the self-attention mechanism in transformer models - clipped softmax and gated attention - to prevent the models from learning large outliers during pre-training, making the models easier to quantize for efficient deployment.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The key contribution of this paper seems to be the two proposed modifications to the standard transformer architecture - clipped softmax and gated attention. These tweaks appear novel compared to prior work on quantizing transformers, which has mostly focused on changes to the training process or quantization methodology. 

- The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the root causes of outliers in transformer models, attributing them to "no-op" behavior by certain attention heads. This level of investigation into the source of outliers is more thorough than some prior work that observed their existence but did not delve into the underlying reasons (e.g. Dettmers et al., Bondarenko et al.).

- The paper builds directly on previous findings that modern transformers are difficult to quantize due to activation outliers after certain layers (Bondarenko et al., Dettmers et al.). However, it takes a new approach by addressing the architectural causes rather than adapting the quantization process.

- Compared to work like Q-BERT and Q8BERT that required retraining with Quantization-Aware Training, this method enables good quantization using only Post-Training Quantization which is more convenient.

- The techniques are evaluated on common transformer models like BERT and ViT, demonstrating broad applicability. The consistent gains across multiple architecture types is more comprehensive than some prior studies focused solely on BERT.

- The paper mostly focuses on quantization for computational efficiency rather than compression, in contrast to work like Compressive Transformers. The techniques may complement size-oriented methods.

- There is limited investigation of the impact on large-scale transformers. Some other papers have studied quantization specifically for huge models like GPT-3.

In summary, the paper delivers solid incremental progress over key prior work by proposing novel architectural changes to address the outlier problem and evaluating them thoroughly on major Transformer models. The analysis of the root causes also provides useful new insights.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing the proposed methods on large-scale transformer models. The paper evaluates the clipped softmax and gated attention techniques on smaller models like BERT and ViT, but the authors mention that it remains to be seen if the benefits generalize to much larger models. Testing the techniques on models like GPT-3 would be an important next step.

- Exploring the broader applicability of the "no-op" behavior identified in transformers. The authors suggest this may be a general technique used in other neural network architectures like CNNs as well. More investigation could shed light on how widespread this technique is.

- Further analyzing why the clipped softmax performed poorly on OPT models. The authors did not have a clear explanation for why this technique failed on the OPT architecture, so more analysis is needed.

- Evaluating the techniques on a wider range of transformer architectures and tasks. The paper covers a few representative models, but testing on more architectures like BART, T5, etc. would help validate the generality.

- Investigating if the small floating-point accuracy gains from the methods are consistent more broadly. The paper found small FP32 accuracy improvements on some models, but notes these may not hold generally. More extensive testing is needed.

- Reducing the hyperparameter dependence of the methods. Both clipped softmax and gated attention still require some tuning, so developing ways to make them more robust/parameter-free could improve applicability.

- Applying the techniques to initialize quantization-aware training. The authors suggest their methods could help provide better initialization for QAT as well. This could be explored.

So in summary, broader validation on more models, quantization techniques, and applications seems like the key next steps suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two modifications to the self-attention mechanism in transformer models - clipped softmax and gated attention - to address the issue of outliers in activations that make transformers difficult to quantize. The key insight is that outliers arise due to attention heads trying to learn a "no-op" by assigning high attention probabilities to tokens with small values, which pushes the softmax input to a high dynamic range. Clipped softmax allows representing exact zeros in attention to avoid this, while gated attention provides an explicit mechanism to nullify updates. Both modifications significantly reduce outlier magnitude and enable easy 8-bit quantization without accuracy loss, as demonstrated empirically on BERT, OPT and ViT models. Overall, the paper provides useful architectural improvements to make transformers naturally quantization-friendly.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes two modifications to the attention mechanism in Transformers to reduce outliers and enable easy quantization of the models. Transformers tend to learn strong outliers due to attention heads trying to learn a "no-op" update where attention probabilities focus on non-informative tokens. To achieve near-zero attention values, the input to softmax is pushed to a large range, causing outliers. The two proposed methods are clipped softmax, which allows representing zeros and ones exactly, and gated attention, which equips attention with explicit gating to nullify updates. 

Experiments on BERT, OPT and ViT models show both clipped softmax and gated attention significantly reduce outliers while maintaining or slightly improving floating point accuracy. This enables full INT8 quantization of activations without degradation. The methods are shown to be robust across hyperparameters. The paper provides an understanding of outlier causes and proposes architectural changes to remove the root problem. Overall, the work enables easy quantization of Transformers for efficient deployment without compromising accuracy.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a transformer-based neural machine translation system. The key method used is attention-based sequence-to-sequence learning. 

Specifically, the model is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder uses stacked self-attention and feedforward layers to transform the input text into an intermediate representation. The decoder generates the output text autoregressively one token at a time. At each step, it attends over the encoder outputs to focus on relevant parts of the source sentence. The attention mechanism allows the model to learn soft alignments between the input and output sequences. The decoder also uses self-attention over previously generated tokens and feedforward layers. 

The entire model is trained end-to-end to maximize the likelihood of generating the target translation given the source sentence. The attention mechanism allows the model to learn complex dependencies without relying on explicit alignments. The transformer architecture eschews recurrence and convolution in favor of stacked self-attention, which allows for more parallelization. This model achieves state-of-the-art performance on English-German and English-French translation benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problems/questions it is addressing are:

- Modern transformer models tend to learn strong outliers in their activations, which makes them difficult to quantize for efficient inference. Previous works have identified this issue, but don't address the root cause. 

- What is the underlying reason why these outliers appear in transformers during training?

- Can we modify the transformer architecture itself to prevent these outliers from appearing in the first place?

Specifically, the authors set out to:

- Analyze why activation outliers appear in transformers like BERT and vision transformers during pre-training. 

- Propose modifications to the self-attention mechanism to reduce these outliers by granting the model the flexibility to produce very small (or zero) attention outputs without requiring large outliers.

- Evaluate whether these architectural changes can enable easy quantization of transformers to low-bit integer representations without accuracy loss or the need for special quantization schemes.

So in summary, this paper aims to understand the root cause of outliers in modern transformers, and leverage that knowledge to propose architectural changes that make transformers naturally quantization-friendly right out of pre-training, without extra effort.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose two independent modifications to the standard transformer architecture - clipped softmax and gated attention. How are these two methods related in terms of the underlying motivation? What are the key differences between them?

2. The clipped softmax is introduced to allow the model to represent exact zeros in attention scores without producing outliers. How does the clipping range determined by the hyperparameters γ and ζ allow this? Why is clipping only at zero (γ<0) critical while clipping at one (ζ>1) does not seem to matter?

3. The paper argues that the outliers originate from attention heads trying to learn a "no-op" where the input is passed unchanged. Why does standard softmax attention make it difficult to learn no-ops? How do the proposed methods alleviate this issue? 

4. The gated attention mechanism adds extra parameters and computation compared to clipped softmax. What are the potential benefits of having an explicit gating function versus just modifying the softmax? When might gated attention be preferable over clipped softmax?

5. How sensitive are the proposed methods to the choice of hyperparameters like γ and ζ for clipped softmax and the bias initialization b_init for gated attention? What range of values seem to work well across different models like BERT, ViT, and OPT?

6. The paper evaluates the methods on BERT, OPT, and ViT models. Are there any notable differences in how well the methods work for these different transformer architectures? Why might one method perform better for a certain model?

7. Aside from reducing outliers, the paper reports improved floating point accuracy on some tasks with the proposed methods. Do you think these gains in accuracy are significant and likely to generalize? Why might limiting outliers also improve generalization?

8. How do the two methods specifically address the challenges of quantizing transformers compared to prior techniques? What aspects of quantization become easier with the proposed training procedures?

9. The outliers originate from a specific set of attention heads trying to learn no-ops. Why does this behavior emerge during pre-training - what aspects of pre-training encourage it? Could this issue be addressed by modifying the pre-training objective?

10. The analysis relies heavily on inspecting attention matrices to understand model behavior. What are some of the challenges and limitations of interpreting attention weights? Are there any alternative ways the authors could have diagnosed the outlier issue?
