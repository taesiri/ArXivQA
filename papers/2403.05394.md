# [A Deep Learning Method for Classification of Biophilic Artworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper explores the application of deep learning methods to classify artworks based on "Biophilic" characteristics. Biophilia refers to an innate human affinity towards nature and natural processes. Previous research has shown that exposure to nature and Biophilic designs has a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. However, there are no known techniques for classifying artworks based on Biophilic features. The authors aim to develop an AI system that can analyze paintings and label Biophilic traits to facilitate the curation of a Biophilic art gallery.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an encoder-decoder neural network model for multi-label Biophilic image classification. The encoder uses CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), specifically a Vision Transformer (ViT), to generate a 512-dimensional embedding vector representing the semantic content of an artwork. The decoder consists of fully connected layers to map the embedding to 15 Biophilic classification labels such as plants, water bodies, animals etc. A dataset of 15,097 artwork images is created with manual Biophilic annotations. Data augmentation techniques are used to increase balance and diversity. The model is trained to predict all Biophilic labels present in artwork and determine the most dominant one.  

Key Contributions:
- Creation of an annotated dataset of 15,097 artworks with 15 Biophilic classification labels
- Development of a deep neural network using CLIP and Vision Transformer to accurately predict multiple Biophilic traits
- Classification model outperforms ResNet50 and DEIT models with over 90% weighted F1 score
- Model explanations provided through LIME to highlight relevant regions
- Curation of a Biophilic art gallery in collaboration with Vieunite using model predictions
- Framework to facilitate future research on Biophilic art and design for health/wellbeing

In summary, the paper presents a novel deep learning approach for Biophilic classification of artwork to enable curation of nature-inspired art galleries aimed at improving mental health.
