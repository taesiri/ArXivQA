# [Model Breadcrumbs: Scaling Multi-Task Model Merging with Sparse Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Foundation models like CLIP and T5 have become very popular and effective on a range of tasks. A common approach is to fine-tune these foundation models on specific downstream tasks, resulting in many publicly available fine-tuned models. However, jointly training a single multi-task model on multiple datasets is often infeasible due to computational constraints, data privacy issues, or lack of access to the training data. Existing techniques for merging multiple fine-tuned models struggle to scale and generalize as more models are combined.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces Model Breadcrumbs, a simple yet effective framework to construct multi-task models from existing fine-tuned foundation models without needing the original training data. It works by subtracting the foundation model weights from each fine-tuned model to get a weight trajectory or "breadcrumb" capturing the important task-specific knowledge. These trajectories are sparsified to remove negligible and outlier weight changes. The sparse trajectories from multiple tasks are aggregated and applied on top of the foundation model weights to create the multi-task model.

Key Contributions:
- Model Breadcrumbs consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art like Task Vectors, especially as more tasks are combined, with superior scalability and hyperparameter generalization.
- Experiments across 8 image and 4 NLP datasets show Breadcrumbs enables creating multi-task models that match or exceed individual fine-tuned model performance.
- Model Breadcrumbs can also enhance existing fine-tuned models by merging related tasks, without needing additional data.
- The approach is simple, efficient, robust, and aligns with the paradigm of updatable machine learning through community-driven model refinement.

In summary, Model Breadcrumbs provides an effective way to construct versatile multi-task models from publicly available or privately trained fine-tuned foundation models, with promising scalability and performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Model Breadcrumbs, a simple and effective method to construct multi-task models from existing fine-tuned foundation models by merging sparse masks that trace out beneficial trajectories through the model's weight space, improving performance across tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Model Breadcrumbs, a simple and effective method for merging multiple fine-tuned models of the same foundation model to construct a multi-task model. The key aspects of Model Breadcrumbs include:

1) It creates a sparsely defined set of weights called "breadcrumbs" that carve out a trajectory within the weight space of a pre-trained model to transfer knowledge across tasks while filtering out harmful perturbations. 

2) Experiments show Model Breadcrumbs can simultaneously improve performance across multiple tasks, outperforming prior methods like Task Vectors.

3) The hyperparameters exhibit stability and generalizability as more tasks are added, reducing the need for extensive tuning.

4) Model Breadcrumbs is computationally efficient, simple to implement, and facilitates building multi-task models from publicly available fine-tuned models, aligning with the trend of updatable machine learning.

In summary, Model Breadcrumbs provides a scalable and effective approach to merge models and construct versatile multi-task models from existing fine-tuned foundations models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Foundation models - The paper focuses on using large pre-trained models like CLIP and T5 as the base for further fine-tuning. These models are referred to as "foundation models".

- Fine-tuning - The process of adapting a foundation model to perform better on a specific task by continuing the training on task-specific data. Many publicly available fine-tuned models are used in the paper's experiments.

- Multi-task learning - Constructing one model capable of performing well on multiple tasks. This is enabled by the merging of multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model.

- Model Breadcrumbs - The proposed method in the paper for producing multi-task models by merging fine-tuned foundation models. Involves creating sparse masks to extract trajectories.

- Task vectors - An existing technique for multi-task model merging that is evaluated in comparison to Model Breadcrumbs.

- Scaling - Evaluating model merging techniques as the number of tasks grows large. Model Breadcrumbs is shown to be more scalable.

- Hyperparameter stability - Model Breadcrumbs requires less hyperparameter tuning compared to prior methods as more tasks are added, making it more practical.

The key focus is on efficiently merging multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without needing the original training data, using the introduced Model Breadcrumbs technique.
