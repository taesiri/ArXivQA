# [Summarization-based Data Augmentation for Document Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00513)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel data augmentation method called SUMMaug for document classification tasks. The key idea is to leverage text summarization to generate concise, abstractive examples from the original training data. Specifically, an off-the-shelf summarization model summarizes the input text of each original training example. To handle fine-grained classification tasks, the labels of the augmented examples are merged into coarser groups as needed, conforming to the more generalized content. The augmented data is then utilized to perform curriculum learning - first pre-training the model on the easy-to-learn summarized examples before fine-tuning on the original data. This learning curriculum mirrors how humans develop text comprehension abilities. Experiments on two IMDb review datasets demonstrate that curriculum fine-tuning with SUMMaug data augmentation enhances both accuracy and training stability over baseline methods. Particularly, SUMMaug is robust and effective even in low-resource settings. The simplicity of this method means it can likely generalize to other document classification domains. Overall, this paper presents a novel application of summarization for generating trainable pseudo-data to improve comprehension of lengthy text.
