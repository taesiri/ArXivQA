# [LoL: A Comparative Regularization Loss over Query Reformulation Losses   for Pseudo-Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11545)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we enhance the ability of pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) models to suppress irrelevant information when reformulating queries, so as to alleviate query drift caused by using more feedback documents?

The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:

1) Currently PRF models are optimized independently for queries revised using different amounts of feedback, ignoring the principle that more feedback should lead to better revisions. 

2) Adding a comparative regularization loss that penalizes revisions using more feedback but obtaining larger reformulation losses can teach the model to suppress irrelevant information by comparing different revisions.

3) This proposed Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework is widely applicable for different PRF models and retrieval paradigms.

The experiments then aim to validate whether the proposed LoL method can improve PRF effectiveness and robustness by enhancing the model's ability to ignore irrelevant information when more feedback documents are used.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework with comparative regularization for pseudo-relevance feedback in information retrieval. Specifically:

- It points out a comparison principle that an ideal PRF model should guarantee: the more feedback documents, the better the reformulated query. This principle is often neglected by existing PRF methods. 

- It proposes a comparative regularization term to constrain the reformulation losses of multiple revisions derived from the same original query. This regularization pursues the above comparison principle by penalizing revisions that use more feedback but obtain larger losses.

- It presents a simple implementation of the framework with a differentiable query reformulation method. This method operates in the vector space to directly optimize ranking performance, applicable for both sparse and dense retrieval models.

- Experimental results on MS MARCO benchmarks show the effectiveness of LoL models over base retrieval models and other PRF baselines. The comparative regularization is proven to play a critical role through ablation studies and analysis.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the Loss-over-Loss framework with comparative regularization to enhance PRF models' ability to suppress irrelevant information by comparing parallel revisions of the same query. This helps alleviate the query drift problem in pseudo-relevance feedback.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of this paper:

The paper proposes a Loss-over-Loss framework with comparative regularization for pseudo-relevance feedback models to learn to suppress irrelevant information in more feedback documents and generate better reformulated queries.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of pseudo-relevance feedback for information retrieval:

- This paper proposes a new framework called Loss-over-Loss (LoL) for training pseudo-relevance feedback models. The key novelty is the use of a comparative regularization loss to ensure the model learns to produce better query reformulations when given more feedback documents. This addresses the issue of query drift in a novel way compared to prior methods.

- Most prior work has focused on adding preprocessing or postprocessing steps to deal with query drift, selecting better feedback documents, or fusing results from the original and expanded queries. In contrast, LoL provides a new way to directly supervise the model during training to handle increasing amounts of feedback.

- LoL is model-agnostic and can work with both sparse and dense retrievers, unlike some prior PRF methods tailored for one type of retrieval. The authors demonstrate LoL improves both a lexical sparse retriever and dense neural retriever.

- The only other end-to-end trainable PRF model for dense retrieval is ANCE-PRF. But it trains separate models per feedback depth and does not have LoL's comparative regularization. LoL outperforms ANCE-PRF in the authors' experiments.

- For sparse retrieval, LoL is compared to classic heuristics like RM3 and Rocchio as well as a strong lexical matching model. The gains from LoL demonstrate PRF can further improve state-of-the-art sparse retrievers.

In summary, LoL provides a novel training framework for PRF models that helps address query drift in a principled way. It advances the state-of-the-art for both sparse and dense retrieval compared to prior PRF techniques. The comparative regularization approach seems promising for future exploration.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Exploring the application of other learning-to-rank losses for the comparative regularization term in the Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework. The authors mention that the current comparative regularization aims to guarantee an unsupervised normal order of objects, and can be seen as an application of learning-to-rank. Therefore, they suggest exploring other learning-to-rank losses in place of the pairwise hinge loss currently used.

2. Replacing the reformulation loss function used to map queries to differentiable values. The reformulation loss currently uses a ranking loss, but the authors suggest exploring other differentiable loss functions that could replace this mapping.

3. Applying comparative regularization techniques to other tasks that have neglected normal orders that should be maintained. The authors suggest the comparative regularization idea could be applicable beyond just query reformulation for pseudo-relevance feedback.

4. Exploring differentiable query reformulation methods for other retrieval frameworks beyond sparse and dense retrieval explored in this paper. The current method focuses on single-representation retrieval models.

In summary, the main directions are exploring other loss functions for the comparative regularization, replacing the reformulation loss function, applying comparative regularization to other tasks, and exploring differentiable query reformulation for other retrieval models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework for pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in information retrieval to address the problem of query drift. The key idea is to impose a comparative regularization on the training losses of multiple parallel revisions of the same query that use different amounts of feedback documents. Specifically, the regularization term penalizes revisions that use more feedback documents but result in larger losses, which encourages the model to suppress irrelevant information when more feedback is available. The paper presents a differentiable PRF method to implement this framework, where queries are revised directly in the vector space to enable end-to-end training. Experiments on the MS MARCO dataset show that models trained with the LoL framework outperform baseline PRF methods and are more robust to increasing amounts of feedback documents. The comparative regularization is shown to play a key role through ablation studies and analysis of the training dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Loss-over-Loss (LoL) to improve pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) for information retrieval. PRF assumes that the top ranked documents from an initial query contain relevant information, and uses these documents to reformulate an improved query. However, PRF models often fail to suppress irrelevant information that appears when using more feedback documents, leading to query drift. 

The key idea of LoL is to impose a comparative regularization loss on the reformulation losses of multiple revisions of the same query. Specifically, the query is revised multiple times in parallel using different amounts of feedback documents. The reformulation losses of these revisions are then regularized to ensure revisions using more feedback have smaller losses. This forces the model to suppress irrelevant information by comparing revisions. Experiments on the MS MARCO dataset demonstrate LoL improves both sparse and dense retrieval over baselines. The results show LoL makes PRF more robust to using more feedback documents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework for pseudo-relevance feedback to address the issue of query drift caused by irrelevant information in the feedback documents. The key idea is to impose a comparative regularization on the reformulation losses of multiple revisions of the same query that use different amounts of feedback documents. Specifically, the original query is revised in parallel multiple times using different sizes of feedback sets in each training batch. A pairwise ranking loss is then introduced to regularize the reformulation losses of these parallel revisions, so that the loss is expected to be non-increasing with respect to the amount of feedback. This comparative regularization penalizes revisions using more feedback but obtaining larger losses, and encourages the model to suppress irrelevant information by comparing different revisions. The authors implement this framework with a differentiable method that directly revises query vectors instead of query text, making it applicable for both sparse and dense retrieval.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is the query drift issue in pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) for information retrieval. 

Specifically, the paper points out that existing PRF methods tend to suffer from query drift, where the revised query drifts away from the original intent, due to the irrelevant information introduced from the feedback documents. This leads to degraded retrieval performance. 

To address this issue, the paper proposes a new framework called Loss-over-Loss (LoL) that regularizes the reformulation losses of multiple revisions of the same query to enforce a comparison principle - the more feedback documents, the better the revision. The key idea is to use comparative regularization to train the PRF model to suppress irrelevant information when more feedback documents are used.

In summary, the paper aims to improve the robustness of PRF methods to query drift caused by irrelevant feedback information, through a novel Loss-over-Loss framework with comparative regularization.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Loss-over-Loss (LoL) for optimizing pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) models. PRF is a query expansion technique that aims to reformulate an original query using top retrieved pseudo-relevant documents. However, existing PRF methods suffer from query drift, where the reformulated query drifts away from the original intent due to noise. 

The key idea of LoL is a comparative regularization over multiple reformulation losses derived from the same query. Specifically, the same original query is revised in parallel using different amounts of pseudo-relevant feedback. Then a regularization term is introduced to penalize a revision that uses more feedback but results in a larger reformulation loss. This comparative regularization allows the model to suppress irrelevant information by comparing parallel revisions.

The paper further presents a specific implementation of LoL that directly optimizes retrieval metrics by revising queries in the vector space. This avoids natural language generation and makes it applicable to both sparse and dense retrieval models.

Experiments on MS MARCO demonstrate LoL's effectiveness over base retrieval models and existing PRF baselines. Ablation studies verify the contribution of comparative regularization. Moreover, analysis shows that LoL makes PRF more robust to the number of feedback documents. The visualization of loss curves provides insights into model training.

Overall, the paper proposes an effective and general framework LoL to enhance PRF models' ability to suppress irrelevant information in feedback. The introduced comparative regularization over losses is a novel technique worthy of further exploration.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Loss-over-Loss (LoL) for training pseudo-relevance feedback models to improve information retrieval performance. Pseudo-relevance feedback uses top retrieved documents to reformulate the original query. However, more feedback documents can introduce irrelevant information that causes query drift. The key idea of LoL is to train the model to compare multiple reformulations of the same query using different amounts of feedback documents. A comparative regularization loss is introduced that penalizes a reformulation using more feedback if its reformulation loss is higher than one using less feedback. This teaches the model to suppress irrelevant information when more feedback is provided. Experiments on sparse and dense retrieval models show LoL improves over baseline methods across multiple datasets. The framework is model-agnostic and introduces no additional cost at inference time. Overall, LoL enhances pseudo-relevance feedback models' ability to leverage more feedback documents while preventing query drift.
