# [BlazeBVD: Make Scale-Time Equalization Great Again for Blind Video   Deflickering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06243)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Video flickering degrades temporal consistency and is caused by issues with camera hardware, lighting conditions, or image processing algorithms. Existing blind video deflickering (BVD) methods using deep learning face challenges in terms of high computational demands and inability to fully restore color and texture affected by illumination changes or over/underexposure. They have not effectively leveraged more compact representations beyond raw pixel values to simplify the spatio-temporal complexity inherent to video data.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes BlazeBVD, a histogram-assisted BVD approach to achieve fast and faithful texture restoration given illumination fluctuation and over/underexposure. It has 3 main stages:

1) Extract deflickering priors using scale-time equalization (STE) on illumination histograms, including filtered illumination maps to guide global flicker removal, a set of singular frames indicating flicker, and exposure maps delineating over/underexposure.  

2) Remove global flicker using filtered illumination maps to guide a 2D network per frame. Address local flicker and exposure issues by transferring details from neighboring frames guided by the singular frame set and exposure maps.

3) Refine temporal consistency using a lightweight 3D network with an adaptive warping loss to avoid blurring.

Main Contributions:

- First BVD method to leverage histogram representation to simplify spatio-temporal complexity and enable faster processing
- Utilizes deflickering priors from STE to guide global and local flicker removal modules 
- Faithfully restores color and texture affected by illumination/exposure fluctuations
- Achieves over 10x faster inference than state-of-the-art BVD techniques
- Effectively handles both illumination changes and over/underexposure challenges

The proposed BlazeBVD pipeline achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance on synthetic, real-world, and generated video datasets. Ablation studies validate the utility of key modules and design choices.
