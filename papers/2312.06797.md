# [Improving the Robustness of 3D Human Pose Estimation: A Benchmark and   Learning from Noisy Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper studies the robustness of 2D-to-3D human pose estimation methods that first detect 2D keypoints from images/videos and then lift them to 3D. Prior works have achieved good performance on clean datasets, but degrade significantly on real-world noisy inputs. The paper argues that existing datasets lack challenging corruption and do not expose this robustness issue.  

Contributions:
1. Proposes two new benchmark datasets called Human3.6M-C and HumanEva-I-C by corrupting existing datasets with noise, occlusion, blur etc. Shows state-of-the-art methods perform poorly on these, motivating new solutions.

2. Introduces a simple yet effective data augmentation method called Temporal Additive Gaussian Noise (TAGN) that adds noise to the 2D pose during training. This makes models robust to errors in 2D pose estimation at test time.

3. Designs a novel Confidence-Aware Convolution (CA-Conv) block that incorporates the confidence scores of the 2D detector into the 3D lifting network. This improves performance when 2D keypoints are noisy or occluded.

4. Comprehensively analyzes several state-of-the-art lifting methods like VP3D, PoseFormer etc on the new benchmarks. Shows TAGN and CA-Conv consistently improve performance across methods, establishing them as simple but strong baselines.

To summarize, this paper makes the important observation that existing 3D pose estimators are not robust to corrupted inputs. It addresses this by proposing datasets, data augmentation techniques and network blocks to explicitly account for noise and occlusion. Simple techniques like TAGN and CA-Conv are shown to significantly boost performance across diverse base models.
