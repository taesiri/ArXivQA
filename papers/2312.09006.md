## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FedSSA, a novel federated learning framework that enables efficient and accurate model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning. FedSSA splits each client's model into a heterogeneous feature extractor and a homogeneous classification header. It performs local-to-global knowledge transfer via a semantic similarity-based header parameter aggregation strategy, where clients only need to upload header parameters of locally seen classes for aggregation by class at the server. Global-to-local knowledge transfer is achieved via an adaptive parameter stabilization strategy, where historical local header parameters are fused with the latest global header parameters by class before local model training to speed up convergence. Theoretical analysis proves FedSSA's convergence. Extensive experiments on CIFAR datasets demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, FedSSA achieves significantly higher accuracy and efficiency in terms of communication and computation costs. It also exhibits strong robustness against data heterogeneity and varying client participation rates. The proposed techniques for efficient and accurate model personalization make FedSSA well-suited for practical personalized federated learning applications.
