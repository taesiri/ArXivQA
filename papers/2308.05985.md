# [TrajPAC: Towards Robustness Verification of Pedestrian Trajectory   Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05985)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It provides formal definitions for two kinds of robustness in trajectory prediction models: label robustness and pure robustness. Label robustness measures the prediction accuracy after attacks, while pure robustness quantifies the prediction stability. 

- It proposes a PAC (probably approximately correct) framework called TrajPAC for verifying the robustness of trajectory forecasting models. The key idea is to learn a local PAC model approximating the prediction error, and then analyze the robustness properties based on this PAC model. 

- It applies TrajPAC to evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate TrajPAC's scalability, efficiency, and capability of generating interpretable adversarial examples.

- Through experiments, the paper studies factors that contribute to the robustness of different prediction models. It identifies critical paths and steps that are most sensitive to perturbations based on the PAC model's coefficients.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed TrajPAC framework can efficiently and effectively verify, analyze and interpret the robustness of trajectory forecasting models. The experiments on benchmark datasets and models validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- The paper provides formal definitions for two kinds of robustness in trajectory prediction models: label robustness and pure robustness. These allow the authors to specify the prediction accuracy and stability of models after adversarial attacks. 

- The paper proposes TrajPAC, a framework for verifying the robustness of trajectory forecasting models. TrajPAC learns a local probably approximately correct (PAC) model of the trajectory prediction model by sampling, and uses this to analyze robustness and provide interpretation.

- The paper evaluates TrajPAC on four state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models (Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, and MID) using datasets like ETH/UCY. The results demonstrate TrajPAC's scalability, efficiency, and ability to find adversaries comparable to PGD attacks.

- Through sensitivity analysis of the PAC model, the paper identifies key factors influencing robustness of different models. This provides intuitive interpretation of model behaviors.

In summary, the main contribution is a PAC framework called TrajPAC that can efficiently verify, analyze, and interpret the robustness of various trajectory prediction models. The formal robustness definitions and experimental analysis of state-of-the-art models using TrajPAC are also key contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes TrajPAC, a framework based on probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for verifying and analyzing the robustness of pedestrian trajectory prediction models, provides formal definitions of label and pure robustness, and demonstrates TrajPAC's effectiveness in evaluating robustness and interpretability on several state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting models using the ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in pedestrian trajectory prediction:

- It focuses specifically on the robustness and security issues of trajectory prediction models, whereas most prior work has focused only on improving accuracy. 

- It provides formal definitions and analysis of robustness for trajectory prediction, including proposing two new robustness metrics: label robustness and pure robustness. This adds rigor compared to prior works that discuss robustness only qualitatively.

- It adapts the PAC framework from computer vision to trajectory prediction to enable efficient verification of robustness properties. This is a novel application of PAC learning.

- It proposes a method called TrajPAC for verifying robustness of trajectory predictors using a local PAC model. This is a new approach tailored to stochastic trajectory forecasters. 

- It evaluates TrajPAC on modern neural trajectory forecasters like Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, and MID. Most prior verification works focus on simpler models.

- It provides interpretation analysis of model robustness by identifying critical steps and paths. This explainability perspective is unique among trajectory prediction papers.

Overall, this paper makes valuable theoretical and technical contributions towards understanding and verifying the robustness of modern learning-based pedestrian trajectory predictors. The formal modeling, adapted PAC framework, and TrajPAC tool offer innovations not explored by prior work in this field. The robustness evaluations on neural methods also help benchmark their reliability.
