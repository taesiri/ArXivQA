# [TrajPAC: Towards Robustness Verification of Pedestrian Trajectory   Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05985)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It provides formal definitions for two kinds of robustness in trajectory prediction models: label robustness and pure robustness. Label robustness measures the prediction accuracy after attacks, while pure robustness quantifies the prediction stability. 

- It proposes a PAC (probably approximately correct) framework called TrajPAC for verifying the robustness of trajectory forecasting models. The key idea is to learn a local PAC model approximating the prediction error, and then analyze the robustness properties based on this PAC model. 

- It applies TrajPAC to evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate TrajPAC's scalability, efficiency, and capability of generating interpretable adversarial examples.

- Through experiments, the paper studies factors that contribute to the robustness of different prediction models. It identifies critical paths and steps that are most sensitive to perturbations based on the PAC model's coefficients.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed TrajPAC framework can efficiently and effectively verify, analyze and interpret the robustness of trajectory forecasting models. The experiments on benchmark datasets and models validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Consider more realistic safety properties in trajectory prediction beyond robustness. The authors suggest exploring properties related to collisions, comfort, etc. that are important for real-world autonomous driving systems.

- Use the verification results to analyze safety of autonomous driving scenarios. The robustness verification techniques could be integrated into simulations to assess end-to-end system safety.

- Explore different perturbation sets beyond Lp norms. The authors use L-infinity norm perturbations but suggest trying more realistic perturbation models. 

- Develop verification methods that scale to large, real-world datasets. The techniques are currently demonstrated on small academic datasets.

- Consider ensemble methods and other ways to handle stochastic predictions. The paper handles stochasticity by sampling, but other techniques like verifying on the ensemble could be explored.

- Extend the interpretability analysis, for example by looking at perturbations to multiple agents or over longer input sequences. The paper performs only limited interpretation experiments.

- Develop theoretical connections between the PAC verification approach and adversarial robustness. The link could be formalized more clearly.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a PAC (probably approximately correct) framework for verifying the robustness of trajectory prediction models called TrajPAC. The authors first provide formal definitions for two types of robustness - label robustness and pure robustness - which specify the prediction accuracy and stability after adversarial attacks, respectively. They argue previous robustness definitions are ambiguous. TrajPAC is inspired by DeepPAC, where they sample the input space, learn a PAC model that approximates the original model, and deduce robustness properties. However, adapting DeepPAC is non-trivial due to the inherent stochasticity of trajectory predictors. The PAC model learned is a locally linear approximation, which also provides interpretability. Using TrajPAC, the authors evaluate robustness and provide an analysis on four state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting models - Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, and MID - using the ETH/UCY dataset. They find TrajPAC is highly scalable, efficient, and capable of generating adversaries comparable to PGD. Through sensitivity analysis, TrajPAC also identifies factors influencing robustness performance.

In summary, this paper proposes TrajPAC, a PAC framework for verifying and interpreting robustness of trajectory predictors. TrajPAC provides formal robustness definitions tailored to trajectory forecasting and adapts DeepPAC to handle stochastic models. Experiments demonstrate TrajPAC's scalability, efficiency, and utility for analysis across diverse state-of-the-art methods. The sensitivity analysis also provides insight into model vulnerabilities. Overall, TrajPAC enables more rigorous robustness verification for trajectory forecasters.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a PAC (probably approximately correct) framework called TrajPAC for verifying the robustness of trajectory prediction models. TrajPAC first provides formal definitions for label robustness and pure robustness in the context of trajectory forecasting. To verify these robustness properties, TrajPAC learns a local PAC model of the prediction model's behavior by sampling input-output pairs in a region around a sample input trajectory. Specifically, it learns an affine function that upper bounds the post-attack error (label ADE or pure ADE) from the prediction model. With enough samples, this PAC model provably upper bounds the error with high probability. TrajPAC can then analyze the robustness by checking if the PAC model's upper bound is below a safety threshold. Moreover, the learned affine PAC model enables generation of adversarial examples and interpretation of model robustness by identifying sensitive input features. Experiments show TrajPAC can efficiently verify robustness for various state-of-the-art trajectory predictors.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper appears to be addressing the problem of evaluating and verifying the robustness of pedestrian trajectory prediction models. Specifically, it seems to focus on the following key issues:

1. The lack of formal definitions for robustness in trajectory prediction models. Previous works have discussed robustness conceptually but do not provide mathematical definitions to precisely specify things like the acceptable perturbation radius. 

2. Ambiguity around whether robustness should be measured against the ground truth trajectory or the original model prediction. The paper introduces two definitions - "label robustness" which measures accuracy against the ground truth after perturbation, and "pure robustness" which measures stability of predictions before and after perturbation.

3. Lack of rigorous verification methods that check robustness over the entire disturbance region, rather than just at sampled points. The paper adapts the PAC framework to provide probabilistic verification with confidence/error guarantees. 

4. Limited understanding of what factors influence robustness in trajectory predictors. The paper aims to provide interpretable analysis by identifying critical steps/paths in trajectories using the PAC model.

Overall, the paper seems to address important theoretical and practical gaps in evaluating, verifying and interpreting the robustness of trajectory forecasting models. The formal modeling and proposed TrajPAC framework appear novel and could advance work on ensuring reliable/trustworthy predictions.
