# [TRAP: Targeted Random Adversarial Prompt Honeypot for Black-Box   Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12991)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper introduces a new task called "black-box identity verification" (BBIV). BBIV aims to determine whether a third-party application is using a specific proprietary large language model (LLM) through its chat interface, when only black-box access to the application is available. This is an important capability for LLM providers to assess compliance and detect potential misuse of their models. However, existing methods like directly prompting the model, fingerprinting based on closed questions, and perplexity-based identification have limitations in reliably identifying LLMs.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a method called "targeted random adversarial prompts" (TRAP) to address the BBIV task. The key idea is to craft a prompt suffix that induces the reference LLM to give a specific predetermined answer, while other models give random responses. This exploits recent techniques for "jailbreaking" LLMs using adversarial prompt engineering. Specifically, TRAP optimizes a suffix using an algorithm called greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) to maximize the likelihood of the target answer from the reference LLM. 

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a novel task called BBIV that is critical for enforcing compliance and preventing misuse of LLMs
- Proposes a reliable technique called TRAP that can accurately identify target LLMs behind third-party applications using suffixes that elicit specific responses
- Demonstrates that TRAP can identify reference LLMs with over 95% true positive rate at under 0.2% false positive rate using a single chat interaction
- Shows that TRAP is robust even if the target LLM has minor modifications that do not significantly change its behavior

In summary, the paper makes important contributions around the BBIV problem and introduces an effective TRAP solution that has promising security applications for LLM providers.
