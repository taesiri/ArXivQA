# [Auto311: A Confidence-guided Automated System for Non-emergency Call](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Emergency response systems are critical for public safety but overwhelmed with a growing volume of calls. Non-emergency 311 calls further strain limited resources. Manual handling of these calls is tedious and inefficient. There is a need for an automated system to handle non-emergency calls to improve emergency response.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Auto311, the first automated system to handle 311 non-emergency calls. Key capabilities:

1) Incident Type Prediction: Dynamically predict ongoing incident types (e.g. lost property, noise complaint) to guide case report generation. Uses a hierarchical structure and confidence scoring to handle multiple shifting incident types.

2) Information Itemization: Gather essential details from caller utterances to complete sections of the generated case reports. Uses extractive question answering and classification to itemize narratives and confirm facts.

3) Confidence-Guided Dialogue: Leverage confidence scores to ensure high-certainty report completion and optimize follow-up questions. Adapts case reports and conversations as incident details evolve.

The system comprises modules for conversational interface, handover control, incident prediction, information itemization and confidence-guided optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Collect and analyze 11,796 real 311 call recordings with multiple incident types
- Design first automated 311 call handling system Auto311 with novel confidence scoring
- Achieve 92.54% average F1 in incident prediction using confidence to enhance BERT
- Demonstrate automated information itemization outperforming LLMs like GPT-3.5
- Show system-level optimization of dialogues and adaptation to shifting incidents  

The experiments indicate Auto311 can effectively predict incident types, gather critical details, and streamline non-emergency call handling through confidence-guided optimization. This can alleviate burden on emergency response systems.
