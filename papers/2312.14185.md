# [Auto311: A Confidence-guided Automated System for Non-emergency Call](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Emergency response systems are critical for public safety but overwhelmed with a growing volume of calls. Non-emergency 311 calls further strain limited resources. Manual handling of these calls is tedious and inefficient. There is a need for an automated system to handle non-emergency calls to improve emergency response.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Auto311, the first automated system to handle 311 non-emergency calls. Key capabilities:

1) Incident Type Prediction: Dynamically predict ongoing incident types (e.g. lost property, noise complaint) to guide case report generation. Uses a hierarchical structure and confidence scoring to handle multiple shifting incident types.

2) Information Itemization: Gather essential details from caller utterances to complete sections of the generated case reports. Uses extractive question answering and classification to itemize narratives and confirm facts.

3) Confidence-Guided Dialogue: Leverage confidence scores to ensure high-certainty report completion and optimize follow-up questions. Adapts case reports and conversations as incident details evolve.

The system comprises modules for conversational interface, handover control, incident prediction, information itemization and confidence-guided optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Collect and analyze 11,796 real 311 call recordings with multiple incident types
- Design first automated 311 call handling system Auto311 with novel confidence scoring
- Achieve 92.54% average F1 in incident prediction using confidence to enhance BERT
- Demonstrate automated information itemization outperforming LLMs like GPT-3.5
- Show system-level optimization of dialogues and adaptation to shifting incidents  

The experiments indicate Auto311 can effectively predict incident types, gather critical details, and streamline non-emergency call handling through confidence-guided optimization. This can alleviate burden on emergency response systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Auto311, the first automated system tailored to handle non-emergency 311 calls by effectively predicting incident types, generating case reports, and optimizing dialogues using confidence guidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors collect, transcribe, annotate, and analyze 11,796 authentic audio recordings from non-emergency calls, with permission from Metro Nashville Government. 

2. They build the first automated system Auto311 to handle non-emergency 311 calls. Auto311 can effectively and dynamically predict ongoing non-emergency incident types, generate tailored case reports during the call, and itemize essential information from dialogue contexts to complete the reports. 

3. They create a novel approach to measure the confidence score that is used to guide the behavior of the Auto311 system.

4. They thoroughly evaluate the performance of Auto311's modules. Auto311 achieves an average F-1 score of 92.54% on the incident type prediction task and an average score of 0.9329 when dealing with real-world recordings in information itemization.

5. They emulate the usage of Auto311 using recordings from their dataset and analyze Auto311's system-level impacts. The results show Auto311 can effectively decrease conversation turns, categorize the ongoing call with 94.49% mean accuracy, and dynamically adjust to shifting incident types.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and evaluation of Auto311, the first automated system to handle non-emergency 311 calls. Auto311 demonstrates strong capabilities in critical tasks like incident type prediction, information extraction, conversation optimization, and adaptability.
