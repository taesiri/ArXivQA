# [UDAPDR: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via LLM Prompting and   Distillation of Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00807)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we adapt neural information retrieval models to new domains in an unsupervised manner by leveraging large language models to generate synthetic training data?More specifically, the authors propose an approach called UDAPDR that uses expensive large language models like GPT-3 to generate a small set of high-quality synthetic queries, and then uses those to create prompts for a less expensive model like Flan-T5 XXL to generate a large set of additional synthetic queries. These synthetic queries are used to train multiple passage rerankers which are then distilled into a single efficient retriever like ColBERTv2 for deployment. The key hypothesis seems to be that this strategy of using different large language models in a staged process to generate synthetic training data, along with distilling multiple rerankers into a single retriever, can enable unsupervised domain adaptation and improve retrieval accuracy in new domains, without needing any labeled data from the target domain.The experiments on several datasets aim to validate whether UDAPDR can boost accuracy in zero-shot settings compared to just using the base retriever, and also achieve competitive latency compared to standard reranking techniques.So in summary, the central research question is about unsupervised domain adaptation for neural IR via strategic use of large language models and distillation, with the hypothesis that the proposed UDAPDR technique can improve accuracy while maintaining efficient retrieval latency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a new method for unsupervised domain adaptation of neural information retrieval models called UDAPDR. Here are the key points:- Proposes UDAPDR, a new approach for adapting neural retrievers like ColBERTv2 to new domains without in-domain labeled data. - Uses large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Flan-T5 XXL to generate synthetic queries for the target domain passages. This allows fine-tuning passage rerankers on domain-specific data.- Distills the passage rerankers into a single ColBERTv2 retriever via multi-teacher distillation. This preserves accuracy gains while maintaining the low latency of ColBERTv2.- Shows UDAPDR boosts zero-shot ColBERTv2 accuracy substantially on diverse domains like LoTTE, BEIR, NQ, and SQuAD.- Achieves competitive results to training a reranker with synthetic data while having much lower query latency due to distillation into the retriever.- Requires only thousands of synthetic queries for training unlike prior work that uses millions. This makes the approach more feasible.- Provides an end-to-end unsupervised domain adaptation technique for neural IR, including prompts, data generation, reranker training, and distillation.In summary, the main contribution is an efficient method to adapt neural retrievers to new domains by generating synthetic queries with LLMs and distilling passage rerankers into the retriever. This boosts accuracy without needing labels.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes an efficient unsupervised domain adaptation technique for neural retrievers that uses expensive and inexpensive language models to generate synthetic queries for training multiple passage rerankers, which are then distilled into a single performant and fast retriever.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper proposes a new method called UDAPDR for unsupervised domain adaptation of neural retrievers using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Flan-T5. Other recent works have also explored using LLMs to generate synthetic training data for adapting retrievers to new domains, but this paper presents a unique approach using prompting and distillation.- A key difference is the use of multiple passage rerankers as teachers to distill into a single retriever like ColBERTv2. Many prior works trained or fine-tuned a single cross-encoder reranker. Using an ensemble of rerankers is more computationally efficient and preserves accuracy better according to the results.- The paper shows competitive results on several datasets like LoTTE, BEIR, NQ, and SQuAD compared to prior state-of-the-art methods for domain adaptation like PromptAugator. However, a limitation is that NQ and SQuAD were used in pretraining some of the models, which could boost performance.- Unlike some prior work requiring millions of synthetic training queries, this method shows significant gains using only thousands of queries generated by the LLMs. This makes it more practical and less computationally demanding.- Compared to methods that fine-tune the retriever itself on synthetic data, this distillation approach adapts the retriever with lower latency at inference time by avoiding the use of computationally expensive rerankers.- Overall, the paper demonstrates a novel way to efficiently leverage recent advances in LLMs for unsupervised domain adaptation that is competitive or superior to prior state-of-the-art while being more practical. The code and data are also being made publicly available.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Testing the efficacy of their domain adaptation technique with other retrieval models besides ColBERTv2, such as dense retrievers based on models like DeBERTaV3, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. - Exploring different distillation strategies for shrinking the passage reranker itself, rather than just distilling it into the retriever.- Developing a more systematic approach for generating the initial prompts used with GPT-3 and Flan-T5 XXL for synthetic query generation. The authors mention that they drew upon recent work to create their prompts, but suggest creating a more robust prompting methodology could be valuable.- Evaluating their approach on multilingual retrieval tasks using non-English passages, to better understand how it generalizes.- Applying their method to other information retrieval settings beyond open-domain question answering and fact verification, such as conversational search.- Exploring whether coupling their domain adaptation technique with other methods like pretraining objectives could lead to further gains.- Testing the approach with different base encoders for the ColBERTv2 retriever beyond just BERT-Base, such as ELECTRA or RoBERTa encoders.So in summary, some key directions are testing their method with other types of models and tasks, improving the prompting strategies, and combining it with complementary techniques like pretraining objectives or multilingual data. The authors seem focused on pushing the flexibility and generalizability of their approach.
