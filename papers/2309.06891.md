# [Keep It SimPool: Who Said Supervised Transformers Suffer from Attention   Deficit?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06891)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that spatial pooling in convolutional neural networks and vision transformers can be reformulated as a separate module at the end of the network. The authors propose that this unified pooling module, which they call SimPool, can improve performance and provide better attention maps compared to default pooling in both CNNs and transformers. 

The key research questions addressed are:

1. Can a simple pooling mechanism applied at the end improve over default pooling in CNNs and transformers?

2. Can this pooling mechanism provide high quality attention maps that delineate object boundaries in both CNNs and transformers? 

3. Do these benefits hold for both supervised and self-supervised training?

To test these hypotheses, the authors propose SimPool, which is based on cross-attention between the global average pooled features and the final convolutional feature maps. They show that SimPool boosts accuracy and provides sharper attention maps compared to global average pooling in CNNs and the [CLS] token in transformers. The benefits hold for both supervised ImageNet training and self-supervised DINO pretraining.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating pooling as a plug-and-play module can improve performance and attention for both CNNs and ViTs. The key questions address whether SimPool validates this hypothesis across network architectures and training procedures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SimPool, a simple and universal attention-based pooling method that can be used as a replacement for default pooling in convolutional networks and vision transformers. The key points are:

- They formulate a generic pooling framework that allows examining and comparing various pooling methods. Using this, they show that many existing pooling methods like GAP, GeM, SE, CBAM etc. can be seen as instantiations of this framework.

- They propose SimPool, which is a simple non-iterative attention-based pooling that uses global average pooling (GAP) for initialization and cross-attention between the pooled vector and image features for the pooling operation. 

- SimPool is shown to work well as a universal pooling mechanism for both convolutional networks like ResNet and vision transformers like ViT. It improves performance over default pooling and also generates high quality attention maps that focus well on foreground objects.

- This is achieved for both supervised and self-supervised settings. Notably, SimPool produces good attention maps for supervised ViT, something that prior works have struggled with.

- Extensive experiments validate the benefits of SimPool over default pooling and several competitors on image classification, localization, retrieval etc. Tasks and multiple datasets demonstrate its universality.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a simple and universal pooling method SimPool that works for both CNNs and ViT, supervised and self-supervised, improving performance and attention maps. The comparisons using a generic pooling framework is also an important aspect.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces SimPool, a simple attention-based pooling method that can be applied to both convolutional and transformer networks at the end of the encoder to improve performance on pre-training and downstream tasks while also generating clean attention maps that delineate object boundaries under both supervised and self-supervised settings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of vision transformers and spatial pooling:

- This paper proposes a simple and generic spatial pooling framework called SimPool that can be applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers. Most prior work on spatial pooling has focused specifically on either CNNs or transformers.

- The paper shows that by replacing the default pooling mechanism in CNNs and transformers with SimPool, both image classification accuracy and attention map quality can be improved in supervised and self-supervised settings. Most prior work has studied spatial pooling for CNNs on instance-level tasks or for transformers in a self-supervised context. This work validates the benefits of improved pooling in the supervised classification setting as well.

- The paper demonstrates that with SimPool, supervised transformers can achieve attention map quality on par with or better than self-supervised transformers, without needing additional losses or architectural modifications. Prior work has shown supervised transformers generally produce poor quality attention maps compared to self-supervised methods.

- SimPool is shown to work well as a simple drop-in replacement for the pooling layer in existing CNN and transformer architectures. It does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning or architectural changes. Many prior pooling methods are more complex or deeply integrated into the network architecture.

- The paper compares SimPool directly to a range of prior pooling techniques like GAP, GeM, attention-based, etc. in a consistent evaluation framework. This allows for a systematic comparison of the trade-offs between different pooling strategies.

Overall, this paper makes contributions in formulating a simple and generic pooling framework, validating its benefits for both CNNs and transformers in supervised learning, and specifically demonstrating improved attention maps for supervised transformers compared to prior art. The consistent evaluation provides useful insights into spatial pooling design choices.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the key future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Developing optimization methods to enable training deeper transformer models. The paper showed promising results by scaling up model size, so developing techniques to train even larger models could lead to further gains.

- Exploring different tokenization approaches like using 2D tokens instead of 1D. This could allow modeling more spatial relationships in images compared to the current 1D sequence modeling approach. 

- Improving efficiency of attention mechanisms for vision transformers, as the quadratic computation cost can limit scaling. Ideas like sparse attention and conditional computation were suggested.

- Incorporating more inductive biases from convolutional networks like translation equivariance. The paper argues both CNN and transformer approaches have complementary strengths.

- Studying transfer learning abilities of vision transformers on a broader range of visual tasks beyond image classification. Areas like object detection and segmentation represent opportunities.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why vision transformers achieve strong results compared to CNNs. The connections between self-attention and translation equivariance was one direction suggested.

- Exploring the role of pre-training datasets and regularization methods in improving vision transformers. Self-supervised pretraining was noted as being particularly promising.

So in summary, some of the main future directions are developing techniques to scale up model size, improving efficiency of transformers, incorporating convolutional inductive biases, evaluating on more vision tasks, and building theoretical understandings. Leveraging self-supervised pretraining also appears to be a promising direction for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SimPool, a simple attention-based pooling method that can be used at the end of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers. The key idea is to reformulate CNNs and transformers into two streams - one for feature extraction and one for spatial pooling. This allows isolating the pooling mechanism so that it can be replaced with a better design. The authors develop a generic pooling framework and show how several existing pooling methods can be formulated as instantiations. By analyzing the properties of different methods, they propose SimPool which uses global average pooling to initialize a query vector, learns linear mappings to transform features into keys, and uses dot product attention to obtain a spatial attention map. This attention map determines the weights of a generalized weighted average pooling. SimPool placed at the end of CNNs and transformers improves performance on image classification with supervised and self-supervised pretraining. It also provides high quality attention maps that delineate object boundaries, something that was previously only possible with self-supervised transformers. Overall, SimPool offers a simple, unified pooling mechanism for both CNNs and transformers.

\section{Motivation and significance}

The paper identifies and tackles important limitations of existing pooling designs in CNNs and transformers:

- CNN pooling is ad-hoc, while transformer pooling uses the CLS token which provides poor attention maps under supervision. 

- There is no unified pooling mechanism that works equally well for both CNNs and transformers.

The proposed SimPool pooling addresses these issues and demonstrates improved performance and attention maps across diverse network architectures and training methods. The simple and unified design is a noteworthy contribution.

By reformulating pooling as an isolated mechanism, the paper also provides a framework for analyzing and comparing different pooling strategies. This is valuable for inspecting existing methods and designing new ones. 

The gains on multiple benchmarks highlight the significance and potential impact of SimPool. Its applicability to both CNNs and transformers means it could become a standard replacement for default pooling in many vision models.

\section{Technical quality}

The paper is technically strong overall:

- The generic pooling framework covers a wide range of methods. Formulating existing techniques as instantiations demonstrates its flexibility.

- The design of SimPool is intuitive, aligning with the motivations from analyzing prior pooling strategies. The method itself is simple yet effective.

- The extensive experiments systematically validate SimPool across diverse scenarios using standard benchmarks and metrics. The consistent gains support the claims.

- The visualizations of attention maps provide qualitative evidence that SimPool better focuses on foreground objects compared to default pooling.

Some aspects that could be improved:

- The framework currently does not cover iterative methods optimizing an auxiliary loss like RTC~\cite{rtc}. Extending it could make the taxonomy more comprehensive.

- More ablation experiments on design choices would strengthen the motivation for SimPool's specific formulation.

- Visualizations are shown for ViT~\cite{vit} but not CNN backbones; seeing attention maps across architectures could be insightful.

Overall the technical quality is high - the methodology is thorough and evaluations sufficiently rigorous. The results convincingly demonstrate the capabilities of SimPool as a unified pooling mechanism for vision networks.

\section{Originality}

The paper proposes a novel pooling strategy and makes several original contributions:

- SimPool itself is an original method providing unified pooling for CNNs and transformers. The simple attention-based design outperforms default pooling across settings.

- The generic pooling framework for systematically analyzing methods is an original conceptual contribution. It enables direct comparison of different techniques under a unified lens.

- Reformulating pooling as an isolated mechanism independent of feature extraction is an original idea. This allows swapping in better designs like SimPool.

- Obtaining good attention maps from supervised transformers, on par with self-supervised ones, is highly novel and counters accepted notions.

- The consistent gains from SimPool are non-obvious. That a simple plug-in pooling can boost performance across diverse models, architectures and training paradigms is an original finding.

Some limitations in originality:

- Attention-based pooling has been explored before, so SimPool builds incrementally on prior ideas like HOW~\cite{how}.

- The parameterized weighted average pooling has similarities to previous work like GeM~\cite{gem}.

- The overall approach of analyzing and improving CNN and transformer pooling follows recent trends in self-attention~\cite{cotr} and architecture designs~\cite{mixer}.

Overall, I find the paper to make sufficiently novel contributions within the context of related work. The most original aspects are the unified pooling framework, reformulation as an isolated mechanism, and practical gains from the simple yet effective SimPool across models and settings.

\section{Clarity}

The paper is clearly structured and well-written overall:

- The introduction provides good motivation and clearly sets up the research questions.

- Background covers the most relevant work on CNN and transformer pooling.

- The method section describes the framework, analyses, and SimPool design in a structured manner. The algorithm summarizes SimPool. 

- Experiments systematically evaluate different aspects with sufficient details.

- The paper is technically sound, with clear explanation of concepts. Figures and tables effectively summarize key results.

Some suggestions to further improve clarity:

- The high-level pooling landscape at the start could be illustrated visually to better motivate the analyses and SimPool's place.

- Explicitly listing the key limitations identified from analyzing prior methods can better motivate SimPool's design.

- More intuition on why weighted averaging with an attention map works well for unified pooling could make the approach more accessible.

- Some parts like additional related work are more suited for supplementary material to enhance focus.

Overall, the paper communicates the key ideas and contributions effectively. The presentation and organization follow standard academic conventions. Additional illustrations and intuition can further improve accessibility.

\section{Summary}

In summary, I find this to be a strong paper with highly novel contributions around a simple, unified pooling strategy. The motivated design, thorough evaluations, and consistent gains highlight SimPool's significance as a drop-in replacement for default pooling. Some aspects like the framework coverage, design motivations, and presentation can be enhanced further, but the overall quality is high. The paper tackles an important problem and advances the state-of-the-art meaningfully. I recommend acceptance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new attention-based pooling method called SimPool that can be applied to both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. The key idea is to replace the default pooling mechanism at the end of the encoder with a simple cross-attention operation. Specifically, the pooled representation is initialized by global average pooling (GAP). This pooled vector is then used as a query to attend over the feature map from the last encoder layer, which serves as the keys. The attention weights are used to weighted average pool the features to get the final representation. 

SimPool is shown to provide several benefits. First, it consistently improves performance on image classification with both convolutional and transformer encoders, under both supervised and self-supervised pre-training. Second, it generates high quality attention maps that focus on semantic objects, even with supervision. Prior works have only achieved this with self-supervision. Third, the benefits transfer to various downstream tasks including object localization, discovery, and robustness to background changes. Overall, SimPool provides a simple, unified pooling mechanism that works across network architectures and training regimes. The design of using cross-attention between a learned query and encoder features provides more discriminative pooling than default GAP or cls token pooling.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Keep It SimPool: Who Said Supervised Transformers Suffer from Attention Deficit?":

The paper proposes a new pooling method called SimPool that can be applied to the end of both convolutional and transformer encoder networks. SimPool is based on an attention mechanism where the network first computes a query vector using global average pooling (GAP) of the input features. It then computes attention weights between this query vector and a key matrix obtained from the input features. These attention weights are used to take a weighted average of the input features to obtain the final pooled vector representation. Unlike prior work, SimPool is able to produce high quality attention maps that focus on the main object even for supervised training, unlike the poor quality attention maps normally produced by supervised transformers. The authors show that SimPool improves performance on various supervised and self-supervised pre-training benchmarks across convolutional and transformer networks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Keep It SimPool: Who Said Supervised Transformers Suffer from Attention Deficit?" is addressing the following main problems/questions:

1. Can we design a simple and unified pooling mechanism that works well at the end of both convolutional networks and vision transformers? The default global pooling used in these models is quite different, with convolutional nets doing spatial pooling and transformers using a learnable [CLS] token. The paper explores whether the pooling operation itself needs to be so different between the two model families.

2. Can this unified pooling method provide high-quality attention maps that delineate object boundaries, for both convolutional and transformer encoders? Self-supervised transformers can produce good attention maps but supervised ones usually don't. The paper investigates whether supervision is inherently problematic or whether the pooling mechanism is the issue. 

3. Do the benefits of the proposed pooling approach hold under both supervised and self-supervised training settings? Most prior work has focused just on self-supervision.

To summarize, the key goals are developing a unified pooling mechanism for vision models, using it to produce better attention maps in both supervised and self-supervised settings, and showing consistent benefits across diverse model architectures and training paradigms. The paper aims to simplify and improve pooling while providing insights into attention quality in supervised transformers.
