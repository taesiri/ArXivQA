# [Video Action Recognition with Attentive Semantic Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09756)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can visual-language models (VLMs) like CLIP be better leveraged for action video recognition by exploiting finer-grained semantic information beyond just the action label names? The key ideas and hypotheses proposed in the paper are:- Action labels themselves are abstract concepts. Directly mapping videos to action label text embeddings may not fully capture all the relevant semantics.- Relating action labels to more fine-grained "semantic units" like objects, body parts, scenes, motions can provide richer and more explanatory semantics to guide video representation learning.- Attending to relevant semantic units in frames using region-aware visual features can help capture finer visual-text alignments compared to global frame features alone.- Using selected semantic units to guide the cross-modal decoding of spatiotemporal video features can produce more discriminative and transferable representations.- This approach of using semantic units can boost performance in both fully-supervised learning and few-shot/zero-shot transfer scenarios.In summary, the key hypothesis is that exploiting finer-grained semantics beyond just action labels through semantic units can allow VLMs to learn better video representations for action recognition, especially for transfer learning. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed techniques.
