# [MoE-Infinity: Activation-Aware Expert Offloading for Efficient MoE   Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14361)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deploying large mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for real-time AI services is challenging due to their massive memory requirements. A promising approach is to offload model parameters to external memory like SSDs and fetch them on-demand. However, existing offloading systems exhibit high latency overheads from excessive prefetching traffic and low cache hit ratios, limiting their practical usage.

Key Idea: 
The authors observe that MoE models exhibit sparse expert activation and temporal locality during inference when serving small batches of requests, typical in interactive services. By tracking expert activation patterns in these requests, accurate predictions of future expert usage can guide selective prefetching and informed caching of experts to GPU memory for low latency.  

Proposed Solution - MoE-Infinity:
1. Sequence-level expert activation tracing: Maintains fine-grained traces of expert activation for individual requests to preserve sparsity and locality patterns aggregated tracing would lose. Uses Expert Activation Matrices (EAM) and selectively retains representative traces in an EAM Collection (EAMC).

2. Activation-aware expert prefetching: Leverages current EAM and similarity search on EAMC to predict next experts to activate. Prioritizes prefetch requests based on predicted activation ratio and nearness to layer executing currently for timely prefetching.  

3. Activation-aware expert caching: Favors retaining in GPU cache experts with higher current activation ratios and from initial layers. Integrates caching with prefetching pipeline.

Key Results:
Evaluations using real-world models like Switch Transformers and workloads show MoE-Infinity reduces tail latency by 20x and deployment costs by 8x over state-of-the-art offloading systems. Microbenchmarks also demonstrate benefits of specialized prefetching, caching and tracing strategies to effectively leverage activation sparsity and locality.  

Key Contributions: 
1) Exploits expert activation patterns in MoE inference for efficient offloading 
2) Realizes fine-grained sequence-level activation tracing for retaining sparsity  
3) Develops activation-aware strategies for expert prefetching and caching
4) Implemented system outperforming existing approaches significantly


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents MoE-Infinity, a new serving system for mixture-of-experts models that realizes activation-aware expert offloading through sequence-level expert activation tracing, activation-aware expert prefetching, and activation-aware expert caching to substantially reduce latency and cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of MoE-Infinity (MoEI), a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) serving system that realizes activation-aware expert offloading. Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

1. It proposes the concept of activation-aware expert offloading to leverage the sparse activation and temporal locality inherent in MoE models during inference. This allows for more efficient prefetching and caching of model parameters.

2. It introduces sequence-level expert activation tracing, which tracks the sparse activation patterns of experts at an individual sequence level during inference. This captures nuances that get obscured when aggregation is done across sequences.

3. It develops activation-aware expert prefetching, which continuously adjusts prefetching priorities for experts based on predicted activation ratios and the expert's proximity to the layer being executed. 

4. It implements activation-aware expert caching, which prioritizes caching experts likely to be reused or that cannot be effectively prefetched.

5. It realizes the above ideas in the MoEI system and demonstrates significant improvements in latency, throughput, and cost efficiency over state-of-the-art systems like Zero-Infinity, Zero-Offload, PyTorch+Unified Memory, etc. when serving various MoE models.

In summary, the key contribution is the design and implementation of the MoEI system for efficient and low-latency serving of MoE models via activation-aware expert offloading.
