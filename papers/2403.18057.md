# [Prioritized League Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Heterogeneous   Multiagent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18057)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses challenges in large-scale heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems, which contain diverse agents with different abilities. Compared to homogeneous systems, heterogeneous systems offer practical benefits but face issues like non-stationarity and difficulty balancing different agent types.

- Existing MARL methods focus on homogeneous agents and do not explicitly address heterogeneous systems. Some methods handle heterogeneity in specific domains but lack general applicability to large-scale heterogeneous cooperation problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Prioritized Heterogeneous League Reinforcement Learning (PHLRL) to enable effective decentralized cooperation in large-scale heterogeneous multi-agent systems. 

- PHLRL maintains a heterogeneous league containing diverse historical policies to improve robustness. Agents train by cooperating with league policies in addition to the current frontier policy.

- A prioritized advantage coefficient compensates for differences in sample counts across agent types. This addresses varying difficulties for essential but rare agent types.

- The method uses a hypernetwork-based policy structure to help agents adapt to different teammates and policy combinations during training.

Contributions:
- Proposes PHLRL, a novel MARL algorithm to handle challenges specific to large-scale heterogeneous multiagent cooperation.

- Introduces prioritized advantage coefficients to resolve sample inequality across heterogeneous agents.

- Presents adaptive hypernetwork policies to promote effective collaboration despite differences in partners.

- Designs a new heterogeneous multiagent benchmark environment called Large-Scale Heterogeneous Cooperation (LSHC) using Unreal Engine.

- Demonstrates through experiments that PHLRL exceeds state-of-the-art baselines like QMIX and QPLEX in addressing decentralized cooperation in the LSHC task environment.

In summary, the key novelty is PHLRL, which enables scalable and sample-efficient decentralized MARL in complex heterogeneous multiagent systems where agents have differing capabilities. Experiments show it outperforms prior algorithms.
