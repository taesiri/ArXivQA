# [Self-Supervised Video Desmoking for Laparoscopic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Surgical smoke generated during laparoscopic surgery obscures visual details and impedes surgeons' decision making. Desmoking (removing smoke digitally from images/videos) is an effective solution.  
- However, existing methods either train on simulated smoke (doesn't generalize to real smoke) or are ill-posed for dense real-world smoke. Lack of real-world paired surgical data is also an issue.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Self-Supervised Video Desmoking (SelfSVD) by utilizing inherent characteristics of real surgery videos for self-supervision.
- Key ideas:
   1) Use pre-smoke (PS) frame with less smoke as unaligned supervision for smoky frames. Employ deformation loss using optical flow to match outputs with PS frame supervision.
   2) Also use PS frame as additional input reference to guide smoke removal, especially helping with dense smoke. Introduce masking strategy and regularization to avoid trivial solutions.
   3) Further enhance PS frame using pre-trained SelfSVD, and use enhanced version as improved supervision.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to leverage real-world laparoscopic surgery videos for self-supervised smoke removal, circumventing lack of paired data.
- Techniques to effectively utilize PS frame - as supervision, additional input and enhanced supervision.
- Strategies like masking and regularization to prevent trivial solutions.  
- Collected and will release first real-world laparoscopic surgery video dataset with smoke for research.
- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art smoke removal and detail recovery on real-world surgical smoke, especially effective on dense smoke.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative self-supervised video desmoking solution that can effectively remove dense real-world surgical smoke by sufficiently leveraging inherent characteristics of laparoscopic surgery videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-supervised video desmoking method for laparoscopic surgery, which utilizes the pre-smoke frame as supervision and additional input to effectively remove smoke from real-world surgical videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a self-supervised surgery video desmoking (SelfSVD) method that utilizes the internal characteristics of real-world surgery videos for effective smoke removal. Specifically, it takes the pre-smoke (PS) frame as unaligned supervision and additional reference input to guide the desmoking of other frames.

2. It introduces strategies including a masking strategy and a regularization term to prevent trivial solutions when taking the PS frame as reference input.

3. It constructs a real-world laparoscopic surgery video desmoking (LSVD) dataset that contains diverse and complex smoke scenes, which can benefit future research in this direction.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SelfSVD method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in removing smoke and recovering photo-realistic details. It also presents lightweight models for real-time application.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective self-supervised framework (SelfSVD) for real-world surgery video desmoking by sufficiently exploiting the internal characteristics of such videos and constructing a new dataset (LSVD) to facilitate research along this line.
