# [CompdVision: Combining Near-Field 3D Visual and Tactile Sensing Using a   Compact Compound-Eye Imaging System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional approaches for robotic manipulation often use bulky external depth cameras along with tactile sensors. This leads to issues like occlusion, limited close-up sensing ability, and large overall system size. Prior efforts on combining visual and tactile sensing in one compact unit faced problems like image clarity, inability to operate both modalities simultaneously, and large size.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces CompdVision, a novel compact (22x14x14 mm) sensor that combines both 3D visual and tactile sensing by leveraging a micro-scale compound-eye imaging system. It features a 3x5 grid of vision units - two side stereo pairs for far-field depth sensing and nine central tactile units with near-focus lenses to perceive contact deformation. The transparency of the touching subsystem allows the stereo units to see through while the tactile units track marker displacements. This unique configuration enables the simultaneous capture of external 3D visual data along with high-resolution tactile data.

Main Contributions:

- A compound-eye imaging system that combines both 3D visual and tactile sensing modalities into a single compact unit
- Achieves near-field depth sensing up to 70mm range from sensor surface using micro-scale stereo vision units
- Tactile units with near-focus lenses provide detailed high-resolution tactile data 
- Simultaneous operation of both sensing modalities
- Compact sensor design for easy integration into robotic systems

In experiments, the sensor demonstrated reliable depth estimation within 70mm range and accurate tangential and normal force measurements. Tests during a grasping task showcase the simultaneous capturing of evolving 3D visual and tactile signals throughout the process. The compact multi-modal design makes this sensor well-suited for complex robotic manipulation tasks.
