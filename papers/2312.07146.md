# [CompdVision: Combining Near-Field 3D Visual and Tactile Sensing Using a   Compact Compound-Eye Imaging System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07146)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces CompdVision, a novel compact (22x14x14mm) robotic sensor that uniquely combines near-field 3D visual and tactile sensing capabilities into a single unit utilizing a micro-scale compound-eye imaging system. It features a 3x5 grid of vision units, with the units in the corners specialized for stereo depth estimation to facilitate external scene tracking, while the central units are optimized for precisely tracking the displacement of markers embedded in a transparent elastomer skin for tactile sensing. This enables the simultaneous capture of contact deformation information and depth data beyond the contact surface. The stereo vision system, calibrated using parameters like focal length and lens distortion, leverages image rectification and semi-global block matching to register high accuracy (med RMSE<1.2%) in depth mapping within 70mm. Meanwhile, the tactile units employ techniques like image stitching, color thresholding and blob detection to extract 2D marker displacements. A CNN model then effectively estimates contact forces in 3 axes, with RMSE of 0.15N on the tangential forces and 0.19N on normal forces. The successful combination of compact form factor, precise near-field depth sensing unaffected by occlusion, and detailed tactile data acquisition from a structurally integrated soft skin makes CompdVision a versatile and valuable tool for enhancing robotic manipulation capabilities.
