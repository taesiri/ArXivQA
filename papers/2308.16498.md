# [Generalised Winograd Schema and its Contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) was proposed as an alternative to the Turing Test to evaluate machine intelligence by testing a system's ability to resolve ambiguous pronouns. 
- However, the original WSC lacks the complexity to exhibit contextuality when modeled within the sheaf-theoretic framework of contextuality. Deterministic systems like the original WSC cannot host contextuality.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors generalize the WSC to add more ambiguity and convert it to a non-deterministic system that resembles a Bell-CHSH scenario. 
- Specifically, they introduce an additional ambiguous pronoun and a new pair of special/alternate words to construct the Generalized Winograd Schema.

- They provide an example of such a schema and collect human judgments of it via crowdsourcing. The empirical model built from the judgments violates the Bell-CHSH inequality, demonstrating contextuality.

Main Contributions:
- Identified that the original WSC is too simplistic to exhibit contextuality when modeled in the sheaf-theoretic framework.

- Proposed a novel generalization of the WSC by adding linguistic complexity to make it resemble a Bell-CHSH scenario capable of hosting contextuality.  

- Provided a specific example of the proposed Generalized Winograd Schema and empirically demonstrated its contextuality through crowdsourced human judgments.

- Opened up new research directions like using the generalized WSC as a testbed for contextuality in language and utilizing language models to automatically construct contextual empirical models.

In summary, the key innovation is the generalization of the WSC to host contextuality, which is empirically demonstrated. This connects contextuality research to the long-standing challenge of pronoun resolution in NLP.
