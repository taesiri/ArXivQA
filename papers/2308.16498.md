# [Generalised Winograd Schema and its Contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) was proposed as an alternative to the Turing Test to evaluate machine intelligence by testing a system's ability to resolve ambiguous pronouns. 
- However, the original WSC lacks the complexity to exhibit contextuality when modeled within the sheaf-theoretic framework of contextuality. Deterministic systems like the original WSC cannot host contextuality.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors generalize the WSC to add more ambiguity and convert it to a non-deterministic system that resembles a Bell-CHSH scenario. 
- Specifically, they introduce an additional ambiguous pronoun and a new pair of special/alternate words to construct the Generalized Winograd Schema.

- They provide an example of such a schema and collect human judgments of it via crowdsourcing. The empirical model built from the judgments violates the Bell-CHSH inequality, demonstrating contextuality.

Main Contributions:
- Identified that the original WSC is too simplistic to exhibit contextuality when modeled in the sheaf-theoretic framework.

- Proposed a novel generalization of the WSC by adding linguistic complexity to make it resemble a Bell-CHSH scenario capable of hosting contextuality.  

- Provided a specific example of the proposed Generalized Winograd Schema and empirically demonstrated its contextuality through crowdsourced human judgments.

- Opened up new research directions like using the generalized WSC as a testbed for contextuality in language and utilizing language models to automatically construct contextual empirical models.

In summary, the key innovation is the generalization of the WSC to host contextuality, which is empirically demonstrated. This connects contextuality research to the long-standing challenge of pronoun resolution in NLP.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper generalizes the Winograd Schema by introducing additional ambiguity, collects human judgments on an example instance, and shows the resulting empirical model exhibits contextuality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a generalization of the Winograd Schema by introducing additional ambiguous pronouns and word pairs. This results in a scenario resembling the Bell-CHSH scenario that can exhibit contextuality. 

2. Presenting an example of the generalized Winograd Schema and collecting human judgments on it via crowdsourcing. The empirical model constructed from the human judgments is shown to violate the Bell-CHSH inequality, thus demonstrating contextuality.

So in summary, the main contributions are generalizing the Winograd Schema to allow for contextuality and showing an example of this using human judgments that leads to an empirical model that exhibits contextuality.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC)
- Contextuality 
- Sheaf-theoretic framework
- Measurement scenarios
- Quantum contextuality
- Bell-CHSH scenario
- Generalized Winograd Schema 
- Crowdsourcing
- Bootstrap resampling
- Bell-CHSH inequality violation
- Significance testing
- Generative language models

The paper discusses modeling the Winograd Schema Challenge using ideas from quantum contextuality and the sheaf-theoretic framework. It points out limitations of the original WSC and proposes a generalized version that resembles the Bell-CHSH scenario. Human judgments are collected via crowdsourcing to construct an empirical model that demonstrates contextuality. Key methods include testing Bell-CHSH inequality violations and using bootstrap resampling to establish significance. The paper also suggests leveraging generative language models to automatically construct more examples of the generalized schema. So these are some of the central terms and concepts featured.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes generalizing the Winograd Schema by introducing additional ambiguity through a second pronoun and alternate word pair. What is the rationale behind this approach? Does increasing ambiguity necessarily increase the complexity and contextuality of the schema?

2. The measurement scenarios derived from the generalized Winograd Schema are claimed to resemble the Bell-CHSH scenario. In what specific ways are they similar or different? Could you describe the precise mapping between elements of the linguistic schema and components of a Bell test?  

3. What assumptions were made in modelling the ambiguous pronouns and alternate words as observables and measurement contexts? How reasonable are these assumptions and what impact could they have on the resultant models?

4. The paper argues that the original Winograd Schema was too simplistic to exhibit contextuality. What key properties make deterministic or nearly deterministic systems like the original schema non-contextual?

5. What steps were taken to ensure symmetry between the noun phrases and eliminate the possibility of signalling in the experimental model? Why was this an important consideration in assessing contextuality? 

6. While the Bell-CHSH inequality was used to witness contextuality, what would using the Contextuality by Default framework reveal about the nature (cyclic, acyclic etc.) of contextuality exhibited by the schema?

7. What implications does the significance level of 87% for contextuality have? What factors likely contributed to samples that did not exhibit contextuality?  

8. How exactly was the crowdsourcing experiment designed and what measures were taken to validate responses? What biases could this introduce into the collected judgement data?

9. The paper suggests using language models to automatically generate examples of the generalized Winograd Schema. What challenges exist in producing valid, naturally sounding schemas in this manner?

10. What similarities or differences do you expect between human responses and language model-generated responses for such schemas? Why?
