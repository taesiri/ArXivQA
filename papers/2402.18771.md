# [NARUTO: Neural Active Reconstruction from Uncertain Target Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18771)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NARUTO: Neural Active Reconstruction from Uncertain Target Observations":

Problem:
- Active reconstruction refers to the problem of actively controlling a camera to maximize the completeness and quality of reconstructing an unknown 3D scene. Prior works have limitations in speed and ability to handle unconstrained 6DOF motion.

Solution:
- The paper proposes NARUTO, the first neural active reconstruction system for unconstrained 6DOF movement. 
- It uses a hybrid neural scene representation that combines implicit neural fields with explicit hash-encoded features for efficient mapping.
- A novel uncertainty learning module is proposed to quantify reconstruction uncertainty in real-time. This uses an explicit uncertainty volume that is more stable than standard implicit uncertainty networks.
- For planning, a new uncertainty aggregation strategy efficiently finds the next best view that observes the largest uncertain space. Efficient path planning uses an adapted RRT algorithm.
- An active ray sampling module focuses sampling on uncertain rays to enhance mapping stability.

Main Contributions:
- First neural active reconstruction system for unconstrained 6DOF movement in large spaces
- Real-time uncertainty learning module with a more stable explicit uncertainty volume 
- Uncertainty-aware planning for efficient next best view and trajectory planning
- General active ray sampling module to improve neural mapping methods
- State-of-the-art active reconstruction completeness (90%) on Replica and Matterport3D datasets

In summary, NARUTO advances neural active reconstruction by enabling unconstrained motion and leveraging learned uncertainty to actively control observation to maximize scene completeness and quality. The methods for uncertainty modeling, planning, and sampling provide generalizable ways to improve active neural mapping.
