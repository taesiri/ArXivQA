# [Semantic Human Mesh Reconstruction with Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing highly realistic and editable 3D human meshes from images is very useful for applications like gaming, VR, and digital avatars. However, current methods have limitations in reliability, mesh quality, lack of UV unwrapping/skinning weights, and texture quality. They struggle with incomplete data, blurry results, missing body parts, and unusable texture maps.

Solution - SHERT:
This paper proposes SHERT, a novel pipeline to reconstruct high-quality semantic human meshes with textures from detailed 3D surfaces or images. SHERT has four main steps:

1) Sampling: Apply semantic- and normal-based sampling between a detailed surface and SMPL-X model to get a partial semantic mesh.

2) Completion: Use a self-supervised network to complete the partial mesh by converting 3D completion to 2D UV inpainting. Leverage SMPL-X priors for robustness.

3) Refinement: Further enhance geometric details using images and normal maps with a UV-based self-supervised network.

4) Texturing: Sample texture map from images/surfaces and use a text-driven diffusion model for high-res UV inpainting/generation.

Main Contributions:

- Propose SHERT pipeline to reconstruct robust and fully textured semantic human avatars from images or surfaces  

- Novel semantic- and normal-based sampling for non-rigid registration, works even with incomplete/inaccurate data

- Self-supervised networks for mesh completion and refinement in UV space, leveraging SMPL-X priors

- High-quality texture generation/inpainting using a fine-tuned diffusion model conditioned on images/text  

- Reconstructed meshes have stable UVs, clean topology, and skinning weights for animation and editing

- Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate SHERT generates superior semantic meshes and textures compared to state-of-the-art

In summary, SHERT robustly reconstructs high-fidelity, animatable and editable semantic human avatars with realistic textures from images or surfaces, outperforming previous state-of-the-art. The semantic representation and well-designed components make the results very practical for real applications.
