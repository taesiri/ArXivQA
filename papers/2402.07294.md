# [On the Effectiveness of Machine Learning-based Call Graph Pruning: An   Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Constructing precise static call graphs is challenging due to over-approximation leading to false edges. Recent ML-based call graph pruning approaches suffer from: (1) lack of suitable benchmark datasets, (2) imbalanced training data due to over-approximation, (3) significant recall drop after pruning, and (4) no comparison with context-sensitive call graph algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced NYXCorpus benchmark by combining 3 datasets - NJR-1, XCorpus and YCorpus (added new dataset YCorpus)
- Use conservative strategy during training and inference to improve recall 
- Compared pruned 0-CFA call graphs with 1-CFA call graphs
- Evaluated pruned call graphs on a vulnerability analysis use case

Main Contributions:
- Created new benchmark dataset NYXCorpus with Java programs of various sizes including real-world ones
- Adapted ML models to support weighted training and customizable pruning via confidence levels
- Presented an empirical study evaluating effectiveness of ML-based call graph pruning, studying current issues, proposing solutions like conservative strategies, and evaluating their effects
- Showed pruned call graphs have comparable quality to 1-CFA analysis while being 3.5x faster with 69% smaller size, with virtually unchanged vulnerability analysis results

In summary, the paper identifies issues with current ML-based call graph pruning approaches, proposes enhancements to address them, introduces a new benchmark dataset, and empirically evaluates the solutions, demonstrating improved precision while maintaining high recall and use case applicability.
