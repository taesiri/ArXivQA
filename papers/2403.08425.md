# [Specification Overfitting in Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08425)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems are often criticized for bias, lack of transparency and robustness. Regulators struggle to translate high-level principles like fairness into concrete metrics that can be measured.
- Specifications are concrete proxies trying to measure high-level goals like fairness. But specifying a complex goal necessarily involves tradeoffs and assumptions.
- Optimizing for narrow specifications could lead to "specification overfitting": improving the metric but degrading performance on the actual goal and other metrics. 

Solution:
- The paper defines and analyzes the problem of specification overfitting across AI fields.
- It presents a literature review categorizing how 74 papers propose, measure and optimize specifications in AI domains like NLP, CV and RL.

Key Contributions:
- First paper to define and systematically study specification overfitting.
- Provides a structured analysis of common practices around specifications in AI papers.
- Finds that most papers don't discuss the role specifications should play in system development or make explicit the assumptions behind formulations.
- Develops an evaluation scheme assessing whether papers analyze specification overfitting by reporting multiple specifications and studying impact on task performance.
- Extracts recommendations from papers on using specifications, finding very few concrete guidelines.

Conclusion:
- Concrete metrics will be increasingly important for AI regulations, raising risks of narrowly over-optimizing them. 
- Researchers should be more explicit about measurement assumptions and provide actionable recommendations on using specifications during development.
- Evaluation schemes, best practices and analysis frameworks are needed for reliably developing AI systems with multiple potentially competing metrics.
