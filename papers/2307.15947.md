# [The effect of network topologies on fully decentralized learning: a   preliminary investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15947)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates how different network topologies affect the performance of a machine learning model trained in a fully decentralized way through direct collaboration between nodes. Specifically, it studies how the "spreading of knowledge", i.e. the ability of nodes to incorporate information learned from data available at other nodes, is impacted by the structure of the connections between the nodes.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a decentralized learning algorithm called DecAvg, which is an extension of the popular Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to decentralized settings. In DecAvg, each node trains a model on its local data, averages the models received from its neighbors weighted by edge strengths, retrains the averaged model on its local data, and shares the updated model with its neighbors. This process repeats for several rounds.

The authors evaluate DecAvg on three different network topologies - Erdos-Renyi graphs, Barabasi-Albert graphs, and Stochastic Block Model graphs. These graphs have different properties in terms of degree distribution and community structure. The MNIST dataset is used, with its classes partitioned non-IID across nodes in different ways depending on the graph structure.

Main Contributions:

- Initial data distribution across high degree vs low degree nodes significantly impacts final accuracy. Knowledge spreads easily when high degree nodes have more knowledge.

- In Erdos-Renyi graphs, increased connectivity helps when knowledge starts from high degree nodes, but hurts when it starts from low degree nodes because it dilutes their knowledge.

- In Barabasi-Albert graphs, hubs effectively spread knowledge irrespective of rest of network structure. For low degree nodes, increased connectivity marginally helps accuracy.

- In Stochastic Block Model graphs, knowledge transfer across communities is very difficult due to presence of tightly knit modules. Even a few inter-community links do not help significantly.

In summary, the paper provides useful insights into how topological properties like degree distribution, connectivity, and modularity affect decentralized learning performance. The results highlight the different roles of hubs vs peripheral nodes in propagating knowledge.
