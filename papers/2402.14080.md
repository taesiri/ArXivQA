# [Efficient Normalized Conformal Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification   for Anti-Cancer Drug Sensitivity Prediction with Deep Regression Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14080)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models are being used more for critical decision making, yet they only provide point predictions without confidence estimates. 
- Providing uncertainty estimates along with predictions can increase trustworthiness of models.  
- Conformal prediction (CP) is a method to provide prediction intervals, but typical CP methods fail to capture heterogeneity of errors across samples.

Proposed Solution:
- Use deep regression forests (DRFs) to estimate sample-level uncertainty for normalized CP. 
- DRF variance aggregated from leaf node mixtures can act as sample uncertainty.
- Compare DRF variance to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) and random forest residual prediction for normalization.

Experiments:
- Apply different CP methods to anti-cancer drug response prediction using Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset.
- DRF normalization provides most efficient intervals and accurate conditional coverage across targets.
- DRF variance had highest correlation to errors compared to MCD and RF residuals.

Contributions:
- First use of DRF variance for normalized CP sample uncertainty quantification.
- DRF CP shows improved efficiency and conditional validity over traditional CP methods.
- Results indicate suitability of DRF CP for providing uncertainty estimates in healthcare applications.

In summary, the paper proposes using DRF variance for normalized conformal prediction to improve predictive confidence estimates. Experiments on a drug response dataset show DRF CP provides more efficient and conditionally valid intervals compared to standard approaches. The method could increase trust in uncertainty estimates for critical medical decision making.
