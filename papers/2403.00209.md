# [ChartReformer: Natural Language-Driven Chart Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Chart images are widely used to visualize data but editing them is difficult without access to the underlying data and plotting code. This limits adapting charts for different applications like highlighting certain data or improving accessibility. Traditional methods rely on manual work, original data tables, and expertise with plotting software parameters.

Solution - ChartReformer:
The paper proposes ChartReformer, a natural language-driven solution to edit chart images directly without needing the original data or plot settings. It allows edits spanning - visual style, layout, converting between chart types, and manipulating the underlying data.

Key ideas:
- Defines and standardizes various types of chart edits like style, layout, format, and data-centric.
- Generated a dataset of ~70K image pairs covering these edit types using real-world data tables.
- ChartReformer predicts the underlying data table and visual attributes from the input chart image. The prompts are used to guide edits to these predictions.
- A replotter software then constructs the edited chart using the predicted parameters. This avoids directly predicting plotting code which is challenging.

Results:
- Evaluations on the dataset show ChartReformer can interpret prompts to accurately edit charts with ~99% plotting success rate. 
- It has higher fidelity than prior work ChartLlama, especially on style and format edits.
- Limitations include lower performance on data manipulation and handling arbitrary complex prompts.

In summary, ChartReformer demonstrates a novel chart image editing approach using natural language guidance, without needing access to original data or settings. The decomposed prediction and replotting strategy also enables more robust edits.
