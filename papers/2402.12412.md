# [Dynamic and Super-Personalized Media Ecosystem Driven by Generative AI:   Unpredictable Plays Never Repeating The Same](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper discusses the potential of using generative AI models at the receiver side to transform media broadcasting. Traditional broadcasting relies on distributing finished media content from the provider's production house. This can lead to repetitive and fatiguing content for viewers, especially for short videos and ads. The paper envisions a new media ecosystem where broadcasters provide lightweight "semantic sources" that spark generative models on user devices to compose personalized media experiences.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes prompt-driven media (PDM) systems where broadcasters transmit "prompt packages" instead of full media content. These packages contain text descriptions, images, layouts, APIs etc. that serve as prompts for an on-device generative content generator (CG). The CG uses techniques like text-to-image, image-to-video and narrative generation to compose media experiences personalized for each user. 

The paper suggests standardized structures for prompt packages to ensure broad compatibility across devices. It also proposes multi-prompt operations where a user device combines prompts from different providers, both synchronously and asynchronously, leading to dynamic content assembly. Location-based prompts and user customization modules further enhance personalization.

Main Contributions:

- Concept of PDM systems for next-generation broadcasting using on-device generative AI
- Comprehensive system design spanning single- and multi-source operations, prompt packaging, receiver workflows etc.  
- Vision for super-personalized and dynamic media experiences via combinatory prompt mechanics
- Discussions around optimization of prompt structure, context coherence, efficiency, standardization etc.
- Use cases benefiting fatigue-resistance, efficiency, precise ad targeting etc.
- Overall framework to transform broadcasting using semantics and on-device creativity

In summary, the paper explores a generative AI-powered media ecosystem that promises personalized and dynamic experiences while enhancing delivery efficiency. The concept aligns broadcasting evolution with contemporary AI advancements towards more creative and adaptive networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new media broadcasting model where generative AI models at the receiver generate personalized video content from lightweight semantic inputs transmitted over the network, enabling more efficient delivery and dynamic user experiences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new media service model that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) video generators at the receiver end. Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) A prompt-driven media (PDM) system where receivers are generative, meaning they can compose media content from received semantic data called "prompt packages". This shifts some of the content creation burden from broadcasters to receivers.

2) Definitions for components of the system like generative receive terminals (GRTs), content generators (CGs), prompt supply networks (PSNs), etc. 

3) Operations for single prompt source ($O_S$) and multi-prompt sources ($O_M$) to allow combining prompt packages in different ways to increase diversity and personalization of content.

4) Use cases for the proposed system, especially for short-form content where fatigue is common (e.g. ads). The system allows refreshing content while requiring less data transfer compared to traditional encoded video.

5) Ideas for standardizing prompt design to ensure broad compatibility across different GRTs and PSNs. This includes using structured formats tailored for each modality.

In summary, the paper explores a new media ecosystem facilitated by receiver-embedded generative models, featuring both random content dynamics and enhanced delivery efficiency. The main novelty is shifting part of the content creation to the receiver side and introducing prompt-based mechanisms to achieve these goals.
