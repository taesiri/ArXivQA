# [Dynamic and Super-Personalized Media Ecosystem Driven by Generative AI:   Unpredictable Plays Never Repeating The Same](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper discusses the potential of using generative AI models at the receiver side to transform media broadcasting. Traditional broadcasting relies on distributing finished media content from the provider's production house. This can lead to repetitive and fatiguing content for viewers, especially for short videos and ads. The paper envisions a new media ecosystem where broadcasters provide lightweight "semantic sources" that spark generative models on user devices to compose personalized media experiences.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes prompt-driven media (PDM) systems where broadcasters transmit "prompt packages" instead of full media content. These packages contain text descriptions, images, layouts, APIs etc. that serve as prompts for an on-device generative content generator (CG). The CG uses techniques like text-to-image, image-to-video and narrative generation to compose media experiences personalized for each user. 

The paper suggests standardized structures for prompt packages to ensure broad compatibility across devices. It also proposes multi-prompt operations where a user device combines prompts from different providers, both synchronously and asynchronously, leading to dynamic content assembly. Location-based prompts and user customization modules further enhance personalization.

Main Contributions:

- Concept of PDM systems for next-generation broadcasting using on-device generative AI
- Comprehensive system design spanning single- and multi-source operations, prompt packaging, receiver workflows etc.  
- Vision for super-personalized and dynamic media experiences via combinatory prompt mechanics
- Discussions around optimization of prompt structure, context coherence, efficiency, standardization etc.
- Use cases benefiting fatigue-resistance, efficiency, precise ad targeting etc.
- Overall framework to transform broadcasting using semantics and on-device creativity

In summary, the paper explores a generative AI-powered media ecosystem that promises personalized and dynamic experiences while enhancing delivery efficiency. The concept aligns broadcasting evolution with contemporary AI advancements towards more creative and adaptive networks.
