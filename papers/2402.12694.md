# [Revitalizing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learnable   Decomposition with Inter-Series Dependencies and Intra-Series Variations   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting multivariate time series is critical but challenging due to the need to precisely model intricate patterns such as inter-series dependencies (relationships among distinct variables) and intra-series variations (fluctuations within each time series).
- Existing methods struggle to handle non-linear structures and complex trends in real-world multivariate time series data. Specifically, they rely on basic moving average kernels for trend decomposition which lack robustness.

Proposed Solution: 
- A learnable decomposition strategy using a trainable 1D convolutional kernel initialized with a Gaussian distribution to better capture dynamic trend information.
- A dual attention module with two components: 1) Channel-wise self-attention to model inter-series dependencies by treating the entire time series of each variable as a token; 2) Auto-regressive self-attention to model intra-series variations by generating tokens that dynamically simulate temporal variations.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of a superior learnable convolutional decomposition method for time series that adapts to data and prioritizes recent points.
- Novel dual attention module that concurrently models both inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations while avoiding information loss.
- State-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmark datasets. Proposed decomposition strategy boosts performance of other models by 11.87% to 48.56% when incorporated.

In summary, the paper proposes a learnable decomposition strategy and dual attention module to effectively model intricate multivariate time series patterns. This revitalizes multivariate forecasting, achieving new state-of-the-art results and demonstrating strong generalizability.
