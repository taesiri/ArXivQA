# [Passive iFIR filters for data-driven control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- PID controllers are widely used due to simplicity, intuitive tuning, and inherent stability with passive plants. However, they have limitations in meeting complex performance requirements specified by desired input/output behaviors or transfer functions. 
- The authors propose a more flexible controller called "iFIR" that retains PID features like integral action and passivity.

Proposed Solution:
- The iFIR controller combines an integrator with a finite impulse response (FIR) filter in parallel. This replaces the simpler P and D actions of a PID with a more expressive FIR filter, while retaining integral action.
- A model-free, data-driven design approach is proposed based on virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT). This frames the controller design as a least-squares fitting problem.
- Passivity constraints are added to the optimization problem to guarantee stability with passive plants. Three passivity constraint formulations are given based on: 1) Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma 2) Constraining a Toeplitz matrix associated with the FIR filter 3) Constraining the sampled frequency response.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of iFIR controller that combines integrator and FIR filter to get a "better PID"
- Model-free data-driven design procedure for iFIRs using VRFT with passivity constraints 
- Three computationally tractable ways to enforce passivity constraints, with analysis of complexity
- With passive plants, stability is structurally guaranteed from passivity, separating stability and performance
- Demonstrated effectiveness of designing passive iFIRs and using them to meet complex performance requirements, outperforming PID
