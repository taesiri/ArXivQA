# [On the Planning Abilities of Large Language Models -- A Critical   Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15771)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

What are the planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) when evaluated in an autonomous mode and as a source of heuristic guidance for external planners?

The authors investigate two main hypotheses:

1. How effective are LLMs at generating plans autonomously for simple commonsense planning tasks? 

2. How useful are LLM-generated plans as a heuristic to guide search and planning for external AI planners?

The paper aims to systematically evaluate these two hypotheses by testing LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 on planning tasks adapted from International Planning Competition domains. The key research contribution seems to be a rigorous assessment of the planning abilities of LLMs under different settings - as standalone planners and as advisors to other planning systems. The authors find that while LLMs struggle to produce valid plans autonomously, their outputs can help improve search and planning when combined with a sound AI planner.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How effective are large language models (LLMs) at generating plans and providing heuristic guidance for planning tasks?

More specifically, the paper investigates:

1. How well LLMs can autonomously generate plans for simple commonsense planning problems. 

2. Whether LLM-generated plans, even if flawed, can provide useful heuristic guidance to improve planning for traditional AI planners.

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- LLMs will struggle to generate complete, valid plans on their own for planning problems due to limitations in combinatorial search.

- However, the plans produced by LLMs may still provide helpful heuristic guidance to AI planners by steering the search process in promising directions.

So in summary, the central research question seems to revolve around evaluating both the independent planning abilities of LLMs as well as their potential to offer useful, if imperfect, heuristics to aid external AI planners. The overarching goal is assessing the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs for contributing to planning and decision-making tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper appears to be presenting a systematic investigation and critical analysis of the planning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key aspects include:

- Evaluating LLMs in two distinct modes - autonomous and heuristic - for commonsense planning tasks. 

- In the autonomous mode, the paper shows that LLMs' ability to generate executable plans is limited, with the best model GPT-4 having only 12% success rate on average.

- In the heuristic mode, the paper demonstrates LLMs can provide useful guidance to improve search process of underlying sound planners. LLM-generated plans help reduce search steps compared to empty or random seed plans. 

- The paper also shows an external verifier can provide feedback on LLM plans to prompt LLMs to generate better plans via repeated interaction. This improves plan correctness in commonsense domains.

- Overall, the findings indicate LLMs perform poorly on planning tasks autonomously but can assist sound planners by providing heuristic guidance. The paper provides one of the first systematic benchmarks of LLMs for planning abilities.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous investigation and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for automated planning across different settings. The paper establishes empirical results on the limitations of LLMs for sound planning but also their potential usefulness in providing heuristics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main contribution is developing a critical investigation and benchmark for evaluating the planning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the authors:

- Evaluate LLMs on their ability to autonomously generate plans for simple commonsense planning tasks. They find the performance is quite poor, with only around 12% of plans generated by the best LLM (GPT-4) being valid and executable.

- Demonstrate LLMs can be useful in a "heuristic" mode by providing guidance or seed plans to sound AI planners. The LLM-generated plans help improve the search process and reduce planning steps required by the planner.

- Show an external plan verifier can provide feedback on flaws in LLM plans, and this can be used to backprompt the LLM to generate better plans in an iterative fashion.

Overall, the key contribution appears to be a rigorous benchmark and methodology for assessing the planning capabilities of LLMs. The results show limitations in autonomous planning, but potential value as heuristics or idea generators when combined with sound planning systems and verifiers. The paper provides an important empirical grounding to discussions around the reasoning abilities of large language models.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust evaluation methodologies to assess reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The authors point out limitations of current approaches including susceptibility to the Clever Hans effect and benefit of the doubt given for plausibly executable but incorrect plans. They suggest more rigorous automated evaluations leveraging AI planning tools.

- Exploring how LLMs can be combined with symbolic AI methods like automated planning to benefit from complementary strengths. The paper showed LLMs can provide useful heuristic guidance to planners through iteratively generated plan sketches. More work can be done on human-LLM collaboration as well. 

- Training and evaluating LLMs on more complex planning tasks and domains beyond the simple classical planning problems studied in the paper. The authors suggest investigating temporal and numeric planning domains.

- Studying whether LLMs can learn planning domain models and action schemas through natural language interaction alone, without providing the models upfront. This could reveal the limits of latent knowledge in LLMs.

- Understanding exactly which factors allow LLMs to show initial planning abilities like providing useful heuristics. Analyzing model architecture, scale, training data, prompting techniques etc. can provide insights.

- Investigating whether capabilities like planning emerge with few-shot prompting or if LLMs need to be explicitly trained for such reasoning tasks. The relative importance of pretraining versus fine-tuning is an open question.

- Examining social impacts of deploying LLMs for planning applications and mitigating potential risks related to bias, safety, misinformation etc.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust evaluation frameworks and benchmarks to assess reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors highlight the need for less anecdotal and more systematic evaluations of reasoning skills.

- Exploring different prompting techniques like providing structured knowledge graphs as input to guide the LLMs. The paper discusses the limitations of current prompting methods. 

- Leveraging LLMs as assistants to existing reasoning systems by using them as sources of commonsense knowledge and heuristics. The authors demonstrate this approach for planning tasks.

- Combining the strengths of LLMs and more traditional AI systems that are based on search and logical inferences. The paper argues LLMs and classical AI systems have complementary strengths.

- Training LLMs with a focus on acquiring causal, logical and abstract reasoning skills rather than just pattern recognition on statistical regularities. The authors suggest current training focuses more on the latter.

- Investigating social aspects like ethical reasoning and social cognition that require commonsense reasoning and planning. The authors note current work has focused more on individual reasoning skills.

In summary, the main directions are: better evaluation methods, improved prompting techniques, using LLMs to assist other reasoners, combining LLMs and classical AI, causal reasoning-focused training, and exploring social reasoning abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, it seems this paper is addressing two main questions: 

1. What planning abilities, if any, do large language models (LLMs) have when trained on general web corpora? Specifically, the authors seem interested in evaluating LLMs' effectiveness at generating plans autonomously for commonsense planning tasks, as well as their potential as a source of heuristic guidance for other planning agents.

2. How do LLMs perform on planning tasks in two different modes - autonomous, where the LLM generates plans alone, and heuristic, where the LLM plans are provided as guidance to an automated planner?

The authors note that LLMs may be good at generating plausible plans due to their broad knowledge from training on web data, but may struggle with ensuring plan correctness due to a lack of combinatorial search capabilities. 

To investigate these questions, the authors test LLMs on planning tasks based on International Planning Competition domains, in both autonomous and heuristic modes. The autonomous mode directly tests the plan generation abilities of LLMs alone, while the heuristic mode evaluates whether LLM-generated plans can help guide the search process of an automated planner towards valid solutions.

So in summary, the main focus is on rigorously testing and analyzing the planning capabilities of LLMs, in terms of both autonomous plan generation and providing useful heuristic guidance. The authors aim to go beyond anecdotal evidence and subjective evaluations that have characterized much of the prior work probing the reasoning abilities of large language models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4. The authors evaluate LLMs in two modes - autonomous, where the LLM generates plans by itself, and heuristic, where the LLM provides plan suggestions to an external AI planner or human. In autonomous mode, LLMs perform poorly, only able to generate correct plans for around 12% of simple planning problems on average. However, in heuristic mode, the authors show LLMs can provide useful guidance. LLM-generated plans help improve the search process and reduce steps taken by an AI planner called LPG. The authors also demonstrate that an external plan verifier called VAL can identify flaws in LLM plans, and this feedback can be used to back-prompt the LLM to generate better plans. Overall, the findings reveal LLMs have very limited ability to autonomously generate executable plans, but their plan suggestions can help guide external sound planners and verifiers. The results highlight the complementary strengths of LLMs as broad idea generators and formal AI planners that ensure plan correctness.
