# [Can Pretext-Based Self-Supervised Learning Be Boosted by Downstream   Data? A Theoretical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03568)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can pretext-based self-supervised learning be boosted by using some downstream data to refine the unlabeled data, so as to make the conditional independence condition hold?The key points are:- Pretext-based self-supervised learning learns representations via pretext tasks on unlabeled data. The learned representations can then be used for downstream prediction tasks.- Prior work showed that under a conditional independence (CI) condition between the pretext task variables and downstream labels given the input data, self-supervised learning achieves minimal sample complexity on downstream tasks. - However, the CI condition often does not hold in practice. - This paper explores whether using some labeled downstream data to refine the unlabeled data, via a learned data processor, can make the CI condition hold. The goal is to boost self-supervised learning.- The key question is whether this processor-based approach with limited downstream data can satisfy the necessary conditions (removing redundancy while retaining useful information) to actually improve downstream performance.So in summary, the main research question is whether using limited downstream data to refine unlabeled data can boost pretext-based self-supervised learning, by making the conditional independence condition hold. The paper provides theoretical analysis on the conditions under which this processor-based approach may fail or succeed.
