# [Can Pretext-Based Self-Supervised Learning Be Boosted by Downstream   Data? A Theoretical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03568)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can pretext-based self-supervised learning be boosted by using some downstream data to refine the unlabeled data, so as to make the conditional independence condition hold?The key points are:- Pretext-based self-supervised learning learns representations via pretext tasks on unlabeled data. The learned representations can then be used for downstream prediction tasks.- Prior work showed that under a conditional independence (CI) condition between the pretext task variables and downstream labels given the input data, self-supervised learning achieves minimal sample complexity on downstream tasks. - However, the CI condition often does not hold in practice. - This paper explores whether using some labeled downstream data to refine the unlabeled data, via a learned data processor, can make the CI condition hold. The goal is to boost self-supervised learning.- The key question is whether this processor-based approach with limited downstream data can satisfy the necessary conditions (removing redundancy while retaining useful information) to actually improve downstream performance.So in summary, the main research question is whether using limited downstream data to refine unlabeled data can boost pretext-based self-supervised learning, by making the conditional independence condition hold. The paper provides theoretical analysis on the conditions under which this processor-based approach may fail or succeed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:- Proposes a new self-supervised learning framework called Processor-based SSL (PSSL). In PSSL, a learnable data processor is introduced before the standard SSL pipeline to refine the unlabeled data. The goal is to make the conditional independence assumption approximately hold, so as to improve downstream performance. - Provides theoretical analysis on the sample complexity of training the data processor. Both model-free and model-dependent lower bounds are derived, showing that insufficient downstream samples can provably fail PSSL. The bounds suggest that the number of downstream samples needs to match the model capacity.- Conducts experiments on synthetic and real datasets to verify the theoretical results. The experiments confirm that PSSL fails when there are insufficient downstream samples for training the data processor, or when the model capacity is too large. The results validate that standard SSL is reasonable in not using any downstream data.In summary, this paper proposes a new way to potentially boost SSL by training a data processor with downstream data. But through rigorous theory and experiments, it shows that this actually hurts performance with insufficient downstream data, providing insights on when and how SSL could be improved. The novelty lies in the new PSSL framework and its counter-intuitive theoretical characterization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper theoretically analyzes whether using a small amount of downstream data to refine the unlabeled data can boost the performance of pretext-based self-supervised learning, and shows that insufficient downstream data can actually hurt performance instead of helping.
