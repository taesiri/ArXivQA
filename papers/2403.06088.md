## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores both Vision Transformer (ViT) and Residual Network (ResNet) models as foundations for the multi-task learning architecture. What are some key differences between these models in terms of their capabilities and limitations for this specific application? How do design considerations like computational complexity, feature learning, and spatial hierarchies factor into the choice between them?

2. The paper employs multiple adaptation techniques like linear probing, prefix tuning, and full fine-tuning when transferring knowledge from the pre-trained models. What are the trade-offs between these methods in terms of computational efficiency, risk of overfitting, and performance on in-distribution vs out-of-distribution data? When would one choose one over the other?

3. Curriculum learning is proposed as a training technique to potentially improve efficiency. How exactly does a curriculum learning strategy differ from traditional multi-task learning? What kinds of task sequencing heuristics could be used to organize simpler to more complex tasks? 

4. The preprocessing pipeline has multiple configurable parts like face extraction, normalization techniques, resizing etc. How do choices at each preprocessing stage impact what the model can learn and how well it might generalize? What would be some optimal preprocessing pipelines?

5. The paper analyzes differences between the synthetic datasets themselves in terms of diversity, noise, and variability. What precise characteristics differentiate the overly synthetic SynthA dataset from the more realistic SynthC? How do we programmatically generate synthetic data that better mimics real-world distributions?

6. Evaluation is performed using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. What additional quantitative and qualitative outcome measures could be used to assess model generalization capability? How could adversarial test cases be constructed to really stress test model performance?

7. The data distribution analysis provides insights into model limitations. Beyond inductive biases in the model architecture itself, what specifically in the training data distributions might the model be exploiting? Should models intentionally be trained to minimize reliance on such artifacts that may not hold out-of-distribution?

8. The multi-task objective combines gaze, age and facial expression recognition. In modular architectures like these, how should task relationships, constraints, priorities etc. factor into constructing the joint objective function? What risks are there in multi-objective training?

9. From an application perspective, how would a vision system like this integrate into an actual vehicle? What supporting instrumentation, calibration, and interfaces would be necessary for real-time driver monitoring and response? 

10. The work is still limited by synthetic dataset sample size and coverage. What roadmap could rapidly advance the feasibility of deploying trained multi-task perception models like these in production vehicles? What data efficiencies could transform the state of the art?
