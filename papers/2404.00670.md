# [Statistical Analysis by Semiparametric Additive Regression and LSTM-FCN   Based Hierarchical Classification for Computer Vision Quantification of   Parkinsonian Bradykinesia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00670)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Quantifying bradykinesia (slowness of movement) is vital for diagnosing and assessing severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
- Existing computer vision approaches for this do not adequately capture key aspects like "occasional arrest" and "decrement in amplitude".

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new features to represent decrement in amplitude (fatigue) and occasional arrests.
- Use LSTM-FCN model to classify motion and quantify arrests precisely.
- Employ statistical analysis using semiparametric additive model to test significance of created arrest/fatigue features.  
- Structure classification hierarchically, with LSTM-FCN for arrest and XGBoost classifier for final bradykinesia score.

Data:
- 1396 motion videos from 310 PD patients performing finger tapping, hand movement and rapid alternating movements.

Results: 
- Arrest and fatigue features found statistically significant in most cases, showing importance.
- Overall accuracy of 80.3% achieved across dataset.
- Ablation study confirms value of proposed arrest/fatigue features.
- No statistically significant difference between model predictions and expert scores.

Main Contributions:
- Precise quantification of key aspects of bradykinesia - occasional arrests and decrement in amplitude. 
- Demonstrated importance of considering these through statistical significance testing.
- Showcased effectiveness of proposed hierarchical classification structure using LSTM-FCN and XGBoost.
- Comprehensive validation on large real-world dataset from 310 PD patients.

In summary, the paper presents an enhanced computer vision approach for quantifying bradykinesia by focusing on its key characteristics. The robust and reliable methodology is validated thoroughly, advancing vision-based assessment of this condition.
