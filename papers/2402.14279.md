# [Mitigating the Linguistic Gap with Phonemic Representations for Robust   Multilingual Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language technologies exhibit significant performance gaps between high-resource languages (e.g. English) and low-resource languages. This is partly due to differences in data availability, but also due to inherent linguistic gaps between languages.

- Approaches to improve multilingual language understanding often require multiple languages during training, rely on complex techniques, and still struggle with large performance gaps between languages.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use phonemic representations (International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA) as input to language models instead of subwords or characters. This helps bridge linguistic gaps between languages.

- Provide both empirical evidence (from experiments on 3 cross-lingual tasks) and theoretical analysis showing phonemic representations mitigate performance gaps by reducing linguistic gaps.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate advantage of phonemic representations for robust multilingual language modeling, especially for low-resource languages

- Validate effectiveness of phonemic representations by comparing performance gap and linguistic gap across languages with other representations

- Explain empirical results theoretically using domain generalization literature - treat linguistic gap caused by lexical/syntactic differences as a domain gap 

- Advocate IPA as a universal representation to bridge linguistic gaps without needing complicated cross-lingual training

In summary, the key idea is that phonemic representation helps reduce both linguistic gaps and, consequently, performance gaps between languages for multilingual models. This is supported empirically and theoretically.
