# [Poincaré ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14027)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper introduces a new deep learning architecture called "Poincaré ResNet" which operates entirely in hyperbolic space, in contrast to previous works that only used hyperbolic geometry in the final layers. The central hypothesis appears to be that learning visual representations directly in hyperbolic space rather than Euclidean space can confer advantages like capturing latent hierarchies, enabling more compact models, and better mimicking visual processing in the brain.

To test this, the authors reformulate the ResNet architecture to work in the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic geometry. The main challenges they identify and address are:

1) Existing hyperbolic network initializations lead to vanishing gradients, so they propose a new identity-based initialization that preserves norms. 

2) Batch normalization relies on expensive calculations in hyperbolic space, so they introduce a faster "Poincaré midpoint batch normalization".

3) Hyperbolic operations lead to large computation graphs, so they manually derive backwards propagation for core operations.

The experiments seem focused on evaluating whether their proposed Poincaré ResNet architecture can work effectively for image classification compared to Euclidean ResNet, and whether it demonstrates properties like out-of-distribution robustness, adversarial robustness, and learning complementary representations.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating ResNet to operate in hyperbolic instead of Euclidean space can enable more effective and robust visual representation learning. The core contributions are the modifications needed to make ResNet work in hyperbolic space and the empirical demonstrations of its properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is introducing an end-to-end residual network called Poincaré ResNet that operates entirely on the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. The authors propose solutions for training challenges with deep convolutional networks in hyperbolic space, including a norm-preserving initialization, faster midpoint batch normalization, and manual backward derivations to optimize computation graphs. Experiments show Poincaré ResNet is more robust for out-of-distribution detection, adversarial attacks, and learns complementary representations compared to Euclidean ResNet. Overall, this paper presents a framework for learning visual representations directly in hyperbolic space through an end-to-end hyperbolic convolutional network architecture. The core contribution appears to be enabling and evaluating hyperbolic residual networks for computer vision tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in hyperbolic neural networks and deep learning:

- This paper focuses specifically on building convolutional neural networks that operate entirely in hyperbolic space, starting from the basic image pixels. Most prior work on hyperbolic neural networks has focused on mapping the embeddings from a standard Euclidean CNN into hyperbolic space, rather than learning representations directly in hyperbolic space. So this explores more end-to-end hyperbolic learning.

- The paper proposes solutions to several challenges unique to training deeper convolutional networks in hyperbolic space, like preserving norms over layers, efficient batch normalization, and keeping computation graphs manageable. These technical contributions could help make hyperbolic CNNs more viable.

- Previous hyperbolic neural network papers have focused a lot on graph-based data or textual/symbolic data. This paper brings more attention to potential benefits of hyperbolic geometry for computer vision tasks like image classification.

- The experiments are still quite limited in scale compared to state-of-the-art vision models. The paper examines smaller ResNet architectures on CIFAR datasets for proof of concept. Future work would need to scale up hyperbolic CNNs and benchmark on larger image datasets.

- The paper provides initial promising results on properties like out-of-distribution detection, adversarial robustness and complementary representations compared to Euclidean networks. But further investigation is needed to conclusively demonstrate the advantages.

Overall, I would say this paper makes some valuable technical contributions towards enabling fully hyperbolic convolutional networks, and opens up interesting research directions. But substantial future work is still needed to demonstrate whether end-to-end hyperbolic learning can improve vision models at a larger scale and on more complex tasks. The ideas here seem promising as an initial step in that direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating other network architectures besides ResNet to be formulated in hyperbolic space, such as DenseNets, Transformers, etc. They suggest hyperbolic learning could be beneficial for a wide range of network architectures.

- Exploring unsupervised and self-supervised hyperbolic learning. The authors mention that hyperbolic geometry has shown promise for discovering latent hierarchies, so leveraging this for unsupervised learning is an interesting direction.

- Applying hyperbolic networks to other computer vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, video analysis, etc. The benefits of hyperbolic learning may transfer to other vision domains.

- Combining hyperbolic and Euclidean learning in an end-to-end manner within the same model, rather than just fusing their outputs. Jointly learning both types of representations could be more effective.

- Investigating hyperbolic learning for other data modalities like graphs, sequences, and 3D geometry. The hierarchical nature of hyperbolic space could lend itself well to non-image data.

- Developing more optimized implementations and approximations for operations like the exponential/logarithmic maps to scale up hyperbolic networks.

- Theoretically analyzing the generalization bounds and expressivity of hyperbolic neural networks compared to Euclidean networks.

So in summary, they highlight many promising research avenues to further develop hyperbolic deep learning and apply it to broader areas in machine learning and computer vision.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Poincaré ResNet, an end-to-end residual network that operates entirely in the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. The authors propose several innovations to enable training deep residual networks in hyperbolic space. First, they develop hyperbolic convolutions and batch normalization tailored for images. Second, they propose an identity-based initialization that prevents vanishing gradients. Third, they introduce a midpoint-based batch normalization that is faster than using Fréchet means. Finally, they manually derive gradients for core hyperbolic operations to reduce memory usage. 

Empirically, the authors demonstrate the benefits of Poincaré ResNet. The identity initialization is shown to be norm-preserving over layers. The midpoint batch normalization speeds up training by 20-25% with no loss in accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that Poincaré ResNet is more robust to out-of-distribution samples and adversarial attacks compared to Euclidean ResNet. Fusing hyperbolic and Euclidean ResNets improves performance while being more parameter efficient than bigger individual models, indicating the complementary nature of both feature spaces. Overall, this work presents important steps towards learning visual representations directly in hyperbolic space.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is how to learn visual representations directly in hyperbolic space, from pixels to labels, using deep residual networks. Specifically:

- The paper notes that hyperbolic embeddings have shown promise for various computer vision tasks, but currently hyperbolic learning is only used in the final layers of deep networks, with visual features still learned through Euclidean networks. 

- The goal is to investigate learning hyperbolic representations starting from the pixel level, using end-to-end residual networks operating entirely in the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic geometry.

- This requires formulating the core components of ResNet architectures - convolutions, batch normalization, residuals - for the Poincaré ball model.

- Several challenges arise such as vanishing gradients, inefficient hyperbolic batch normalization, and computation graph explosion. The paper addresses these via an identity-based initialization, midpoint batch normalization, and manual backward derivations.

- Experiments demonstrate the potential of learning visual features in hyperbolic space, with gains in robustness, complementarity to Euclidean features, and modeling of hierarchical representations.

In summary, the key problem is learning visual representations directly in hyperbolic space using deep residual networks, overcoming challenges in optimization, efficiency and stability along the way. This opens up the potential of hyperbolic geometry in computer vision beyond just the final classification layers.
