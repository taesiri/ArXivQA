# [Poincaré ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14027)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we build and train deep convolutional neural networks that operate entirely in hyperbolic space, starting from the pixel level inputs? 

The key hypothesis appears to be that formulating and optimizing convolutional networks like ResNet to work fully in hyperbolic space (the Poincaré ball model specifically) will allow capturing more complex visual hierarchies and lead to models that are more robust and complementary to standard Euclidean networks.

To address this, the paper introduces methods for initializing, batch normalizing, and propagating gradients through hyperbolic convolutional layers. It proposes a full "Poincaré ResNet" model and demonstrates its viability on image classification tasks like CIFAR-10/100. Experiments suggest the hyperbolic networks are more robust to out-of-distribution samples and adversarial attacks compared to Euclidean ResNets.

In summary, the central research question is how to build deep convolutional networks that operate fully in hyperbolic space rather than Euclidean space, with the hypothesis that this will enable learning more hierarchical visual representations with useful properties like robustness. The paper proposes methods to realize this goal and provides initial experiments demonstrating the potential of end-to-end hyperbolic visual learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it looks like the main contribution of this paper is introducing an end-to-end residual network called Poincaré ResNet that operates entirely on the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. The key aspects seem to be:

- Proposing Poincaré convolutions and residual blocks to build the Poincaré ResNet architecture.

- Introducing an identity-based initialization method to preserve norms over many layers in hyperbolic networks. 

- Developing a midpoint-based batch normalization for Poincaré space that is faster than using Fréchet means.

- Manually deriving gradients for core Poincaré operations to optimize computation graphs.

- Empirically showing that Poincaré ResNet is more robust for out-of-distribution detection, adversarial attacks, and learns complementary representations compared to Euclidean ResNet.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing a full residual network architecture that can operate directly on hyperbolic space starting from the pixel level, overcoming challenges like vanishing gradients and inefficient computation. This seems to enable learning hyperbolic visual representations that can capture hierarchical information and lead to improved robustness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract, this paper introduces a novel end-to-end residual network architecture that operates entirely in hyperbolic space, specifically the Poincaré ball model. The key contributions seem to be:

- Formulating Poincaré residual blocks, including convolutions, batch norm, and activations like ReLU.

- An initialization method that prevents vanishing gradients in deeper hyperbolic networks. 

- A faster approximation to batch normalization using Poincaré midpoints.

- Manual derivation of gradients for core hyperbolic operations to reduce memory usage.

This seems to advance research on deep learning in hyperbolic space in several ways:

- Most prior work has only used hyperbolic embeddings in the final layers of networks. This explores end-to-end hyperbolic learning from pixels to labels.

- It tackles key challenges like vanishing gradients and computational efficiency that are barriers to deeper hyperbolic networks.

- It demonstrates improved robustness on tasks like out-of-distribution detection and adversarial robustness compared to Euclidean networks.

- It shows hyperbolic ResNets learn complementary representations to Euclidean ResNets.

Overall, this seems like an important step towards unlocking the benefits of hyperbolic geometry for computer vision. The architectural innovations and experiments demonstrate the potential for learning hierarchical visual representations entirely in hyperbolic space.

Compared to other hyperbolic learning papers, this goes further in exploring full hyperbolic network architectures rather than just final embeddings. The optimizations like midpoint batch norm also seem novel. The robustness experiments provide new motivation for hyperbolic deep learning. This seems like a significant contribution advancing hyperbolic neural networks for computer vision.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating other ResNet architectures and hyperbolic counterparts, beyond the simple residual blocks explored here. The authors mention exploring hyperbolic dense blocks or hyperbolic bottleneck blocks.

- Extending hyperbolic convolutional networks beyond computer vision, to areas like graph neural networks or natural language processing. The geometric properties of hyperbolic space could be useful in these domains as well.

- Exploring other variants of batch normalization in hyperbolic space, beyond the midpoint approach proposed here. Other aggregation methods may provide further benefits.

- Evaluating hyperbolic networks on larger-scale vision tasks and datasets. The experiments here are limited to CIFAR, so scaling up could reveal new insights.

- Combining hyperbolic and Euclidean layers within the same model, to get the benefits of both geometries. The authors propose this fusion approach but only evaluate simple ensembling.

- Investigating whether hyperbolic networks can learn hierarchical visual representations, as they hypothesize. Analyzing learned representations could reveal interesting properties.

- Comparing hyperbolic networks to other robust or adversarially resistant models, to further evaluate their capabilities.

- Developing specialized hardware or libraries for efficient hyperbolic deep learning, to better handle the computational complexity.

In summary, the authors lay out an extensive research agenda to further explore hyperbolic neural networks for computer vision and other domains. Key directions include architecture extensions, model scaling, representation analysis, and performance optimizations.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an end-to-end residual network that operates entirely on the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic learning has shown great potential for visual understanding, but is currently only performed in the penultimate layer(s) of deep networks. This paper proposes Poincaré ResNet, a hyperbolic counterpart of the celebrated residual network, starting from Poincaré 2D convolutions up to Poincaré residual connections. The paper identifies three roadblocks for training convolutional networks entirely in hyperbolic space and proposes a solution for each: 1) Current hyperbolic network initializations collapse to the origin. The paper provides an identity-based initialization that preserves norms over many layers. 2) Residual networks rely on batch normalization, which comes with expensive Fréchet mean calculations in hyperbolic space. The paper introduces Poincaré midpoint batch normalization as a faster and equally effective alternative. 3) The computation graphs of deep learning libraries blow up due to the intermediate operations in Poincaré layers. The paper provides manual backward derivations of core hyperbolic operations to contain the graph size.

Empirically, the paper shows their network initialization is norm-preserving and improves generalization. The midpoint batch normalization speeds up training by 25% with no loss in accuracy. The paper demonstrates the potential of Poincaré ResNet for out-of-distribution detection, adversarial robustness, and learning complementary representations compared to Euclidean ResNet. Overall, this paper makes important contributions towards realizing fully hyperbolic visual learning and unlocking the benefits of hyperbolic geometry for computer vision.
