# [Poincaré ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14027)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper introduces a new deep learning architecture called "Poincaré ResNet" which operates entirely in hyperbolic space, in contrast to previous works that only used hyperbolic geometry in the final layers. The central hypothesis appears to be that learning visual representations directly in hyperbolic space rather than Euclidean space can confer advantages like capturing latent hierarchies, enabling more compact models, and better mimicking visual processing in the brain.

To test this, the authors reformulate the ResNet architecture to work in the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic geometry. The main challenges they identify and address are:

1) Existing hyperbolic network initializations lead to vanishing gradients, so they propose a new identity-based initialization that preserves norms. 

2) Batch normalization relies on expensive calculations in hyperbolic space, so they introduce a faster "Poincaré midpoint batch normalization".

3) Hyperbolic operations lead to large computation graphs, so they manually derive backwards propagation for core operations.

The experiments seem focused on evaluating whether their proposed Poincaré ResNet architecture can work effectively for image classification compared to Euclidean ResNet, and whether it demonstrates properties like out-of-distribution robustness, adversarial robustness, and learning complementary representations.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating ResNet to operate in hyperbolic instead of Euclidean space can enable more effective and robust visual representation learning. The core contributions are the modifications needed to make ResNet work in hyperbolic space and the empirical demonstrations of its properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is introducing an end-to-end residual network called Poincaré ResNet that operates entirely on the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. The authors propose solutions for training challenges with deep convolutional networks in hyperbolic space, including a norm-preserving initialization, faster midpoint batch normalization, and manual backward derivations to optimize computation graphs. Experiments show Poincaré ResNet is more robust for out-of-distribution detection, adversarial attacks, and learns complementary representations compared to Euclidean ResNet. Overall, this paper presents a framework for learning visual representations directly in hyperbolic space through an end-to-end hyperbolic convolutional network architecture. The core contribution appears to be enabling and evaluating hyperbolic residual networks for computer vision tasks.
