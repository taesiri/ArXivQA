# [Empowering Data Mesh with Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional centralized data architectures like data lakes face bottlenecks in managing large-scale, complex data from different domains in modern enterprises. This hinders timely data analysis and decision making. 

- A new decentralized architecture called Data Mesh is proposed to distribute data ownership across domains. However, traditional centralized machine learning approaches are not suitable for this.

Solution:
- The paper proposes using Federated Learning integrated with Data Mesh to enable decentralized and collaborative training of ML models across domains, without sharing raw data. 

- Specifically, Split Learning is determined to be well-aligned to Data Mesh principles as it allows each domain to train parts of an ML model locally using their own data, and only share intermediate representations.

Main Contributions:
- Identified key characteristics of ML models as data products within distributed Data Mesh architecture.

- Designed system architectures for Split Learning under Data Mesh for two scenarios - with and without label sharing between domains.

- Demonstrated applicability via two real-world use cases of recommendation system and fraud detection, showing performance on par with centralized models. 

- Showed Split Learning can leverage diversity of decentralized domains under Data Mesh to improve model accuracy as number of domains is increased.

In summary, the paper pioneers an integration of Federated Learning into Data Mesh paradigm to enable privacy-preserving, decentralized ML across domains while aligning with Data Mesh principles. The solutions show promising accuracy and underscore the prospects for this approach.
