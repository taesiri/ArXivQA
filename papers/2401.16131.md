# [CIMIL-CRC: a clinically-informed multiple instance learning framework   for patient-level colorectal cancer molecular subtypes classification from   H\&amp;E stained images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Treatment approaches for colorectal cancer (CRC) depend on molecular subtyping into microsatellite instability (MSI) or microsatellite stable (MSS). However, the current method of subtyping using DNA sequencing is costly and time-consuming.
- Using deep learning on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathology slide images can automate this subtyping in a more efficient way by analyzing visual features. But these whole slide images (WSIs) have an extremely large size that poses computational challenges. 
- Existing patch-based and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods have limitations in selecting the most representative patches, risking information loss, and overlooking clinically relevant data like tumor location trends.

Proposed Solution - CIMIL-CRC:
- A clinically-informed MIL framework to categorize H&E stained CRC WSIs into MSI/MSS molecular subtypes
- Involves 4 main steps:
   1) Extract visual features from all patches using a CNN 
   2) Apply PCA to create a lower-dimensional patient-level representation that retains information from all patches
   3) Patient-level classification using these representations via an attention-based MIL technique
   4) Incorporate clinical knowledge that MSI predominantly occurs in right-sided tumors to adjust classification

Main Contributions:
- Merging PCA with MIL for retaining full slide information during classification
- Improving accuracy by integrating tumor location clinical prior knowledge 
- Surpassing state-of-the-art methods applied to the TCGA-CRC-DX dataset, achieving an AUROC of 0.92 and AUPRC of 0.86
- Elucidating the distinct contributions in enhanced performance from the PCA-MIL approach and clinical data integration

The CIMIL-CRC methodology shows promise for automated, efficient and accurate molecular subtyping of CRC from standard histopathology slide images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CIMIL-CRC, a clinically-informed multiple instance learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance in classifying colorectal cancer histopathology images into microsatellite instability and microsatellite stable molecular subtypes by efficiently combining patch-level features using PCA and integrating tumor location clinical priors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. Proposing a novel patient-level classification method called "Clinically Informed Multiple Instance Learning for Colorectal Cancer (CIMIL-CRC)" that integrates a PCA-based multiple instance learning (MIL) approach with clinical side information to classify colorectal cancer (CRC) whole-slide images (WSIs) into microsatellite instability (MSI) and microsatellite stable (MSS) molecular subtypes. 

2. Showing that the proposed CIMIL-CRC framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TCGA-CRC-DX dataset, significantly outperforming previous patch-level and MIL-based methods in terms of AUCROC, AUPRC, F1 score, etc. Specifically, CIMIL-CRC attained an AUCROC of 0.92 and AUPRC of 0.86, which are the best results reported on this dataset.

3. Demonstrating the individual contributions of the PCA-based MIL approach and integration of clinical side information in enhancing model performance over baseline patch-level classification.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel CIMIL-CRC framework that effectively combines MIL and clinical priors to push state-of-the-art in molecular subtyping of CRC from histopathology.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel Clinically Informed Multiple Instance Learning framework for Colorectal Cancer (CIMIL-CRC). How does this framework differ from traditional MIL approaches for MSI/MSS classification in terms of the patch aggregation strategy?

2. The CIMIL-CRC model applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on patch-level features to generate a patient-level representation. What is the main motivation behind using PCA compared to other dimensionality reduction techniques? How does retaining the top eigenvectors encapsulate valuable information?

3. The paper demonstrates integrating clinical location information of the tumor into the CIMIL-CRC model. Why is this side prior highly relevant for MSI/MSS classification? How is the side function mathematically formulated to adjust the classifier output?

4. What are the key differences between the Baseline model, CI-CRC model, MIL-CRC model and CIMIL-CRC model evaluated in this study? What is the relative contribution of the MIL strategy and clinical prior towards overall performance enhancement?  

5. The experiments optimize two main hyper-parameters - the number of top eigenvectors and the label smoothing rate. How was the optimal configuration selected for these parameters based on the validation set analysis? What was the optimal setting?

6. What evaluation metrics were used to compare the performance of the CIMIL-CRC model against other approaches? What were the key results highlighting the superiority of CIMIL-CRC on the TCGA-CRC-DX test set?

7. How does the performance of CIMIL-CRC fare against recent state-of-the-art methods applied on the same TCGA-CRC-DX dataset? What differences exist between these methods in terms of techniques and datasets used?

8. The paper emphasizes retaining information from all patches via PCA instead of selecting representative patches. What are the limitations of selecting key patches? How does the proposed approach overcome this?

9. The CIMIL-CRC model uses a pre-trained feature extraction network. What architecture is used for this purpose and how are the resulting feature matrices processed via PCA? How does this strategy avoid end-to-end training?

10. What are some of the limitations of the CIMIL-CRC model proposed in the paper? What aspects can be further improved to enhance MSI/MSS classification performance?
