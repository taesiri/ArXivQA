# [Template Filling for Controllable Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00539)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the task of template commonsense reasoning (TemplateCSR), where commonsense reasoning is achieved by filling slots in templates rather than selecting from a fixed set of answers. This allows for more control and flexibility compared to existing commonsense reasoning tasks. 

2. Introducing a dataset of commonsense reasoning templates and corresponding expansions for the TemplateCSR task. The dataset contains around 3600 unique template-expansion pairs collected from diverse sources.

3. Presenting POTTER, a model that formulates TemplateCSR as a prompt-tuning task for pretrained language models. Given a template, POTTER generates an expanded sentence filling in the slots. The slots are specified via prompts that indicate the abstraction for that slot. 

4. Evaluating POTTER on the TemplateCSR dataset. Experiments show POTTER outperforms baselines on generation metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore as well as on factuality metrics like FACTCC.

5. Providing analysis on the types of errors made by POTTER, giving insights into the challenges of commonsense reasoning for language models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the TemplateCSR task and dataset to allow for more controllable commonsense reasoning, along with presenting POTTER as a strong baseline model for this new task. The analysis also surfaces challenges language models still face in reliably performing multi-hop commonsense reasoning.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we enable large language models to perform controlled and explainable commonsense reasoning through a template filling approach?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By formulating commonsense reasoning as a template filling task and training language models to complete reasoning templates, we can achieve more controllable and explainable commonsense reasoning compared to existing approaches.

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called "Template Commonsense Reasoning" (TemplateCSR) which involves creating reasoning templates with slots for concepts, qualifiers, and explanations. The authors hypothesize that by training language models to complete these templates in a prompt-based manner, the models can learn to perform multi-hop reasoning while allowing for more control over the reasoning process compared to selecting answers from a fixed set or knowledge base. 

To evaluate this, the authors create a new dataset of commonsense reasoning templates and expansions, introduce a model called POTTER that is trained to fill these templates, and demonstrate through experiments that their approach outperforms baselines in terms of generation quality and factuality.

In summary, the central research question is how to achieve more controllable and explainable commonsense reasoning through a template filling approach with language models. The key hypothesis is that their proposed TemplateCSR method will enable better reasoning capabilities than existing approaches. The experiments aim to validate whether their approach does indeed improve performance on this challenging reasoning task.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper relates to other research on commonsense reasoning:

- It focuses on a template-based approach to commonsense reasoning, in contrast to prior work that has used multiple choice setups or open-ended knowledge base approaches. The template-based method allows for more control over the reasoning process.

- The paper introduces a new dataset of commonsense reasoning template-expansion pairs. This adds to existing commonsense reasoning datasets, but with a different structure more suited to the template-based approach.

- The proposed POTTER model adapts pretrained language models like BART and T5 to do template filling. This is similar to other work using LMs for commonsense reasoning, but tailored for the template task. 

- The template approach focuses on controllable and explainable reasoning, allowing specification of concepts, relationships, and explanations. This differs from some other LM commonsense reasoning work that is more open-ended.

- Evaluation includes both generation metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, as well as factual correctness metrics like FACTCC. Using both types provides a more robust assessment.

- There is an analysis of the types of errors the model makes, shedding light on challenges like producing generic explanations vs incorrect facts. This provides additional insight beyond just model performance metrics.

Overall, this paper introduces a new template-based angle on commonsense reasoning that complements existing approaches. The dataset, model, and evaluation help advance research on controlling the reasoning process and overcoming issues like factual correctness in LM models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the template-based commonsense reasoning approach to other controllable generation tasks like story generation and summarization. The authors mention this as an avenue for future work.

- Incorporating retrieval systems to identify relevant textual evidence that can support or refute the generated text. This could help improve factual consistency.

- Developing more advanced prompt design strategies to provide better control over the reasoning process. The current prompting approach is relatively simple.

- Exploring different training objectives beyond maximum likelihood to improve factual correctness, which remains a key challenge.

- Creating larger and more diverse datasets for training and evaluation. The current dataset is limited in size and domain.

- Conducting human evaluations to complement automated metrics, especially for assessing factual correctness. 

- Performing more in-depth error analyses to further understand where models fail and how to improve them. The authors provide some initial analysis.

- Investigating how to make models explain their reasoning in more detail, building on the optional explanation slot. Explainability is important.

- Studying how to integrate retrieval and external knowledge more tightly into the reasoning process rather than just using it for evaluation.

- Comparing the template-based approach to other commonsense reasoning methods to better understand the tradeoffs.

So in summary, the authors propose this as a novel way to perform more controllable reasoning using language models, but there are still many open challenges surrounding the template design, training process, evaluation, explainability, and integration with knowledge that could be interesting areas for future work.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a template-based approach called TemplateCSR for controllable commonsense reasoning using language models. The authors present a dataset of template-expansion pairs for commonsense reasoning related to lifestyle and health concepts. The templates contain open-ended slots for concepts as well as optional slots for qualifiers and explanations.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called Template Commonsense Reasoning (TemplateCSR) which involves filling templates with slots in order to perform controlled commonsense reasoning, as opposed to selecting answers from a list or knowledge base. This is challenging as there are no available annotations and potentially multiple valid expansions for each template. The authors present a dataset of commonsense reasoning template-expansion pairs collected from diverse sources, comprising around 3600 unique pairs. They also introduce POTTER, a pretrained sequence-to-sequence model that is prompted with templates containing slots for concepts in order to produce meaningful completed sentences. The concepts in each slot are indicated via a prompt describing the abstraction of that slot. Experiments demonstrate that POTTER outperforms baselines on commonsense reasoning using both generation metrics like ROUGE and BERTscore, as well as factuality metrics like FACTCC. Although factual errors persist, the approach provides more nuanced understanding of mistakes and expands the potential for building commonsense reasoning systems with PLMs.

In summary, this paper introduces a dataset and model for controlled, explainable multi-hop reasoning by training language models on a template-expansion task. Experiments show the approach outperforms baselines on generation and factuality metrics. While factual errors remain, the template-based method offers additional insight into commonsense reasoning with PLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a template-based approach to commonsense reasoning called Template Commonsense Reasoning (TemplateCSR). The key idea is to formulate commonsense reasoning questions as template-expansion pairs, where the template contains slots for concepts and constraints, and the expansion is a valid natural language completion of the template. The paper presents a dataset of around 3600 template-expansion pairs related to lifestyle and health concepts. They then propose POTTER, which casts TemplateCSR as a seq2seq task, taking as input a prompt-filled template and generating the corresponding expanded text. POTTER is trained on the collected dataset using standard pretrain-finetune of BART and T5 models. During inference, prompts specify the abstraction for each concept slot, a multiple choice qualifier models the relationship, and an explanation slot generates free-form text. Experiments show POTTER outperforms baselines in generation and factuality metrics. The approach aims to provide more control over commonsense reasoning compared to selecting from answer candidates or assuming the answer exists in a KB.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a model called Template Commonsense Reasoning (TemplateCSR), which aims to enhance the commonsense reasoning capabilities of NLP systems. The key ideas are:

1. Framing commonsense reasoning as a template filling task. This allows more control over the reasoning by specifying slots/constraints, compared to selecting from multiple choice options or assuming the answer exists in a KB.

2. Proposing a dataset of commonsense reasoning template-expansion pairs to enable training models for this task.

3. Presenting POTTER, a model that fills the reasoning templates using prompting and pretrained seq2seq models like BART. The prompts specify the abstraction of each slot.

4. Showing that POTTER outperforms baselines in generation metrics like ROUGE and factuality metrics like FACTCC.

5. Analyzing the errors made by POTTER to get more insight into the challenges of commonsense reasoning for language models.

In summary, the paper aims to move towards more controllable and explainable commonsense reasoning by formulating it as a template filling task and training language models for this using prompting. The dataset and model allow better understanding of reasoning mistakes compared to existing approaches.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called TemplateCSR for controllable commonsense reasoning using language models. The key idea is to formulate commonsense reasoning as a template filling task, where the model is given a reasoning template with slots and asked to generate an appropriate expansion. To enable this, the authors first contribute a new dataset of commonsense reasoning templates and corresponding expansions related to health and lifestyle.
