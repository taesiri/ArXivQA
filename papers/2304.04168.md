# [Adversarially Robust Neural Architecture Search for Graph Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04168)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop a graph neural network architecture that is robust to adversarial attacks?

Specifically, the authors aim to design a neural architecture search framework to automatically find graph neural network architectures that are resilient against adversarial attacks on graph data. They hypothesize that by incorporating defensive operations into the search space and optimizing a robustness metric during architecture search, they can obtain GNN models that are significantly more robust compared to prior manually designed or automatically searched architectures.

In summary, the key research question is how to leverage neural architecture search to obtain graph neural networks that are adversarially robust, through designing a suitable robust search space and optimization procedure. The central hypothesis is that this approach will lead to greater robustness compared to prior GNN architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing the first robust neural architecture search framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) called G-RNA. This allows understanding and enhancing the robustness of GNNs from an architectural perspective. 

2. Designing a novel and expressive search space with graph structure mask operations that incorporates important robust operations on graphs as candidates. This allows automatically selecting appropriate defense strategies when confronting perturbed graphs.

3. Defining a robustness metric to guide the search process and help filter robust architectures. 

4. Adopting an evolutionary algorithm together with a single-path one-shot NAS framework to search for optimal robust GNN architectures.

5. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that G-RNA outperforms state-of-the-art robust GNNs significantly by 12.1% to 23.4% on benchmark datasets under heavy adversarial attacks.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing the first robust neural architecture search framework for GNNs that can effectively search for optimal and robust GNN architectures automatically. The novel search space design, robustness metric, and search algorithm are the core components that enable this capability.
