# [Adversarially Robust Neural Architecture Search for Graph Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04168)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop a graph neural network architecture that is robust to adversarial attacks?

Specifically, the authors aim to design a neural architecture search framework to automatically find graph neural network architectures that are resilient against adversarial attacks on graph data. They hypothesize that by incorporating defensive operations into the search space and optimizing a robustness metric during architecture search, they can obtain GNN models that are significantly more robust compared to prior manually designed or automatically searched architectures.

In summary, the key research question is how to leverage neural architecture search to obtain graph neural networks that are adversarially robust, through designing a suitable robust search space and optimization procedure. The central hypothesis is that this approach will lead to greater robustness compared to prior GNN architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing the first robust neural architecture search framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) called G-RNA. This allows understanding and enhancing the robustness of GNNs from an architectural perspective. 

2. Designing a novel and expressive search space with graph structure mask operations that incorporates important robust operations on graphs as candidates. This allows automatically selecting appropriate defense strategies when confronting perturbed graphs.

3. Defining a robustness metric to guide the search process and help filter robust architectures. 

4. Adopting an evolutionary algorithm together with a single-path one-shot NAS framework to search for optimal robust GNN architectures.

5. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that G-RNA outperforms state-of-the-art robust GNNs significantly by 12.1% to 23.4% on benchmark datasets under heavy adversarial attacks.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing the first robust neural architecture search framework for GNNs that can effectively search for optimal and robust GNN architectures automatically. The novel search space design, robustness metric, and search algorithm are the core components that enable this capability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel robust neural architecture search framework for graph neural networks called G-RNA, which designs a robust search space with graph structure mask operations to automatically search for optimal adversarial robust graph neural network architectures.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of adversarial robustness for graph neural networks:

- This paper proposes a novel framework (G-RNA) that uses neural architecture search to find optimal robust graph neural network architectures. Most prior work has focused on manually designing robust GNNs or robust training procedures. Using NAS to discover robust architectures is a relatively new idea for GNNs. 

- The key innovation is designing a robust search space with various graph structure mask operations, and using a robustness metric to guide the search. This allows G-RNA to automatically find the best defense strategies for a given graph/task. Other NAS methods don't consider robustness or use simplified search spaces.

- Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of G-RNA, outperforming prior robust GNN methods by significant margins. The analysis also provides insights into how architectural choices impact robustness. Most prior work evaluated on 1 or 2 datasets so the comprehensive evaluation is a notable strength.

- The approach is model-agnostic and does not rely on specific threat models. This provides greater adaptability to new attacks compared to methods like GCN-SVD or GCN-Jaccard that make assumptions about the adversary.

- Limitations include computational efficiency and lack of theoretical robustness guarantees. The focus is empirical robustness. Some recent works have looked at certified robustness for GNNs.

In summary, the key novelty is using NAS to automate robust GNN design, enabled by a robust search space and evaluation metric. The comprehensive empirical analysis and superior performance make this a significant advance over prior manually designed defenses and standard NAS approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method for feature-based attacks. The current work focuses on structural attacks, but the authors suggest extending the robustness metric and approach to handle adversarial attacks on node features as well.

- Improving computational efficiency. The authors acknowledge that their method lacks efficiency compared to some other NAS approaches. They suggest improving efficiency as an area for future work.

- Incorporating additional graph structure mask operations. The authors designed a robust search space using representative graph structure mask operations for defense. They suggest integrating more operations like graph structure learning could be interesting future work. 

- Applying the method to additional complex graph data. The current experiments are on standard citation networks and a co-purchase network. The authors suggest applying the robust NAS method to more complex graph data like heterogeneous graphs or temporal graphs.

- Combining with graph certification methods. The authors mention that combining the approach with methods that certify robustness under perturbation budgets could be an interesting direction.

- Extending the framework with different search algorithms. The current work uses an evolutionary algorithm for search. Exploring different search algorithms in the robust NAS framework for graphs could be future work.

In summary, the main future directions are improving efficiency, broadening the approach to handle different data and attacks, combining with other methods like certification, and exploring extensions of the search framework itself. The authors lay out a research agenda for further developing robust neural architecture search for graph neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel robust neural architecture search framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) called G-RNA. GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which limits their use in risk-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods rely on manual designs and prior knowledge of attacks, and neglect the role of architectures. G-RNA is the first work to use neural architecture search to enhance GNN robustness. It designs a robust search space with graph structure mask operations that can recover existing defenses. A robustness metric is proposed to guide the evolutionary search for optimal architectures. Experiments show G-RNA significantly outperforms manual robust GNNs and vanilla NAS methods against attacks by 12.1-23.4%. G-RNA provides architectural insights into GNN robustness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel robust neural architecture search framework for graph neural networks called G-RNA. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been very successful in modeling relational data but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing defensive methods rely on manual designs and prior knowledge of attacks, making them unable to adapt to new data, tasks, or attacks. G-RNA is the first work to leverage neural architecture search to enhance GNN robustness. 

Specifically, G-RNA designs a robust search space with graph structure mask operations that can recover existing defense methods. It trains a supernet in a one-shot way over this search space. Then it defines a robustness metric to measure architecture robustness on clean and adversarially perturbed graphs. Using this metric, G-RNA searches for optimal robust architectures via an evolutionary algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show G-RNA significantly outperforms existing robust GNNs and vanilla NAS methods under attacks by large margins. G-RNA provides a new perspective on understanding and improving GNN robustness through neural architecture search.
