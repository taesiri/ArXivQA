# [Adversarially Robust Neural Architecture Search for Graph Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04168)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop a graph neural network architecture that is robust to adversarial attacks?

Specifically, the authors aim to design a neural architecture search framework to automatically find graph neural network architectures that are resilient against adversarial attacks on graph data. They hypothesize that by incorporating defensive operations into the search space and optimizing a robustness metric during architecture search, they can obtain GNN models that are significantly more robust compared to prior manually designed or automatically searched architectures.

In summary, the key research question is how to leverage neural architecture search to obtain graph neural networks that are adversarially robust, through designing a suitable robust search space and optimization procedure. The central hypothesis is that this approach will lead to greater robustness compared to prior GNN architectures.
