# [One Copy Is All You Need: Resource-Efficient Streaming of Medical   Imaging Data at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00438)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can progressive resolution encoding and streaming of medical images reduce infrastructure inefficiencies and computational requirements for hosting and distributing large medical imaging datasets, while maintaining image quality and utility for downstream tasks like deep learning?The key ideas and hypotheses appear to be:- Large medical imaging datasets lead to inefficient use of bandwidth, storage, and compute for users working with these datasets, as they must download full resolution images even if lower resolutions are sufficient. - Progressive resolution encoding, where images can be reconstructed at multiple resolutions from a single encoded file, could help address these inefficiencies. - However, current progressive resolution codecs have limitations for medical imaging, and software to operationalize progressive streaming of medical images is lacking.- The authors hypothesize that their proposed framework, MIST, can dramatically reduce imaging infrastructure costs by progressive encoding and streaming, while maintaining image quality and utility for deep learning tasks.- They test this by encoding 3 sample datasets with MIST, showing large reductions in required storage and bandwidth. - They also demonstrate deep learning models trained on images streamed with MIST perform similarly to models trained on conventionally downsampled images.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that progressive streaming with MIST can reduce medical imaging infrastructure inefficiencies, and they provide results supporting this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The proposal and development of MIST (Medical Image Streaming Toolkit), an open-source framework to enable progressive encoding, streaming, and decoding of medical images. This allows storing images at a single high resolution while being able to transmit and reconstruct them at multiple lower resolutions.2. Demonstrating that MIST can dramatically reduce storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and transmitting large medical imaging datasets. Experiments showed 90%+ reductions in storage and bandwidth while maintaining image quality.3. Showing that images streamed via MIST can be used to train deep learning models with similar performance to models trained on conventionally downsampled images. This verifies that MIST maintains the information needed for AI applications.4. Providing an implementation of MIST that supports various medical image formats (DICOM, NIfTI, etc) and modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray). The code is open-source to enable adoption.5. Discussing how MIST could overhaul medical imaging data infrastructure to reduce waste, make datasets more accessible, and lower the carbon footprint of working with large datasets.In summary, the key innovation is the design and demonstration of the MIST framework to enable efficient progressive streaming of medical images while maintaining image quality and information content. This has the potential to significantly improve how large imaging datasets are stored, transmitted, and used.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from this paper:The proposed MIST framework enables efficient storage and streaming of medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy, dramatically reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining image quality for downstream deep learning applications.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:This paper presents an open-source framework called MIST (Medical Image Streaming Toolkit) for streaming medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy. The key innovation is the use of progressive resolution encoding, specifically the HTJ2K codec, to enable storing images at one resolution while delivering them at different requested resolutions. This approach is novel in the context of medical image streaming. Prior work has used progressive encoding like JPEG2000 for niche web viewing applications, but not for operationalizing multi-resolution streaming from a single copy. The Amazon HealthLake toolkit does use HTJ2K but only for raw DICOM images, whereas MIST supports various formats like NifTI and PNG. Also, existing tools don't have the capability to splice and stream partial byte streams that is core to MIST's efficiency.The impact is a dramatic reduction in storage and bandwidth needs for hosting and accessing medical image databases like TCIA. The authors demonstrate high compression ratios and substantial bandwidth savings in streaming three different datasets, with rigorous evaluation of lossless and lossy reconstruction quality. Downstream tasks like deep learning classification and segmentation on progressive images vs downsampled images show no significant performance differences.Compared to other medical image compression methods like JPEG and JPEG2000, MIST provides novel capabilities for streaming multi-resolution data on demand. The imaging community has been enthusiastic about integrating HTJ2K in standards like DICOMWeb, and MIST operationalizes it in an open-source toolkit tailored for medical images. This can greatly improve accessibility and efficiencies in large-scale imaging datasets.The limitations compared to prior art are the loss of precision in encoding float images and overhead of handling 3D data. But the authors provide clear plans to address these limitations in future work. Overall, MIST seems like an important open-source contribution to enable multi-resolution streaming for medical images, advancing capabilities beyond prior progressive encoding tools.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential future research directions based on the work presented in this paper:- Conduct more extensive validation of the MIST framework, beyond just deep learning applications, to fully evaluate it for downstream analyses like radiomics and clinical use cases. They suggest in-depth diagnostic equivalence reader studies with radiologists to ensure it maintains diagnostic quality.- Address current limitations of MIST before deployment, such as the minor loss of image fidelity during encoding and limitations in handling 3D medical imaging data. They propose specific technical solutions like extending precision to 16-bit and better integration of the OpenJPH library.- Extend the MIST framework to support additional medical imaging formats and modalities beyond the ones demonstrated.- Evaluate the performance and efficiency of MIST at larger scales, with more datasets, users, and use cases. The authors propose a thorough analysis of the reduction in bandwidth, storage, and compute requirements.- Analyze the reduction in carbon footprint and environmental impact enabled by MIST's improved efficiency in transmitting and processing medical images.- Explore modifications to the progressive encoding process to further optimize encoding for medical images specifically, beyond using off-the-shelf codecs.- Investigate the use of variable/adaptive compression levels in the encoding process based on imaging characteristics to maximize compression without sacrificing diagnostic quality.- Develop enhanced user interfaces and experiences for requesting and visualizing progressive medical image streaming through MIST.In summary, the authors propose further technical development and validation of MIST, as well as analyses of its efficiency and environmental benefits at scale, and exploring specialized modifications and optimizations of progressive encoding tailored for medical images.
