# [One Copy Is All You Need: Resource-Efficient Streaming of Medical   Imaging Data at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00438)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can progressive resolution encoding and streaming of medical images reduce infrastructure inefficiencies and computational requirements for hosting and distributing large medical imaging datasets, while maintaining image quality and utility for downstream tasks like deep learning?

The key ideas and hypotheses appear to be:

- Large medical imaging datasets lead to inefficient use of bandwidth, storage, and compute for users working with these datasets, as they must download full resolution images even if lower resolutions are sufficient. 

- Progressive resolution encoding, where images can be reconstructed at multiple resolutions from a single encoded file, could help address these inefficiencies. 

- However, current progressive resolution codecs have limitations for medical imaging, and software to operationalize progressive streaming of medical images is lacking.

- The authors hypothesize that their proposed framework, MIST, can dramatically reduce imaging infrastructure costs by progressive encoding and streaming, while maintaining image quality and utility for deep learning tasks.

- They test this by encoding 3 sample datasets with MIST, showing large reductions in required storage and bandwidth. 

- They also demonstrate deep learning models trained on images streamed with MIST perform similarly to models trained on conventionally downsampled images.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that progressive streaming with MIST can reduce medical imaging infrastructure inefficiencies, and they provide results supporting this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The proposal and development of MIST (Medical Image Streaming Toolkit), an open-source framework to enable progressive encoding, streaming, and decoding of medical images. This allows storing images at a single high resolution while being able to transmit and reconstruct them at multiple lower resolutions.

2. Demonstrating that MIST can dramatically reduce storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and transmitting large medical imaging datasets. Experiments showed 90%+ reductions in storage and bandwidth while maintaining image quality.

3. Showing that images streamed via MIST can be used to train deep learning models with similar performance to models trained on conventionally downsampled images. This verifies that MIST maintains the information needed for AI applications.

4. Providing an implementation of MIST that supports various medical image formats (DICOM, NIfTI, etc) and modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray). The code is open-source to enable adoption.

5. Discussing how MIST could overhaul medical imaging data infrastructure to reduce waste, make datasets more accessible, and lower the carbon footprint of working with large datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is the design and demonstration of the MIST framework to enable efficient progressive streaming of medical images while maintaining image quality and information content. This has the potential to significantly improve how large imaging datasets are stored, transmitted, and used.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from this paper:

The proposed MIST framework enables efficient storage and streaming of medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy, dramatically reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining image quality for downstream deep learning applications.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

This paper presents an open-source framework called MIST (Medical Image Streaming Toolkit) for streaming medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy. The key innovation is the use of progressive resolution encoding, specifically the HTJ2K codec, to enable storing images at one resolution while delivering them at different requested resolutions. 

This approach is novel in the context of medical image streaming. Prior work has used progressive encoding like JPEG2000 for niche web viewing applications, but not for operationalizing multi-resolution streaming from a single copy. The Amazon HealthLake toolkit does use HTJ2K but only for raw DICOM images, whereas MIST supports various formats like NifTI and PNG. Also, existing tools don't have the capability to splice and stream partial byte streams that is core to MIST's efficiency.

The impact is a dramatic reduction in storage and bandwidth needs for hosting and accessing medical image databases like TCIA. The authors demonstrate high compression ratios and substantial bandwidth savings in streaming three different datasets, with rigorous evaluation of lossless and lossy reconstruction quality. Downstream tasks like deep learning classification and segmentation on progressive images vs downsampled images show no significant performance differences.

Compared to other medical image compression methods like JPEG and JPEG2000, MIST provides novel capabilities for streaming multi-resolution data on demand. The imaging community has been enthusiastic about integrating HTJ2K in standards like DICOMWeb, and MIST operationalizes it in an open-source toolkit tailored for medical images. This can greatly improve accessibility and efficiencies in large-scale imaging datasets.

The limitations compared to prior art are the loss of precision in encoding float images and overhead of handling 3D data. But the authors provide clear plans to address these limitations in future work. Overall, MIST seems like an important open-source contribution to enable multi-resolution streaming for medical images, advancing capabilities beyond prior progressive encoding tools.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions based on the work presented in this paper:

- Conduct more extensive validation of the MIST framework, beyond just deep learning applications, to fully evaluate it for downstream analyses like radiomics and clinical use cases. They suggest in-depth diagnostic equivalence reader studies with radiologists to ensure it maintains diagnostic quality.

- Address current limitations of MIST before deployment, such as the minor loss of image fidelity during encoding and limitations in handling 3D medical imaging data. They propose specific technical solutions like extending precision to 16-bit and better integration of the OpenJPH library.

- Extend the MIST framework to support additional medical imaging formats and modalities beyond the ones demonstrated.

- Evaluate the performance and efficiency of MIST at larger scales, with more datasets, users, and use cases. The authors propose a thorough analysis of the reduction in bandwidth, storage, and compute requirements.

- Analyze the reduction in carbon footprint and environmental impact enabled by MIST's improved efficiency in transmitting and processing medical images.

- Explore modifications to the progressive encoding process to further optimize encoding for medical images specifically, beyond using off-the-shelf codecs.

- Investigate the use of variable/adaptive compression levels in the encoding process based on imaging characteristics to maximize compression without sacrificing diagnostic quality.

- Develop enhanced user interfaces and experiences for requesting and visualizing progressive medical image streaming through MIST.

In summary, the authors propose further technical development and validation of MIST, as well as analyses of its efficiency and environmental benefits at scale, and exploring specialized modifications and optimizations of progressive encoding tailored for medical images.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MIST, an open-source framework to enable progressive resolution for streaming medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy. Large medical imaging datasets are cumbersome for users to download due to their massive size. However, users often only require lower resolution versions of the images. MIST utilizes the HTJ2K codec to progressively encode images into multiple resolutions that can be selectively streamed to users based on their requirements. Experiments on three large datasets - NIH Chest X-Ray, MSD Liver CT, and UPENN-GBM brain MRI - demonstrate MIST's ability to dramatically reduce bandwidth, storage, and compute requirements by over 90% while maintaining image quality. MIST has the potential to significantly optimize medical imaging infrastructure by storing images at a single resolution while sending them at multiple user-requested resolutions. Evaluations show comparable performance of deep learning models trained on MIST streamed images versus conventionally downsampled images. In summary, MIST provides an efficient and scalable solution to stream medical images at customized resolutions from a single high-quality encoded copy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MIST, an open-source framework to enable efficient streaming of medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy. Currently, large medical image datasets like those hosted on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) require users to download the full high-resolution images before processing them to their desired resolution. This is inefficient in terms of bandwidth, storage, and compute. MIST aims to address this by using progressive resolution techniques to encode the images once at high resolution, but allow users to stream and reconstruct them at multiple lower resolutions. 

The authors demonstrate MIST's capabilities on three datasets - chest x-rays, liver CTs, and brain MRIs - showing substantial reductions in required bandwidth and storage (over 90% savings), while maintaining image quality. MIST dramatically reduced infrastructure requirements for both data hosts and users, with downstream tests showing comparable performance to models trained on full resolution images. The authors conclude that MIST represents a promising solution to significantly improve the efficiency of working with large-scale medical image data. Its open-source and modular nature could allow integration into existing data pipelines and infrastructure.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes MIST (Medical Image Streaming Toolkit), an open-source framework to enable streaming of medical images at multiple resolutions from a single high-resolution copy. The key method is the use of a progressive resolution (PR) codec called High-Throughput JPEG 2000 (HTJ2K) to encode images into progressive decompositions that can be decoded into different resolutions by selecting different byte subsets. MIST implements this by 1) using HTJ2K to progressively encode medical images, 2) generating a stream optimization map to map byte subsets to resolutions, and 3) providing APIs to request, decode, and reconstruct images at desired resolutions using the map. The method is evaluated by encoding 3 datasets (CT, MRI, X-ray), streaming subsets at lower resolutions, and training deep learning models, showing dramatic reductions in required bandwidth and storage while maintaining model performance. Overall, the main method is the implementation and evaluation of a PR framework using HTJ2K to enable efficient streaming of medical images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is the inefficiency of current approaches to storing and streaming large medical imaging datasets. Some key points:

- Large medical imaging datasets (e.g. from TCIA) are very large, often 100s of GBs or more. This is a bottleneck for users with limited bandwidth or storage. 

- Many users don't even need the full resolution images, as they often downsample them for tasks like training AI models. So users end up downloading huge datasets just to downsample them later.

- It's impractical to store multiple copies of the datasets at different resolutions to accommodate different users' needs.

- Progressive image encoding methods like HTJ2K allow encoding images at a single high resolution while allowing different subsets of the data to be streamed for lower resolutions. 

- But current software tools don't fully enable operationalizing progressive encoding for medical images across formats and for streaming subsets of the encoded data.

So in summary, the key problem is the inefficiency of current approaches to storing and distributing large medical image datasets, which end up wasting storage, bandwidth, and compute resources. The paper proposes a toolkit called MIST to leverage progressive encoding to address this.
