# [Verification of Neural Reachable Tubes via Scenario Optimization and   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08604)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two probabilistic safety verification methods for neural reachable tubes - sets of safe system states over time learned by neural networks. The methods trade off resilience to inevitable neural network errors against the strength of the safety guarantee. One method is based on robust scenario optimization, the other on conformal prediction. The authors prove the two methods are equivalent, unifying the disparate fields of conformal prediction and scenario optimization. To recover greater safe volumes from neural tubes despite errors, the authors propose an outlier-adjusted approach that retrains the neural network by focusing on reducing optimistic errors revealed by simulation. Case studies on multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing highlight the ability to recover additional safe volumes. Overall, the methods and insights represent important progress towards reliable application of learning-based reachable set computation to assure safety in real-world high-dimensional autonomous systems.
