# [Verification of Neural Reachable Tubes via Scenario Optimization and   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08604)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two probabilistic safety verification methods for neural reachable tubes - sets of safe system states over time learned by neural networks. The methods trade off resilience to inevitable neural network errors against the strength of the safety guarantee. One method is based on robust scenario optimization, the other on conformal prediction. The authors prove the two methods are equivalent, unifying the disparate fields of conformal prediction and scenario optimization. To recover greater safe volumes from neural tubes despite errors, the authors propose an outlier-adjusted approach that retrains the neural network by focusing on reducing optimistic errors revealed by simulation. Case studies on multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing highlight the ability to recover additional safe volumes. Overall, the methods and insights represent important progress towards reliable application of learning-based reachable set computation to assure safety in real-world high-dimensional autonomous systems.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for computing reachable sets and safety controllers for general nonlinear systems subject to disturbances and constraints. However, it scales poorly to high-dimensional systems.
- Recently, neural approaches like DeepReach have been proposed to learn neural reachable tubes for high-dimensional systems. But verifying their safety is challenging. Prior iterative sampling-based method is sensitive to errors in the neural tube.

Proposed Solutions: 
1. Robust scenario optimization method: Provides probabilistic safety guarantees for any neural tube based on empirical outlier rate from samples. Enables tradeoff between tube resilience and safety strength.

2. Conformal prediction method: Equivalent to above method. Provides safety guarantee in terms of Beta distribution over fraction of safe volume. First proof showing conformal prediction reduces to scenario optimization.

3. Outlier-adjusted approach: Retrains neural tube to better match cost function and recover larger safe volumes for a target safety level.

Main Contributions:
- Probabilistic verification methods for neural reachable tubes that allow resilience to errors via safety violation rate
- Proof of equivalence between conformal prediction and scenario optimization
- Outlier-adjusted approach to recover greater safe volumes by retraining tube 
- Demonstrations on high-dimensional collision avoidance and rocket landing problems

Overall, the paper provides important advances towards using learned reachable tubes for safety-critical control of complex high-dimensional systems. The proposed verification and outlier adjustment methods significantly enhance the real-world applicability of approaches like DeepReach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes probabilistic safety verification methods for neural reachable tubes that enable a trade-off between resilience to errors in the tubes and strength of the safety guarantee, shows an equivalence between split conformal prediction and robust scenario optimization, and leverages information about the neural tube's error distribution to recover greater safe volumes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing two probabilistic safety verification methods (based on robust scenario optimization and conformal prediction) for neural reachable tubes that allow trading off between resilience to errors and strength of the safety guarantee.

2) Proving that split conformal prediction reduces to a scenario optimization problem in general. This shows an equivalence between the two methods not only for verification of neural tubes but more broadly, linking the fields of conformal prediction and scenario optimization.  

3) Proposing an outlier-adjusted verification approach that recovers greater safe volumes from tubes by retraining the neural reachable tube based on cost labels.

4) Demonstrating the proposed approaches on high-dimensional problems of multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing with no-go zones.

In summary, the key contributions are providing probabilistic safety verification methods for neural reachable tubes that are resilient to errors, showing an equivalence between methods coming from different communities, and leveraging information about errors to recover greater safe volumes. The efficacy of the approaches is shown on high-dimensional safety-critical systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two different verification methods - one based on robust scenario optimization and the other on conformal prediction. It then shows an equivalence between the two methods. What is the intuition behind this equivalence? Does it imply a deeper connection between scenario optimization and conformal prediction in general?

2. The outlier-adjusted verification approach proposed in the paper recovers larger safe volumes by retraining the neural reachable tube to better reflect the cost function. What challenges might one face in scaling this approach to very high-dimensional systems? How can the retraining be done efficiently?

3. The paper demonstrates the approaches on a 9D vehicle collision avoidance problem and a 6D rocket landing problem. What further innovations in neural representation learning and neural ODE solvers might enable scaling the approaches to handle even higher-dimensional systems with 20, 30 or more states? 

4. The verification approaches provide probabilistic safety guarantees that tradeoff between resilience to errors and strength of guarantees. What other ways can this tradeoff be expressed and how might a practitioner choose between different tradeoff options?

5. The probabilistic safety guarantees hold for the neural reachable tube under the induced policy. What additional verification challenges arise if one wants guarantees for a policy that is computed online or updated over time?

6. What role can formal verification methods like abstraction and model checking play alongside the proposed statistical verification methods? How can they complement each other?

7. The paper considers safety specifications that require avoiding certain target sets or reaching certain target sets. How can more complex temporal logic specifications be handled? What are the challenges?

8. What modifications would be needed to provide safety guarantees in the presence of worst-case disturbances instead of stochastic disturbances?

9. The proposed methods apply to autonomous systems operating in a known, fixed environment. What innovations would be needed to provide safety verification for systems operating in uncertain, dynamic environments?

10. The verification methods operate on a given candidate neural reachable tube. How can these methods guide the training process of the reachable tube itself to improve its verifiability?
