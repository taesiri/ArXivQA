# [Verification of Neural Reachable Tubes via Scenario Optimization and   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08604)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two probabilistic safety verification methods for neural reachable tubes - sets of safe system states over time learned by neural networks. The methods trade off resilience to inevitable neural network errors against the strength of the safety guarantee. One method is based on robust scenario optimization, the other on conformal prediction. The authors prove the two methods are equivalent, unifying the disparate fields of conformal prediction and scenario optimization. To recover greater safe volumes from neural tubes despite errors, the authors propose an outlier-adjusted approach that retrains the neural network by focusing on reducing optimistic errors revealed by simulation. Case studies on multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing highlight the ability to recover additional safe volumes. Overall, the methods and insights represent important progress towards reliable application of learning-based reachable set computation to assure safety in real-world high-dimensional autonomous systems.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for computing reachable sets and safety controllers for general nonlinear systems subject to disturbances and constraints. However, it scales poorly to high-dimensional systems.
- Recently, neural approaches like DeepReach have been proposed to learn neural reachable tubes for high-dimensional systems. But verifying their safety is challenging. Prior iterative sampling-based method is sensitive to errors in the neural tube.

Proposed Solutions: 
1. Robust scenario optimization method: Provides probabilistic safety guarantees for any neural tube based on empirical outlier rate from samples. Enables tradeoff between tube resilience and safety strength.

2. Conformal prediction method: Equivalent to above method. Provides safety guarantee in terms of Beta distribution over fraction of safe volume. First proof showing conformal prediction reduces to scenario optimization.

3. Outlier-adjusted approach: Retrains neural tube to better match cost function and recover larger safe volumes for a target safety level.

Main Contributions:
- Probabilistic verification methods for neural reachable tubes that allow resilience to errors via safety violation rate
- Proof of equivalence between conformal prediction and scenario optimization
- Outlier-adjusted approach to recover greater safe volumes by retraining tube 
- Demonstrations on high-dimensional collision avoidance and rocket landing problems

Overall, the paper provides important advances towards using learned reachable tubes for safety-critical control of complex high-dimensional systems. The proposed verification and outlier adjustment methods significantly enhance the real-world applicability of approaches like DeepReach.
