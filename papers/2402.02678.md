# [Counterfactual Explanations of Black-box Machine Learning Models using   Causal Discovery with Applications to Credit Rating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02678)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainable AI (XAI) methods that provide counterfactual explanations using causal models require the causal graph between features to be known. However, in most real-world applications, the causal relationships are unknown. This limits the applicability of such XAI methods that rely on causal graphs. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new XAI framework that relaxes the constraint that the causal graph needs to be known. The key ideas are:

1) Use causal discovery algorithms to estimate the causal graph from data, while using some useful prior causal structure information:
   - Target variable is a sink variable (no variable causes it)
   - Target variable has direct causal relationships with all explanatory variables

2) Explain black-box model predictions by estimating counterfactual explanation scores like necessity, sufficiency and reversal probability scores using the estimated causal graph.

Main Contributions:

- Analysis of how different causal structures affect counterfactual explanation scores
- Proposal of useful prior causal structure information to improve causal discovery
- Numerical experiments on artificial data showing the proposed method can recover importance scores closer to true values compared to assuming no graph
- First application of counterfactual XAI with causal discovery on real financial credit rating data from Shiga Bank, demonstrating usefulness even when true causal graph is unknown

The method provides a practical way to apply counterfactual explanation methods using causal models to real-world applications where the causal relationships are typically unknown. By combining causal discovery and prior causal knowledge, reasonable estimates of feature importance scores could be obtained.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel explainable AI framework that combines estimated causal graphs from causal discovery and counterfactual explanations to provide improved explanations of black-box machine learning model predictions without requiring complete knowledge of the causal relationships between features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new XAI framework that combines causal structure information and causal discovery to provide counterfactual explanations without assuming the causal graph is fully known. 

2. Analyzing the effects of different causal structures on explanation scores and proposing useful prior information on the causal structure to help with causal discovery.

3. Conducting numerical experiments showing the proposed method can better estimate explanation scores compared to not using causal discovery, even when the true causal graph is unknown.

4. Applying the method to real-world financial data to demonstrate its usefulness in explaining predictions from a black-box credit rating model when the causal relationships between features are unknown.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a way to provide counterfactual explanations from black-box models by integrating causal discovery techniques, without needing the full causal graph as required by previous methods like LEWIS. This helps expand the applicability of such causal model-based explainability approaches to real-world problems where causal relationships are often not fully known.

The paper proposes a new XAI framework that combines counterfactual explanations and causal discovery to explain black-box machine learning models, without assuming the causal graph is fully known. It introduces usefulness scores based on counterfactual probabilities and analyzes the effects of different causal structures. The method is demonstrated on a real-world credit rating classification task, where the causal graph is estimated using algorithms like PC and LiNGAM with certain structural assumptions. So the key focus is on explainable AI, counterfactuals, causality and structure learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new XAI framework that relaxes the constraint of the causal graph being known. What are the key ideas behind this framework and how does it differ from previous methods? 

2. The paper analyzes the effects of different causal structures on explanation scores. What were some of the key insights from this analysis in terms of determining useful prior information about the causal structure?

3. The paper proposes two specific pieces of prior information on the causal structure to help estimate explanation scores. Explain what each of these refers to and why they are useful.  

4. What were the main causal discovery algorithms used in the numerical experiments? What assumptions did each make about the functional form and error term distributions?

5. In the numerical experiments, what metrics were used to evaluate how well the estimated explanation scores matched the true explanation scores? Why were both accuracy and order-based metrics necessary?

6. What were some of the key results from the numerical experiments in the linear causal structure case? How did accuracy change with distributional assumptions and incorporation of prior causal information?

7. The real data application involved credit rating predictions - explain how the causal analysis provided more sensible explanations than simply ignoring the causal structure. What were some domain insights?   

8. The paper focuses on estimating the necessity and sufficiency score for counterfactual explanations. How do the necessity and sufficiency scores provide complementary insights? 

9. What are some ways the method could be extended, for example to multi-class classification problems? What open questions remain about the validity of the proposed prior causal information?

10. A key contribution of the paper is demonstrating how causal discovery algorithms can be integrated into counterfactual XAI systems when causal knowledge is incomplete. What are some other potential applications where this approach could be beneficial?
