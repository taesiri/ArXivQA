# [MPI Planar Correction of Pulse Based ToF Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12064)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are popular for perception in robotics, but suffer from multi-path interference (MPI) artifacts, especially on curved surfaces. 
- MPI causes distorted and noisy depth measurements on planar surfaces, making spatial data preprocessing like plane extraction difficult.
- Existing methods for handling MPI rely on modeling of continuous wave ToF cameras, use synthetic datasets, or require expensive sensors to collect ground truth depth data. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an end-to-end deep learning method to reduce MPI artifacts on planar surfaces in data from pulse-based ToF cameras.  
- They use a two-stage Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) planar extraction method to generate planar ground truth depth images from the raw noisy input depth images.
- These ground truth planar patches are used to train a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to estimate the MPI artifacts.

Contributions:
- Real training data generated from raw ToF camera input using sample consensus planar extraction  
- Custom loss function defined using point cloud coordinates to capture 3D spatial distortions
- Curvature gradient metric to quantify planar distortions without scale effects
- Trained FPN model that reduces MPI artifacts on planes in real indoor ToF data
- Improved planar surface smoothing while retaining edges on indoor mobile robot tests
- Method and training framework extensible to other geometric shapes and outlier removal

In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end deep learning approach using FPNs to reduce MPI artifacts on planar surfaces in real pulse-based ToF depth camera data, without requiring extra sensors or synthetic data generation. The results show improved planar segmentation is achievable using this method.
