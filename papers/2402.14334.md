# [INSTRUCTIR: A Benchmark for Instruction Following of Information   Retrieval Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Despite the need to align search targets with user intentions, current retrievers often just prioritize query information without considering the user's intended search context. 
- Enhancing retrievers to understand user instructions/preferences could yield more aligned search results, but has not been well-studied.  
- Prior work limits instructions to task descriptions rather than diverse real-world scenarios. 
- Current benchmarks lack tailoring to assess instruction-following ability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new benchmark called InstructIR specifically designed to evaluate instruction-following in information retrieval.  
- InstructIR focuses on user-aligned instructions tailored to each query instance, reflecting real-world diversity.
- They collect 9,906 instance-wise instructions involving user details like job, background, goals etc. 
- A multi-stage pipeline with GPT-4 is used to generate instructions and revise targets to align with them.
- Systematic filtering and human verification ensure dataset quality.
- A Robustness score metrics quantifies ability to follow changing instructions.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark particularly focused on evaluating instruction-following for retrievers.
- Instance-specific user-aligned instructions unlike task descriptions in prior work.  
- Find tuned instruction-following models can underperform regular counterparts, indicating potential overfitting.
- Scaling model size and instruction-tuning both significantly boost performance.
- Analysis sheds light on capability of different retrieval systems.
- Could accelerate progress in building controllable retrievers.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel benchmark to fill gaps in evaluating and improving instruction-following capabilities of information retrieval systems in order to make them better align with diverse real-world user needs. The benchmark, analysis and insights contribute to advancing work on more user-aligned retrievers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces InstructIR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of information retrieval models to follow diverse user-aligned instructions tailored to each query instance, in order to better align search results with users' intentions and preferences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposal of a new benchmark called InstructIR that is designed to evaluate the instruction-following ability of information retrieval models. Key aspects of this benchmark include:

- It uses instance-wise, user-aligned instructions tailored to each query to reflect diverse real-world search scenarios, unlike existing benchmarks that use coarser task descriptions. 

- It contains 9,906 instances covering a variety of instructions involving user details like job, background, interests, etc.

- It introduces a "Robustness" metric to quantify how consistently models can follow evolving instructions for the same query.

- Experiments demonstrate issues in existing instruction-tuned retrievers like overfitting to limited styles of instructions seen during training. The benchmark helps gain insights into model capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of InstructIR as a novel benchmark to assess and advance the instruction-following capabilities of information retrieval systems to make them better at understanding user needs and preferences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called InstructIR for evaluating the instruction following capabilities of information retrieval models. What are some of the key limitations of existing benchmarks that InstructIR aims to address?

2. One of the main contributions of InstructIR is the use of instance-wise instructions tailored to each query. How does this differ from the task/dataset-level instructions used in prior benchmarks? What are some of the advantages of using instance-wise instructions?

3. The paper describes a multi-stage pipeline for creating the InstructIR dataset using GPT-4. Can you walk through the key steps in this pipeline and how they ensure diversity and quality of the generated data? 

4. The InstructIR benchmark uses a new evaluation metric called "Robustness score" to quantify how consistently models can follow evolving instructions for the same query. How is this metric calculated? What does it capture that metrics like nDCG may miss?

5. The experiments reveal that some instruction-tuned retrieval models like INSTRUCTOR underperform compared to non-instruction-tuned counterparts on InstructIR. What does this suggest about potential issues in how existing models have been trained to follow instructions?

6. The analysis shows better performance from instruction-tuned language models and larger backbone models on InstructIR. Why do you think model scale plays an important role here? What capabilities are needed?

7. One analysis tests prompt sensitivity by paraphrasing instructions. Which models show high sensitivity vs robustness to such changes? What factors contribute to this difference across models?

8. How exactly does the paper test for and analyze lexical bias in the InstructIR dataset? What do the results imply about reliance on lexical cues vs deeper understanding? 

9. Can you discuss some of the limitations of the InstructIR benchmark and dataset highlighted in the paper? How can future work address these limitations?

10. The authors suggest potential future work like using reinforcement learning from human feedback to better align retrievers to user intentions. Can you expand on why this is a promising direction and how it can be realized?
