# [INSTRUCTIR: A Benchmark for Instruction Following of Information   Retrieval Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Despite the need to align search targets with user intentions, current retrievers often just prioritize query information without considering the user's intended search context. 
- Enhancing retrievers to understand user instructions/preferences could yield more aligned search results, but has not been well-studied.  
- Prior work limits instructions to task descriptions rather than diverse real-world scenarios. 
- Current benchmarks lack tailoring to assess instruction-following ability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new benchmark called InstructIR specifically designed to evaluate instruction-following in information retrieval.  
- InstructIR focuses on user-aligned instructions tailored to each query instance, reflecting real-world diversity.
- They collect 9,906 instance-wise instructions involving user details like job, background, goals etc. 
- A multi-stage pipeline with GPT-4 is used to generate instructions and revise targets to align with them.
- Systematic filtering and human verification ensure dataset quality.
- A Robustness score metrics quantifies ability to follow changing instructions.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark particularly focused on evaluating instruction-following for retrievers.
- Instance-specific user-aligned instructions unlike task descriptions in prior work.  
- Find tuned instruction-following models can underperform regular counterparts, indicating potential overfitting.
- Scaling model size and instruction-tuning both significantly boost performance.
- Analysis sheds light on capability of different retrieval systems.
- Could accelerate progress in building controllable retrievers.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel benchmark to fill gaps in evaluating and improving instruction-following capabilities of information retrieval systems in order to make them better align with diverse real-world user needs. The benchmark, analysis and insights contribute to advancing work on more user-aligned retrievers.
