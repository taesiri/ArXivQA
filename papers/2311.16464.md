# [Bridging the Gap: A Unified Video Comprehension Framework for Moment   Retrieval and Highlight Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16464)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unified video comprehension framework called UVCOM to effectively address both moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) in videos. The authors observe that MR necessitates understanding local relationships while HD prioritizes global context, and existing methods fail to associate these intrinsic differences. To bridge this gap, UVCOM performs progressive integration across multiple modalities and granularities for comprehensive understanding. Specifically, it uses a Comprehensive Integration Module with dual branches to aggregate intra-modality context, a Local Relation Perception module to enhance temporal and inter-modality interactions, and global knowledge accumulation to understand the entire video. Furthermore, multi-aspect contrastive learning is introduced to align clip-text semantics and discriminate unrelated videos and text. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with significant gains over prior arts in both tasks. Ablations validate the efficacy of the unified modeling and rationality of the framework design. Overall, by effectively associating the characteristics of the two tasks, UVCOM achieves a new level of video comprehension through joint MR and HD.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified video comprehension framework called UVCOM that effectively bridges the gap between moment retrieval and highlight detection by performing progressive integration across modalities and granularities to achieve local temporal relationship modeling and global context accumulation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified video comprehension framework called UVCOM to effectively bridge the gap between moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD). The key points are:

1) UVCOM follows two principles for framework design to address the different emphasis of MR and HD: a) local relation activation for MR to understand local relationships, b) global knowledge accumulation for HD to focus on global context.

2) A Comprehensive Integration Module (CIM) is proposed to progressively facilitate integration within and across modalities and granularities. This achieves locality perception and global video understanding.  

3) A multi-aspect contrastive learning method is introduced to consolidate local relation modeling via clip-text alignment and enhance global knowledge quality via video-linguistic discrimination.

4) Extensive experiments show UVCOM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmarks. For example, it improves over previous best methods by 5.97% on MR and 3.31% on HD on the TACoS dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the UVCOM framework to effectively unify moment retrieval and highlight detection by bridging their differences with specialized designs for comprehensive video understanding.
