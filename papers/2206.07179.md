# [Proximal Splitting Adversarial Attacks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07179)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How to develop an effective white-box adversarial attack for deep semantic segmentation models that can produce minimal perturbations with small L-infinity norms?

The key points are:

- Prior work on adversarial attacks has focused mostly on classification tasks, with limited work on attacks for semantic segmentation models.

- Existing attacks for segmentation models do not accurately solve the adversarial segmentation problem and overestimate the size of perturbations needed to fool models. 

- The authors propose a new white-box attack using a proximal splitting method and augmented Lagrangian approach to handle the large number of pixel-wise constraints and minimize the L-infinity norm of perturbations.

- The attack is demonstrated to significantly outperform prior attacks, finding much smaller adversarial perturbations for segmentation models on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets. 

So in summary, the main research goal is to develop a more effective adversarial attack for semantic segmentation that generates minimal perturbations, providing a better way to evaluate robustness of these models. The key hypothesis seems to be that prior attacks overestimate the perturbation sizes needed, which their new method aims to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new white-box adversarial attack method for semantic segmentation models that is able to generate minimal perturbations with small L-infinity norms. 

2. The attack is based on an Augmented Lagrangian approach with adaptive strategies to handle the large number of pixel-wise constraints in semantic segmentation (>1 million typically).

3. It uses a proximal splitting method to handle the non-smooth L-infinity norm minimization objective, and shows an efficient way to compute the associated proximity operator.

4. The attack significantly outperforms prior attacks designed for segmentation like DAG and adapted classification attacks like PGD, generating much smaller perturbations on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 with various architectures.

5. The attack reveals that segmentation models are much less robust than previously estimated, with near-zero mIoU obtained for norms <1/255, challenging prior robustness evaluations.

6. The attack provides a benchmark and framework for further research on adversarial robustness of semantic segmentation models. Overall, it advances the state-of-the-art in generating minimal adversarial examples for dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

In summary, the key novelty is the proximal splitting approach combined with adaptive constraint handling strategies to enable minimal adversarial perturbations for segmentation models with millions of constraints. This reveals greater vulnerability of segmentation models than previously shown.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new white-box adversarial attack for semantic segmentation models that uses a proximal splitting method to efficiently produce smaller adversarial perturbations compared to prior attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on adversarial attacks for semantic segmentation:

- Most prior work has focused on classification tasks rather than dense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper helps fill that gap by proposing a new attack method tailored for segmentation models.

- The few existing attacks for segmentation like DAG don't optimize to find minimal perturbations. They tend to accumulate gradient until misclassifying a target percent of pixels. This can overestimate model robustness. 

- In contrast, this paper formulates the problem as an optimization that minimizes the L-infinity norm while constraining misclassifications. The attack uses an augmented Lagrangian approach to handle the large number of pixel-wise constraints.

- Proximal splitting methods are leveraged to accommodate the non-smooth L-infinity norm objective. The authors derive an efficient way to compute the proximity operator needed. 

- Experiments demonstrate the attack finds much smaller perturbations compared to prior segmentation attacks and adapted classification attacks. For instance, under 1/255 max perturbation fools Cityscapes models over 99% of pixels.

- The work provides a more rigorous adversarial attack and benchmark compared to previous segmentation methods. This gives a better assessment of robustness for segmentation networks.

In summary, the key novelties are an optimization-based attack for minimal segmentation perturbations, handling the large number of constraints, and using proximal methods to accommodate the L-infinity norm. The result is a stronger attack that reveals greater fragility of segmentation models than prior attacks demonstrated.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing adversarial attacks and evaluating robustness for other dense prediction tasks like object detection and depth estimation. The methods proposed could likely be extended, but it needs to be investigated.

- Designing targeted attacks with semantically consistent target labels for dense prediction tasks. The authors use a smoothed majority label for Cityscapes, but better approaches may exist.

- Evaluating the robustness of architectures beyond CNNs and transformers, as other types of models become popular for segmentation. For example, vision transformers were recently introduced for this task.

- Scaling up adversarial attacks and evaluations to higher resolution images. The memory requirements are prohibitive right now for models trained at original image sizes.

- Investigating certified or provable robustness for semantic segmentation models, instead of empirical robustness evaluations. This is an open challenge even for classification.

- Developing segmentation models more robust to the proposed attacks, using adversarial training or other techniques. The attacks reveal the limited robustness of current models.

- Extending the attacks and evaluations to other perturbation threat models like $\ell_1, \ell_2$ norms, or more realistic perturbations. Most works focus on $\ell_\infty$ perturbations.

In summary, the main research directions are around developing better attacks, evaluating new model architectures, scaling up to larger images, improving robustness, and extending the threat model considered. The paper provides a solid benchmark for future work on adversarial robustness in semantic segmentation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new white-box adversarial attack for fooling deep semantic segmentation models by generating minimal perturbations with respect to the L-infinity norm. The attack is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach to handle the large number of pixelwise misclassification constraints and uses a proximal splitting method to accommodate the non-smooth L-infinity norm objective. Adaptive strategies are introduced to deal with millions of constraints, including constraint masking and scaling. Additionally, an efficient algorithm is presented to compute the proximity operator for the L-infinity norm plus indicator function. Experiments demonstrate that the attack significantly outperforms prior methods and provides much lower L-infinity norms than previous attacks across various architectures and datasets. This enables more accurate evaluation of model robustness compared to prior works which overestimated required perturbation sizes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new white-box adversarial attack method for semantic segmentation models. Previous attack methods for segmentation have struggled to generate minimal adversarial perturbations due to the dense, pixel-level nature of the task. The proposed method uses an augmented Lagrangian approach to handle the large number of pixel-wise constraints. It also employs a proximal splitting method to minimize the L-infinity norm of perturbations. Adaptive strategies are introduced to scale and mask constraints over the optimization process. Experiments demonstrate that this attack significantly outperforms previous methods, like the DAG attack, on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets. It is able to find smaller adversarial perturbations for all models tested, including robust models like DeepLabV3 DDC-AT. The attack highlights that segmentation models are much more vulnerable to adversarial examples than previously thought.

In summary, the key contributions are:
1) An augmented Lagrangian framework to handle pixel-level constraints when attacking segmentation models. This allows gradient-based optimization.
2) Use of proximal splitting methods to minimize the L-infinity norm of perturbations. The proximity operator for the sum of L-infinity norm and indicator function is computed efficiently.  
3) Adaptive constraint scaling and masking strategies to improve optimization.
4) Experimental results showing the attack finds much smaller perturbations than previous methods for several segmentation models and datasets. This provides a more accurate adversarial robustness evaluation.
