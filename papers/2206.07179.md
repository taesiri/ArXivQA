# [Proximal Splitting Adversarial Attacks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07179)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How to develop an effective white-box adversarial attack for deep semantic segmentation models that can produce minimal perturbations with small L-infinity norms?

The key points are:

- Prior work on adversarial attacks has focused mostly on classification tasks, with limited work on attacks for semantic segmentation models.

- Existing attacks for segmentation models do not accurately solve the adversarial segmentation problem and overestimate the size of perturbations needed to fool models. 

- The authors propose a new white-box attack using a proximal splitting method and augmented Lagrangian approach to handle the large number of pixel-wise constraints and minimize the L-infinity norm of perturbations.

- The attack is demonstrated to significantly outperform prior attacks, finding much smaller adversarial perturbations for segmentation models on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets. 

So in summary, the main research goal is to develop a more effective adversarial attack for semantic segmentation that generates minimal perturbations, providing a better way to evaluate robustness of these models. The key hypothesis seems to be that prior attacks overestimate the perturbation sizes needed, which their new method aims to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new white-box adversarial attack method for semantic segmentation models that is able to generate minimal perturbations with small L-infinity norms. 

2. The attack is based on an Augmented Lagrangian approach with adaptive strategies to handle the large number of pixel-wise constraints in semantic segmentation (>1 million typically).

3. It uses a proximal splitting method to handle the non-smooth L-infinity norm minimization objective, and shows an efficient way to compute the associated proximity operator.

4. The attack significantly outperforms prior attacks designed for segmentation like DAG and adapted classification attacks like PGD, generating much smaller perturbations on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 with various architectures.

5. The attack reveals that segmentation models are much less robust than previously estimated, with near-zero mIoU obtained for norms <1/255, challenging prior robustness evaluations.

6. The attack provides a benchmark and framework for further research on adversarial robustness of semantic segmentation models. Overall, it advances the state-of-the-art in generating minimal adversarial examples for dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

In summary, the key novelty is the proximal splitting approach combined with adaptive constraint handling strategies to enable minimal adversarial perturbations for segmentation models with millions of constraints. This reveals greater vulnerability of segmentation models than previously shown.
