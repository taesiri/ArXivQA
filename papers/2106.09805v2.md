# [Shuffle Private Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09805v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop differentially private stochastic convex optimization algorithms in the shuffle model of privacy. Specifically, the paper introduces new shuffle private protocols for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm, and leverages this to construct both sequentially interactive and fully interactive shuffle private stochastic convex optimization algorithms. The main hypotheses seem to be:1) It is possible to develop a shuffle private protocol for vector summation that improves on prior work by using multiple messages per user and providing instance-specific privacy guarantees. 2) This vector summation protocol can be incorporated into stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithms like SGD and accelerated SGD to obtain good utility guarantees in the shuffle model, surpassing what is possible with local DP.3) Making a distinction between sequentially interactive and fully interactive shuffle protocols enables stronger utility guarantees through full interactivity while recognizing that sequential interactivity may be more practical.So in summary, the central research direction is advancing the theory and practice of differentially private stochastic convex optimization in the shuffle model by introducing new vector summation tools and using them to develop the first interactive shuffle private optimization algorithms. The paper hypothesizes that this approach can lead to substantially better utility than local DP and match central DP in some cases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces sequentially interactive and fully interactive variants of the shuffle model of differential privacy. This distinguishes between protocols where each user participates only once (sequential) versus protocols that can query users multiple times (fully interactive). 2. It provides a new shuffle private protocol for summing vectors with bounded l2 norm sensitivity. This protocol uses multiple messages per user to reduce the noise variance compared to prior work.3. It leverages the vector summation protocol to develop new sequentially and fully interactive protocols for stochastic convex optimization with improved accuracy guarantees compared to local differential privacy. Specifically:- For sequentially interactive protocols, it achieves excess population loss Õ(d^(1/3)/n^(2/3)) for general convex functions and Õ(d/n^2) for strongly convex functions. - For fully interactive protocols, it matches the Õ(sqrt(d)/n) guarantee of central differential privacy up to polylog factors.So in summary, the main contribution is introducing new variants of the shuffle model, providing better protocols for vector summation and using these to obtain improved utility guarantees for convex optimization under shuffle differential privacy constraints.
