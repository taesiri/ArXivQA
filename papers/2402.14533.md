# [Whose LLM is it Anyway? Linguistic Comparison and LLM Attribution for   GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Bard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates whether different large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Bard exhibit distinct linguistic styles in the text they generate, similar to how human authors have unique writing styles. It is unclear if LLMs also display such variability. 

Methods:
The authors build on an existing corpus (HC3) containing human and GPT-3.5 responses, and extend it (LC2 corpus) to also include matched GPT-4 and Bard responses over 5 datasets. They analyze linguistic differences across LLMs in vocabulary, part-of-speech distribution, dependency parsing and sentiment. Statistical tests compare the differences, which are then used to train a model to attribute text to the LLM it came from.

Key Findings:
The results reveal statistically significant differences in vocabulary size/density, part-of-speech tag usage for common tags like nouns as well as rare tags like interjections. Differences were also found in dependency parses, with Bard differing most from the other two. But no major differences occurred in sentiment. 

Using these linguistic indicators, the attribution model could correctly classify which LLM generated a given text with 88% accuracy on average, with linguistic markers from all examined aspects being the top features.

Main Contributions:
- The first comprehensive analysis showing distinct linguistic styles for major LLMs, similar to human author styles
- The style differences, especially in vocabulary, POS and dependencies, enable effective automated attribution of text to the LLM source 
- Has theoretical implication that LLMs reproduce some language diversity like humans
- Practical uses include LLM evaluation, selection, guiding detection of AI-written text

Limitations acknowledged include small corpora size, zero-shot scenario for LLMs, and English language only analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper reports on a linguistic analysis of texts generated by GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard which reveals distinct writing styles enabling accurate attribution of texts to their LLM origin.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contribution of this paper seems to be:

1) Conducting a comprehensive linguistic analysis to compare texts generated by three major LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard - across dimensions like vocabulary, part-of-speech tags, dependency parsing, and sentiment.

2) Demonstrating through this analysis that these LLMs exhibit distinctive linguistic styles, similar to how human authors tend to have unique writing styles. Key differences were found especially in aspects like vocabulary usage, part-of-speech distributions, and dependency relations. 

3) Leveraging these linguistic style differences as markers to attribute a given text to its LLM of origin with high accuracy (88%) using a simple off-the-shelf classification model. This has implications for tasks like LLM detection and evaluating how design choices impact linguistic style.

In summary, the key contribution is showing LLMs have distinguishable linguistic styles that can be used to accurately identify the LLM that generated a given text. This parallels findings on how human writing style varies across authors and has applications in areas like LLM analysis, detection, and understanding impact of model design choices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords associated with it are:

Large Language Models (LLMs)
Writing Style  
Linguistic Analysis
GPT-3.5
GPT-4
Bard

LLM Attribution

These keywords encapsulate the main topics and focus areas covered in the paper, including analyzing the linguistic styles of major LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard across dimensions like vocabulary, POS, dependencies, and sentiment. A key goal is using these linguistic markers for LLM attribution to identify which LLM generated a given text. So the keywords reflect the linguistic analysis performed and its application to distinguishing and attributing texts to different LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using an ANOVA test with Tukey post-hoc analysis for comparing vocabulary across LLMs. What are the benefits of using Tukey's test over simpler pairwise comparisons? How does it account for multiple testing?

2. The paper utilizes Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing for comparing POS and dependency distributions. Why was this non-parametric test selected over something like a chi-squared test? What are the assumptions it makes about the underlying data distributions?

3. Sentiment analysis utilized the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. What is the rationale behind using a non-parametric test here? What simplifying assumptions did the authors likely make about the sentiment scores across LLMs?

4. The LLM attribution task used an XGBoost model. What are the key advantages of tree-based models like XGBoost over linear models for handling linguistic feature inputs? How does the model account for feature interactions?  

5. What steps could the authors take to further validate that the linguistic differences observed between LLMs are inherent style differences versus biases induced by the training data or prompting approaches?

6. The feature importance plot shows POS tags and sentiment polarity as highly predictive features. Why might these be more indicative of LLM style versus vocabulary or syntax features? What linguistic theory supports this?

7. Could the authors have utilized more syntactic features derived from the dependency parses? For example, average parse tree height or noun phrase complexity? Would these add value?

8. How sensitive do you expect the attribution model to be to changes in the prompting format, topic, or dataset size/diversity? How could the authors test for robustness systematically?

9. The authors use a simple XGBoost model for attribution. Would deep learning approaches like CNNs or LSTMs potentially improve performance? What challenges might they introduce?

10. The paper focuses solely on English text. How would you expect the linguistic patterns and attribution performance to change for other languages like Chinese or Arabic with very different grammar conventions?
