# [Uncovering communities of pipelines in the task-fMRI analytical space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06231)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the variability in fMRI analysis pipelines and how different pipelines impact study results. The authors processed an fMRI dataset using 24 pipelines that differed in 4 parameters: software package, smoothing kernel, motion regressors, and HRF derivatives. They computed statistic maps for 1000 groups of subjects with each pipeline. Pipelines were grouped into communities based on similarity of statistic maps across groups using graph theory and community detection. They found subsets of pipelines frequently grouped together, especially those sharing software package, motion regressors, and HRF derivatives. Differences across communities related to extent of activation and number of significantly activated voxels, impacted by use of HRF derivatives and software package pre-whitening approaches. Over groups and tasks, they identified stable relationships between pipelines. This method helps understand relationships and stability in the complex fMRI analytical space to tackle analytical variability, e.g. by selecting representative pipelines. Key findings are pipeline parameters like software and HRF derivatives differentiate pipeline communities, and subsets of pipelines show stability across groups, illuminating generalizable relationships in the analytical space.
