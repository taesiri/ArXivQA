# [A hierarchical control framework for autonomous decision-making systems:   Integrating HMDP and MPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous systems require decision-making capabilities to operate effectively in dynamic and uncertain environments. However, traditional control systems focus mainly on continuous dynamics rather than high-level discrete decision-making.  
- There is a lack of unified frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between low-level control systems and high-level decision-making processes. This is key for ensuring both optimality and safety.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a unified hierarchical control framework integrating Hybrid Markov Decision Processes (HMDP) and Model Predictive Control (MPC).
- HMDP provides a modeling framework that incorporates both discrete MDP states for decision-making and continuous states for underlying system dynamics.
- An MPC-based scheme is designed to solve the HMDP problem by optimizing a cost function with safety constraints over a receding horizon.

Main Contributions:
- A new HMDP formulation to model the interplay between traditional continuous dynamics and high-level discrete decision processes.
- An MPC-based algorithm to solve the HMDP problem online while ensuring recursive feasibility and stability.
- Theoretical analysis proving recursive feasibility and stability guarantees.
- Demonstrated effectiveness through case studies in autonomous lane changing scenarios, outperforming a rule-based baseline.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hierarchical control framework integrating HMDP and MPC to enable autonomous decision-making systems to operate optimally and safely in complex, uncertain environments. Both theoretical and practical effectiveness is demonstrated.

 This paper proposes a unified hierarchical control framework integrating hybrid Markov decision processes (HMDP) and model predictive control (MPC) to enable autonomous decision-making systems to generate optimal and safe actions when interacting with dynamic environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. It presents a unified modelling approach to articulate a hierarchical control framework for autonomous decision-making systems. This approach captures the intricate interplay between dynamic systems at the low level and MDP models at the high level for decision making.

2. It formulates the high-level decision making problem as an optimization problem based on the proposed HMDP model. This formulation considers the influence of both discrete MDP states and underlying continuous dynamics.

3. It proposes an MPC-based algorithm to solve the HMDP optimization problem for high-level decision making. This algorithm generates optimal and safe decisions by leveraging the predictive capabilities of MPC.

4. It establishes recursive feasibility and stability guarantees for the proposed MPC-based algorithm under mild assumptions, without needing terminal constraints.

5. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control framework through simulations of an autonomous lane changing system interacting with dynamic environments. The results showcase the framework's ability to handle diverse behaviors while ensuring both safety and optimality.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a unified HMDP/MPC control framework for autonomous decision-making systems that integrates high-level discrete decision making with low-level continuous dynamics while providing performance guarantees.
