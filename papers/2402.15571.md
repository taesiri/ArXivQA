# [Social Convos: Capturing Agendas and Emotions on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social media platforms contain huge amounts of message traffic, making it challenging to analyze influence operations within specific groups. 
- Existing methods for extracting influence indicators work at the individual message level, ignoring relationships between messages and differences in popularity.
- The relevant agenda labels for events are unknown, requiring human annotation effort. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the concept of a "convo" - an online discussion around a topic among a group of users.
- Identify convos around keywords using hashtags, topics or groups.
- Within each convo, identify the top 10 most influential authors based on retweets.
- Construct retweet networks between these influencers to analyze group dynamics.  
- Use an instruction-tuned language model to characterize convos by extracting entities, associated agendas (promoted actions) and emotions.
- Summarize the agendas to describe the viewpoint being promoted in the convo.

Main Contributions:
- A top-down approach to simultaneously detect agendas and emotions from focused message groups in a convo.  
- Using language models to process collections of messages instead of individual messages.
- Visualizations and retweet networks to represent a convo for analyzing influence operations.
- Case study on 2022 French Elections data to demonstrate the methodology.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel systematic approach to identify and characterize influential subgroups discussing topics on social media, enabling detection of coordinated influence campaigns.
