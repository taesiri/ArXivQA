# [Social Convos: Capturing Agendas and Emotions on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social media platforms contain huge amounts of message traffic, making it challenging to analyze influence operations within specific groups. 
- Existing methods for extracting influence indicators work at the individual message level, ignoring relationships between messages and differences in popularity.
- The relevant agenda labels for events are unknown, requiring human annotation effort. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the concept of a "convo" - an online discussion around a topic among a group of users.
- Identify convos around keywords using hashtags, topics or groups.
- Within each convo, identify the top 10 most influential authors based on retweets.
- Construct retweet networks between these influencers to analyze group dynamics.  
- Use an instruction-tuned language model to characterize convos by extracting entities, associated agendas (promoted actions) and emotions.
- Summarize the agendas to describe the viewpoint being promoted in the convo.

Main Contributions:
- A top-down approach to simultaneously detect agendas and emotions from focused message groups in a convo.  
- Using language models to process collections of messages instead of individual messages.
- Visualizations and retweet networks to represent a convo for analyzing influence operations.
- Case study on 2022 French Elections data to demonstrate the methodology.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel systematic approach to identify and characterize influential subgroups discussing topics on social media, enabling detection of coordinated influence campaigns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to identify influential groups spreading targeted agendas on social media by extracting focused message subsets called "convos", characterizing them using detected emotions and promoted actions, and analyzing the connections between influential authors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel systematic approach to identify influential message subsets ("convos") from social media datasets and characterize them using agendas and emotions to detect targeted influence operations. Specifically:

1) They introduce the concept of a "convo" to extract focused groups of messages around particular topics from the overall social media traffic. 

2) They identify the most influential authors in a convo based on their retweet counts.

3) They create a network of these influential authors to analyze their connections and retweet behavior, hypothesizing that a dense network indicates a deliberate influence operation.  

4) They characterize the convos using agenda and emotion detection based on instruction-tuned large language models rather than fine-tuned models. This allows detecting agendas and emotions at a collection of messages level rather than individual messages.

5) They provide a case study on the 2022 French Elections Twitter dataset to demonstrate their approach for detecting influence operations like #Frexit. The generated agenda summaries and influencer networks provide insights into the focused discussions in the corpus.

In summary, the main contribution is a top-down approach to identify and characterize influential subgroups from social media data to uncover targeted influence campaigns.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Convos - The concept of online social phenomena where people engage around a topic or activity. Used to identify focused groups of messages. 

- Influence indicators - Agenda control and use of emotional language. Used to characterize convos and identify influence operations.

- Influencers - Authors who are actively promoting a viewpoint or agenda within a convo. Their tweets are analyzed to represent the convo.

- Agenda detection - Identifying the underlying agendas promoted within a group of messages. Done using large language models. 

- Emotion detection - Detecting the emotions expressed towards entities within the convo messages. Also done via language models.

- Influence operations - Deliberate operations run by groups of users on social media to promote specific agendas. Aim to detect these. 

- Retweet networks - Networks depicting connections between influencers based on their retweeting behavior. Used to analyze group dynamics.

- 2022 French Elections - Case study and dataset used to evaluate the proposed approach for detecting influence operations.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around using the concept of convos to identify focused message groups and influencers on social media, and leveraging agenda/emotion detection to uncover targeted influence campaigns.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the concept of "convos" to identify focused groups of messages around a particular topic. What are some advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to analyzing all messages in a dataset? 

2. The paper extracts tweets from top influencers in a convo to characterize the convo. What criteria could be used besides retweet count to identify influential authors in a convo? How could you validate that the selected authors appropriately represent the convo?

3. The paper hypothesizes that a dense network of connections between top influencers indicates a deliberate influence operation. What metrics could be used to quantitatively measure the density of an influencer network? How would you determine an appropriate threshold?  

4. The prompts provided to the large language model guide it to detect entities, agendas, and emotions from a collection of messages. How were these prompts designed and refined? What challenges were faced in getting the model to generate the desired structured output?

5. The paper demonstrates the approach on a Twitter dataset. What considerations would be important if applying this method to other social media platforms like Reddit or public forums? Would changes be needed in the process for identifying convos or influencers?

6. Could this approach for characterizing convos and identifying influence operations be adapted to analyze non-political contexts like marketing campaigns or coordinated activism around social issues? What components of the method could remain the same or would need modification?  

7. The paper acknowledges possible biases in the large language models used. How were efforts made to mitigate the effects of these biases on the analysis? Could the biases still affect the characterization of the convos or identification of influence operations?  

8. Manual analysis by expert analysts is still required to validate the findings from this approach. What guidelines were provided to analysts? What specific aspects were they asked to evaluate in determining if an influence operation was present?

9. The paper focuses on agenda control and emotional language as indicators of influence operations. Could other linguistic or behavioral indicators be incorporated into the analysis? What data would need to be extracted from the messages or influencer actions?  

10. The paper states the approach could help identify early signs of potential influence operations. What additional monitoring or analysis over time could help track the evolution of operations and determine if initial suspicions are confirmed? What metrics could indicate if an operation is gaining momentum or traction?
