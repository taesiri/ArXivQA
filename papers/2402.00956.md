# [Exploring Spatial Schema Intuitions in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 excel at many NLP tasks but their lack of embodiment raises questions about whether they capture implicit human intuitions about spatial concepts that come from sensory-motor experience. 

- Image schemas are fundamental spatial building blocks of cognition learned early in life through physical interaction. They structure abstract thought and language (e.g. "feel down"). 

- Do LLMs encode people's spatial intuitions about the image schematic basis of words/phrases despite lacking grounded, embodied experience?

Method:
- Reproduce 3 psycho-linguistic experiments connecting language to spatial cognition using LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-4), vision-language models (GPT-4 Vision), and open-source models (LLaMA, IDEFICS).

- Compare model ratings/choices to human responses in experiments testing intuitions about:
   1) Image schemas underlying "stand" 
   2) Image schemas underlying "on"
   3) Directionality of verbs

- Evaluate using Spearman correlation between model and human responses.

Results:
- Moderate to high correlations in largest models' responses and humans' even without grounded experience.
- Smaller models and open-source models show lower correlations.  
- Differences remain: LLMs give more polarized ratings, don't compare relative ratings of phrases.
- Vision models show no/low correlations.

Contributions:
- First computational reproduction of experiments on spatial language cognition
- Evidence LLMs partially capture human spatial intuitions despite no direct embodiment
- Better understanding of relationship between language, spatial experience, and computations in LLMs

Limitations:
- Reliance on proprietary models with opaque mechanisms
- Training data may have included original papers
- Small historical sample sizes 

Impact:
- Environmental costs estimated
- Considerations for use of LLMs in cognition research


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores whether large language models, despite lacking embodiment, capture implicit human intuitions about fundamental spatial building blocks underlying language by reproducing three psycholinguistic experiments, finding moderate correlations between model outputs and human responses that reveal adaptability without tangible connections to embodied experiences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Using large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to reproduce three psycholinguistics experiments that connect language to humans' spatial intuitions. 

2) Finding that in many instances, the answers of the largest models and of human participants show moderate to strong correlations, even though the models' language use is not grounded in an embodied or enacted sense.

3) Identifying crucial differences compared to human answers, including polarized responses from LLMs (selecting either 1 or 7 on a scale) and reduced correlations for VLMs, especially for open-source models which show no correlations.  

In summary, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between language, spatial experiences, and the computations made by large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Image schemas - The paper focuses on exploring spatial schema intuitions and uses the concept of image schemas from cognitive linguistics as a foundation. Image schemas are pre-linguistic, perceptual building blocks of cognition learned early in development through bodily experiences.

- Embodiment - The paper examines the question of whether large language models capture implicit human intuitions about image schemas and spatial language even though they lack a direct connection between perception and action (embodiment).  

- Psycholinguistics experiments - The methodology involves reproducing three classic psycholinguistic experiments that connect language to spatial cognition in humans.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Various large neural network models trained on text are tested, including GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA.

- Vision language models (VLMs) - In one experiment, visual language models like GPT-4 Vision and IDEFICS are also tested.

- Correlations - The analysis examines the correlation between human responses and model outputs to determine if the models capture human spatial intuitions.

- Multimodality - One experiment uses textual, pseudo-visual, and visual conditions to explore the role of visual representations.

So in summary, key terms cover image schemas, embodiment, psycholinguistic experiments, large language models, vision models, correlations, and multimodality in the context of evaluating whether models capture human spatial language intuitions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using both closed and open-source language models in the experiments. What are some of the key challenges and limitations when using proprietary models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 compared to open-source models? How does this impact the generalizability of the findings?

2. The prompt engineering methodology involves optimizing the instructive sentences to maximize the fraction of valid model answers. What are some of the potential downsides of this approach? Could it introduce biases that affect the reliability of the correlations found between human and model responses?  

3. The paper compares text-only language models with vision-language models on an experiment that involves interpreting spatial configurations. What architectural and data differences between these types of models help explain why the vision-language models performed more poorly?

4. The methodology involves providing the models with only one stimulus-image schema pair at a time. How might this differ from how human participants approached rating multiple stimuli? Does this constrain the model's ability to provide relative ratings?

5. The original human experiments had a relatively small number of participants. How might running the experiments again with more human subjects change the benchmark that model outputs are compared against?

6. What role might the original human experiment papers have played in the training data for models like GPT-3 and GPT-4? Could this explain some of the correlations found between human and model ratings? How can this be controlled for?

7. The vision-language models are trained on natural images, yet had to interpret abstract line drawings in one experiment. What modifications could be made to improve vision-language models' architectural design and training methodology to better capture human spatial intuition?

8. The paper analyzes correlations between human and model ratings. What other metrics could be used to evaluate how well the models capture people's schematic intuitions? What are the limitations of using correlation as the evaluation metric?

9. How might the relative weighting of different data modalities (text, image, etc) in the training process of multimodal models like VLMs affect how well they learn mappings between visual perceptions and semantic representations?

10. The paper links language model capabilities to theories from embodied cognition. What behavioral or neurological experiments could provide additional evidence regarding these connections between spatial cognition, language, and model computations?
