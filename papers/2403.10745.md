# [iDb-RRT: Sampling-based Kinodynamic Motion Planning with Motion   Primitives and Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Kinodynamic motion planning involves finding feasible and collision-free trajectories for robotic systems while considering dynamics constraints. Methods like RRT can efficiently explore configuration spaces but struggle with dynamics constraints. On the other hand, trajectory optimization methods can incorporate dynamics but require a good initial guess and may fail to find a solution. The goal is to develop an efficient kinodynamic motion planner that leverages the strengths of both sampling-based planning and optimization.

Method - iDb-RRT:
The paper proposes a new algorithm called iDb-RRT that combines RRT exploration with motion primitives and trajectory optimization. The key ideas are:

1) Allow discontinuities between motion primitives during RRT tree expansion. This enables efficient exploration without strictly satisfying dynamics. 

2) Repair discontinuities via trajectory optimization to obtain a feasible trajectory.

3) Iteratively reduce discontinuity bound and increase motion primitives until a solution is found.

The RRT variant, called Db-RRT, connects precomputed short motion primitives that satisfy dynamics locally but may have discontinuities globally. The trajectory optimizer then attempts to stitch these primitives into a smooth, dynamically feasible trajectory. If it fails, the discontinuity bound is reduced and more motion primitives are added until a solution is found.

Contributions:
- Concept of allowing bounded discontinuity during tree expansion for efficient RRT exploration.
- Novel algorithm iDb-RRT that integrates discontinuity-bounded RRT and trajectory optimization. 
- Analysis showing iDb-RRT is probabilistically complete.
- Extensive evaluation on 30 problems with 8 dynamical systems demonstrating 10x speedups over state-of-the-art methods.

The key insight is that allowing discontinuities enables efficient exploration while trajectory optimization can repair discontinuities, combining the strengths of both approaches. iDb-RRT expands the scope of RRT-based methods to complex kinodynamic planning problems.
