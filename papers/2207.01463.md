# [Explicit Boundary Guided Semi-Push-Pull Contrastive Learning for   Supervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01463)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we effectively exploit a few known anomalies to train more discriminative anomaly detection (AD) models that can detect both the known anomalies and generalize well to unseen anomalies?

The key points are:

- Most existing AD methods are unsupervised and learn only from normal data. This may result in insufficient discriminability to detect anomalies. 

- A few anomalies are often available in real applications, but directly using them (like in supervised learning) may bias the model towards the seen anomalies.

- This paper proposes a novel approach called Boundary Guided Anomaly Detection (BGAD) to address both issues simultaneously.

- BGAD has two main components:

1) Explicit Boundary Generating: Find an explicit separating boundary relying only on the normal data distribution. This avoids bias from limited anomalies.

2) Boundary Guided Optimizing: Use the boundary to guide a novel semi-push-pull loss that enhances discriminability by pulling normals together and pushing anomalies away, while preventing overfitting to known anomalies.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed BGAD approach can effectively exploit few anomalies for training more discriminative AD models that detect both known and unseen anomalies.
