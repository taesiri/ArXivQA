# [Explicit Boundary Guided Semi-Push-Pull Contrastive Learning for   Supervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01463)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we effectively exploit a few known anomalies to train more discriminative anomaly detection (AD) models that can detect both the known anomalies and generalize well to unseen anomalies?

The key points are:

- Most existing AD methods are unsupervised and learn only from normal data. This may result in insufficient discriminability to detect anomalies. 

- A few anomalies are often available in real applications, but directly using them (like in supervised learning) may bias the model towards the seen anomalies.

- This paper proposes a novel approach called Boundary Guided Anomaly Detection (BGAD) to address both issues simultaneously.

- BGAD has two main components:

1) Explicit Boundary Generating: Find an explicit separating boundary relying only on the normal data distribution. This avoids bias from limited anomalies.

2) Boundary Guided Optimizing: Use the boundary to guide a novel semi-push-pull loss that enhances discriminability by pulling normals together and pushing anomalies away, while preventing overfitting to known anomalies.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that the proposed BGAD approach can effectively exploit few anomalies for training more discriminative AD models that detect both known and unseen anomalies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel supervised anomaly detection method called Boundary Guided Anomaly Detection (BGAD) to tackle two key issues in anomaly detection: insufficient discriminability of models trained only on normal data, and bias caused by using only a few known anomalies during training. 

2. A boundary guided semi-push-pull (BG-SPP) loss is proposed to exploit the few available anomalies more effectively. It uses an explicit separating boundary derived from just the normal data distribution to guide the optimization - pulling normal features towards this boundary while pushing anomalies away from it by a margin. This enhances discriminability while mitigating bias.

3. A method called RandAugment-based Pseudo Anomaly Generation (RPAG) is proposed to create more useful anomaly examples by randomly augmenting and pasting irregular patches from the existing anomalies onto normal images. This helps tackle the rarity of anomaly examples.

4. Experiments on multiple anomaly detection benchmarks like MVTecAD show state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior arts in supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection. The improved generalization capability to unseen anomalies is also demonstrated.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed boundary guided optimization strategy that can effectively exploit the few available anomalies while reducing bias. RPAG also helps by synthesizing more useful anomalies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BGAD for supervised anomaly detection.
