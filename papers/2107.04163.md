# [Towards Robust Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop an active feature acquisition (AFA) framework that is more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and can scale to problems with a large number of candidate features? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Grouping candidate features based on their informativeness will allow the AFA agent to effectively handle a large action space.2) A novel OOD detection algorithm tailored for partially observed data can help identify OOD inputs during the acquisition process. 3) Guiding the agent to acquire features informative for OOD detection will improve robustness.The authors propose techniques to address the large action space via feature grouping, enable OOD detection with partial observations, and provide rewards to encourage acquiring OOD-informative features. Experiments demonstrate these contributions lead to improved performance and robustness over strong baselines.In summary, the central research question is how to make AFA models more practical by improving their robustness to OOD data and ability to scale to real-world sized feature spaces. The key hypotheses relate to grouping features, detecting OOD with partial data, and guiding acquisitions via OOD-informative rewards.
