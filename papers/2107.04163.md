# [Towards Robust Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop an active feature acquisition (AFA) framework that is more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and can scale to problems with a large number of candidate features? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Grouping candidate features based on their informativeness will allow the AFA agent to effectively handle a large action space.2) A novel OOD detection algorithm tailored for partially observed data can help identify OOD inputs during the acquisition process. 3) Guiding the agent to acquire features informative for OOD detection will improve robustness.The authors propose techniques to address the large action space via feature grouping, enable OOD detection with partial observations, and provide rewards to encourage acquiring OOD-informative features. Experiments demonstrate these contributions lead to improved performance and robustness over strong baselines.In summary, the central research question is how to make AFA models more practical by improving their robustness to OOD data and ability to scale to real-world sized feature spaces. The key hypotheses relate to grouping features, detecting OOD with partial data, and guiding acquisitions via OOD-informative rewards.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a framework for robust active feature acquisition (AFA). The main contributions are:1. An action space grouping technique to reduce the action space dimension and enable AFA with a large number of candidate features. It clusters candidate features based on their mutual information with the target variable. 2. A novel out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithm for partially observed data along the acquisition trajectories. It extends a state-of-the-art OOD detection method called MSMA to handle arbitrary marginal distributions.3. Incorporating the OOD detector in the AFA framework to guide the agent to acquire features that are informative for both predicting the target variable and detecting OOD inputs.4. Experiments on several image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The framework achieves state-of-the-art AFA performance and significantly improves OOD detection compared to strong baselines.In summary, this paper advances AFA research by improving its scalability to handle large feature spaces and its robustness against out-of-distribution inputs. The proposed techniques help bridge the gap between AFA research and practical applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes techniques to advance active feature acquisition models by scaling them to handle large feature spaces and making them more robust to out-of-distribution inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on robust active feature acquisition compares to other research in active feature acquisition:- Scalability: The paper proposes using hierarchical reinforcement learning to handle large candidate feature sets. This makes the approach more scalable compared to prior AFA methods like greedy approaches or flat RL policies that struggle with large feature spaces. - Robustness: The paper focuses on making AFA robust to out-of-distribution inputs by incorporating an OOD detector tailored for partially observed data. This makes the AFA agent more robust compared to prior work.- General framework: The proposed framework with dynamics modeling, OOD detection, and RL agent provides a general approach to robust AFA. Prior work has focused more narrowly on just the RL policy or dynamics modeling. - Strong empirical results: The paper shows state-of-the-art performance on several AFA benchmarks compared to modified baselines. This demonstrates the empirical effectiveness of the proposed techniques.- Model-based RL: The framework builds on recent model-based RL advances for AFA using learned dynamics models. This contrasts with model-free RL approaches in prior AFA research.Overall, the key novelties are the hierarchical policy for scalability, OOD detection for robustness, and the integration of these ideas into a general AFA framework. The paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in active feature acquisition compared to prior work through its technical contributions and strong experimental results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:- Developing a tree-structured action space by further clustering the features inside each group into smaller groups. They leave this for future work in Section 3.1 when discussing the action space grouping technique.- Investigating alternative quantities beyond mutual information for clustering the candidate features, such as mutual information between pairs of features or a similarity metric combining mutual information and conditional entropy. They mention these briefly as possible alternatives in Section 3.1.- Evaluating whether a single unified score matching network for partially observed data performs better than separately trained models for each subset of features. They plan to investigate this in future work in Section 3.2 when introducing the partially observed OOD detection algorithm. - Incorporating a termination action into the robust AFA framework, instead of using a fixed acquisition budget. They discuss this briefly in Section 3.3 when describing the overall robust AFA framework.- Exploring whether an adversarially robust AFA model can be developed that is robust to adversaries modifying the unobserved features. They pose this as an open question in the conclusion in Section 4.In summary, the main future directions are around scaling up the action space grouping to be more hierarchical, investigating alternative ways to cluster the features, improving the OOD detection model, reincorporating early termination, and developing adversarial robustness for AFA models.
