# [Towards Robust Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop an active feature acquisition (AFA) framework that is more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and can scale to problems with a large number of candidate features? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Grouping candidate features based on their informativeness will allow the AFA agent to effectively handle a large action space.

2) A novel OOD detection algorithm tailored for partially observed data can help identify OOD inputs during the acquisition process. 

3) Guiding the agent to acquire features informative for OOD detection will improve robustness.

The authors propose techniques to address the large action space via feature grouping, enable OOD detection with partial observations, and provide rewards to encourage acquiring OOD-informative features. Experiments demonstrate these contributions lead to improved performance and robustness over strong baselines.

In summary, the central research question is how to make AFA models more practical by improving their robustness to OOD data and ability to scale to real-world sized feature spaces. The key hypotheses relate to grouping features, detecting OOD with partial data, and guiding acquisitions via OOD-informative rewards.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework for robust active feature acquisition (AFA). The main contributions are:

1. An action space grouping technique to reduce the action space dimension and enable AFA with a large number of candidate features. It clusters candidate features based on their mutual information with the target variable. 

2. A novel out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithm for partially observed data along the acquisition trajectories. It extends a state-of-the-art OOD detection method called MSMA to handle arbitrary marginal distributions.

3. Incorporating the OOD detector in the AFA framework to guide the agent to acquire features that are informative for both predicting the target variable and detecting OOD inputs.

4. Experiments on several image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The framework achieves state-of-the-art AFA performance and significantly improves OOD detection compared to strong baselines.

In summary, this paper advances AFA research by improving its scalability to handle large feature spaces and its robustness against out-of-distribution inputs. The proposed techniques help bridge the gap between AFA research and practical applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes techniques to advance active feature acquisition models by scaling them to handle large feature spaces and making them more robust to out-of-distribution inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on robust active feature acquisition compares to other research in active feature acquisition:

- Scalability: The paper proposes using hierarchical reinforcement learning to handle large candidate feature sets. This makes the approach more scalable compared to prior AFA methods like greedy approaches or flat RL policies that struggle with large feature spaces. 

- Robustness: The paper focuses on making AFA robust to out-of-distribution inputs by incorporating an OOD detector tailored for partially observed data. This makes the AFA agent more robust compared to prior work.

- General framework: The proposed framework with dynamics modeling, OOD detection, and RL agent provides a general approach to robust AFA. Prior work has focused more narrowly on just the RL policy or dynamics modeling. 

- Strong empirical results: The paper shows state-of-the-art performance on several AFA benchmarks compared to modified baselines. This demonstrates the empirical effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

- Model-based RL: The framework builds on recent model-based RL advances for AFA using learned dynamics models. This contrasts with model-free RL approaches in prior AFA research.

Overall, the key novelties are the hierarchical policy for scalability, OOD detection for robustness, and the integration of these ideas into a general AFA framework. The paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in active feature acquisition compared to prior work through its technical contributions and strong experimental results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:

- Developing a tree-structured action space by further clustering the features inside each group into smaller groups. They leave this for future work in Section 3.1 when discussing the action space grouping technique.

- Investigating alternative quantities beyond mutual information for clustering the candidate features, such as mutual information between pairs of features or a similarity metric combining mutual information and conditional entropy. They mention these briefly as possible alternatives in Section 3.1.

- Evaluating whether a single unified score matching network for partially observed data performs better than separately trained models for each subset of features. They plan to investigate this in future work in Section 3.2 when introducing the partially observed OOD detection algorithm. 

- Incorporating a termination action into the robust AFA framework, instead of using a fixed acquisition budget. They discuss this briefly in Section 3.3 when describing the overall robust AFA framework.

- Exploring whether an adversarially robust AFA model can be developed that is robust to adversaries modifying the unobserved features. They pose this as an open question in the conclusion in Section 4.

In summary, the main future directions are around scaling up the action space grouping to be more hierarchical, investigating alternative ways to cluster the features, improving the OOD detection model, reincorporating early termination, and developing adversarial robustness for AFA models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes several techniques to advance active feature acquisition (AFA) approaches for more practical use. First, it introduces a hierarchical acquisition policy to handle a large number of candidate features. Candidate features are clustered based on their relevance to the target variable. The policy then first selects the cluster and then selects a specific feature within that cluster in an autoregressive manner. Second, the paper develops a novel algorithm for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs using only a subset of acquired features at any time during the acquisition process. It extends a state-of-the-art OOD detection method based on density of states to handle partially observed data. Finally, the detection algorithm provides an auxiliary reward to encourage the agent to acquire features that are informative for OOD detection. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed techniques enable scaling to problems with more features while also improving robustness to OOD inputs compared to prior AFA methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for robust active feature acquisition (AFA). Current AFA models have difficulty scaling to problems with a large number of candidate features. They are also vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, since they only have access to a subset of features during the acquisition process. To address these issues, the authors first propose an action space grouping technique to cluster similar candidate features. This allows the AFA agent to efficiently select features from a large pool of candidates. They also develop a novel algorithm for detecting OOD inputs using only partially observed features. Specifically, they extend multi-scale score matching to arbitrary marginal distributions and use the norm of scores as summary statistics in a density of states framework. Furthermore, the OOD detector provides an auxiliary reward to guide the agent towards acquiring features that are informative for OOD detection. 

The proposed framework is evaluated on several image classification and reconstruction tasks. It significantly outperforms baselines in terms of classification accuracy, reconstruction error, and OOD detection AUROC. The action space grouping does not degrade performance compared to selecting from all candidates directly. The partially observed OOD detector also achieves competitive performance to methods operating on fully observed data. Examples demonstrate the agent can recognize the underlying class using only a small subset of features. The framework represents an important advance towards scaling up AFA models and improving their robustness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a framework for robust active feature acquisition (AFA). The key method components are:

- Action space grouping: Candidate features are clustered based on their mutual information with the target variable. This allows the agent to select features hierarchically in groups rather than individually from a large set. 

- Partially observed OOD detection: A score matching network is trained to output scores for arbitrary marginal distributions. The norm of scores on held-out data is used to fit a density model. At test time, the likelihood under this density model determines if a partially observed instance is OOD.

- Robust AFA agent: The agent selects features to acquire based on current observations. It is rewarded not just for predicting the target variable but also for acquiring features that increase the likelihood of the partial observation under the density model. This encourages acquiring "normal" looking instances to improve OOD detection.

In summary, the key innovation is developing a framework that scales AFA to problems with many features through action space grouping and that acquires features robustly by optimizing rewards from both a task model and an OOD detector. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main focus of this paper is on developing a robust active feature acquisition (AFA) framework that can handle a large number of candidate features and is robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. 

The key issues addressed are:

- Scaling up AFA to handle a large feature space. Current AFA models have difficulty dealing with a large number of candidate features. This limits their applicability in real-world settings where there may be a huge pool of potential features to select from.

- Making AFA robust to OOD inputs. Existing AFA models can be vulnerable to OOD data points since they are focused on acquiring features to predict a target variable and ignore whether the input itself is from the expected data distribution.

To address these issues, the paper proposes:

- A hierarchical policy to group candidate features and reduce the action space. This allows the AFA agent to scale to large feature spaces.

- A novel OOD detection method for partially observed data along acquisition trajectories. This allows robustness to OOD inputs using only the currently acquired features.

- Techniques to encourage the agent to acquire features useful for OOD detection. This improves robustness.

So in summary, the key focus is on scaling up AFA and making it robust to OOD inputs in order to move these techniques closer to practical real-world application.
