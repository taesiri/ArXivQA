# [Metrological detection of multipartite entanglement through dynamical   symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.0564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:How can multipartite entanglement in thermal equilibrium systems be detected through the system's dynamical symmetries rather than its conserved quantities?The key points are:- The paper provides a lower bound on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for thermal Gibbs states in terms of the system's dynamical symmetries - operators with periodic time dependence. - This lower bound can be saturated when considering a complete set of dynamical symmetries, allowing the QFI to be decomposed into contributions from different symmetry sectors.- The QFI detects metrologically useful multipartite entanglement. So bounding the QFI based on dynamical symmetries provides a way to detect entanglement from the system's dynamics.- Previously, bounds on response functions were formulated in terms of conserved quantities using the Mazur-Suzuki relations. This work generalizes that approach to dynamical symmetries.- The results provide a new perspective for detecting entanglement in equilibrium systems from their non-stationary dynamics, by checking if the dynamical symmetries are local or not.In summary, the key hypothesis is that multipartite entanglement in thermal states can be inferred from the system's dynamical symmetries rather than just its conserved quantities. The lower bound on the QFI supports this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main contributions are:- Derives a rigorous lower bound on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for thermal equilibrium systems in terms of dynamical symmetries rather than conserved quantities. The QFI detects metrologically useful multipartite entanglement. - Shows the lower bound can be saturated when considering a complete set of dynamical symmetries. This allows the QFI to be decomposed into terms corresponding to complete subsets of dynamical symmetries.- Relates the entanglement of thermal states, witnessed by the QFI, to the non-stationary dynamical properties and dynamical symmetries of the system. This provides a new perspective to detect multipartite entanglement in equilibrium systems.- Extends the results to bounds on other information measures like the QFI matrix, Wigner-Yanase skew information, and quantum variance.- Provides a lower bound on the QFI for thermal pure states satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in terms of dynamical symmetries.- Discusses applications to detecting entanglement and investigating non-equilibrium phenomena like many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and time crystals.In summary, the main contribution is rigorously connecting the multipartite entanglement structure to the dynamical symmetries and non-stationary dynamics of equilibrium systems. This provides new tools to detect entanglement and study ergodicity-breaking phenomena.
