# [PEaCE: A Chemistry-Oriented Dataset for Optical Character Recognition on   Scientific Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing OCR models and datasets tend to focus on either scientific text (e.g. math formulas) or generic printed English text. They do not work well on documents that contain both types of text, which is common in academic papers, especially in fields like chemistry. 

- Existing tools like Nougat cannot accurately parse tables from PubMed papers, which make up a significant portion of academic literature. Tables in PubMed are often presented as embedded images that cannot be parsed.

- There is no existing dataset containing both printed English and scientific text to train OCR models that can handle mixed documents. Simply combining existing datasets leads to inconsistencies and fails to capture interspersed scientific and plain text.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce PEaCE, a new OCR dataset containing 1M images of printed English text, 100k images of numerical artifacts, 100k images of pseudo-chemical equations, and 319 real images of text extracted from chemistry papers.

- Labels are in LaTeX format to handle non-alphanumeric characters in scientific text.

- Propose image transformations like pixelation, bolding and padding to mimic artifacts found in real scientific documents.

- Evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models trained on PEaCE with different patch sizes and multi-domain data. Also explore Pix2Tex, a ViT + CNN encoder model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel dataset bridging gap between models/data for vanilla printed English and scientific text OCR.

- Demonstrate models that perform well on existing datasets still struggle on real-world chemistry text, proving value of new dataset.  

- Show smaller ViT patch size yields better performance as it lowers information burden per patch.

- Multi-domain training boosts performance compared to single domain.

- Proposed image transformations improve real-world text parsing.

Overall the paper introduces a valuable new resource to train OCR models that can handle text from hard science documents, and provides analysis to guide future model development.
