# [True Knowledge Comes from Practice: Aligning LLMs with Embodied   Environments via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TWOSOME, a novel framework to efficiently align large language models (LLMs) with embodied environments via reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making tasks. 

Problem:
Despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs, they often fail at simple decision-making tasks due to two main misalignment issues - (1) generating invalid actions, and (2) inaccurate estimation of environment dynamics and constraints. In contrast, RL agents are always aligned with environments but suffer from poor sample efficiency due to lack of prior knowledge.

Solution: 
TWOSOME leverages the compositionality of LLMs to query action probabilities and form valid policies. It then optimizes the policies via proximal policy optimization (PPO) using environment rewards for alignment. Specifically:

1. It associates a semantic prompt to each valid action and uses LLM scores to compute joint action probabilities. This eliminates invalid actions.

2. It proposes token and word normalization techniques to handle the bias of LLMs assigning lower probabilities to longer action prompts. 

3. It designs a parameter-efficient architecture where a frozen LLM is updated via low-rank adapters, shared by the PPO actor and critic.

4. It summarizes principles for efficient prompt design to improve LLM reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- A general framework to interactively align LLMs with environments via RL without needing datasets or environment knowledge.

- Demonstrated superior sample efficiency over RL and better task completion over prompt tuning in Overcooked and VirtualHome environments.

- Strong generalization to unseen tasks leveraging LLM's open-vocabulary features.

- No significant loss in LLM capabilities after alignment, verified on NLP benchmarks.

The key insight is that by grounding the prior knowledge and language understanding abilities of LLMs through interactive RL alignment, the strengths of both can be combined - interpretability and validity of actions from LLMs and robust policy learning from RL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes TWOSOME, a general online framework to efficiently align large language models with embodied environments via reinforcement learning for decision-making tasks, without requiring prepared datasets or prior knowledge of the environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes TWOSOME, a general online framework to efficiently align large language models (LLMs) with embodied environments via reinforcement learning. The main contributions are:

1) A method to form valid behavior policies from LLMs by using the loglikelihood scores of tokens to calculate joint action probabilities. This eliminates the issue of LLMs generating invalid actions.

2) Two normalization techniques - token normalization and word normalization - to address the unbalance over the action distribution caused by longer action prompts having lower probabilities. Word normalization is shown to work best. 

3) A novel, parameter-efficient architecture where the actor and critic share a single frozen LLM with low-rank adapters that are updated via PPO. This allows efficient alignment of the LLM with environments.

4) Four principles for efficient prompt design to improve the initial policies generated by the LLM agents. 

5) Extensive experiments showing TWOSOME significantly outperforms baselines like PPO and SayCan in terms of sample efficiency, task performance, and generalization ability to unseen tasks, without losing the original capabilities of the LLM.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end framework called TWOSOME that can efficiently align LLMs with embodied environments via RL to solve decision-making tasks.
