# [The Hedgehog &amp; the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax   Mimicry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Linear attentions are promising for improving Transformer efficiency, reducing quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. However, existing linear attention mechanisms typically underperform standard softmax attention in modeling quality, with 4-6 worse perplexity.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper identifies two key properties that prior linear attentions lack compared to softmax attention: (1) Low-entropy "spiky" attention weights that selectively focus on relevant tokens and (2) Monotonicity over query-key dot products.

- The paper proposes "Hedgehog", a trainable linear attention mechanism designed to mimic the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention via cross-entropy distillation over the attention weights. Hedgehog uses simple MLPs as feature maps, trained to match softmax attention distributions.

Main Contributions:
- Hedgehog recovers 99% of standard Transformer quality across tasks in train-from-scratch, finetuned-conversion and pretrained-conversion settings.

- Hedgehog enables converting pretrained models like GPT-2 and Llama into efficient linear variants, achieving new SOTA results among subquadratic models.

- Analysis shows Hedgehog attention weights match softmax with higher fidelity than prior linear attentions. Hedgehog recovers the spiky and monotonic properties corresponding to performance gains.

In summary, Hedgehog closes the performance gap of linear attentions by learning to mimic the expressivity of standard softmax attention, enabling efficient linear Transformer variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention mechanism that trains feature maps to mimic the spiky and monotonic properties of standard softmax attention, enabling efficient yet high-quality Transformers for training from scratch, finetuned conversion, and pretrained conversion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is proposing "Hedgehog", a learnable linear attention mechanism trained to mimic the properties of standard softmax attention. Specifically:

- Hedgehog is designed to retain two key properties of softmax attention that the authors identify as important for performance: producing low-entropy "spiky" attention weights, and being monotonic with respect to query-key dot products. 

- Hedgehog uses simple MLPs as feature maps in the linear attention formulation. These MLPs are trained via a distillation loss to match the attention weights that would be produced by softmax attention.

- Experiments show that Hedgehog can recover 99% of the performance of standard Transformers in various settings: training from scratch, finetuned conversion of task-specific models, and conversion of pretrained models. This closes the performance gap compared to prior linear attention methods.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing an improved linear attention method that retains key properties of softmax attention and matches its performance across different Transformer training regimes, while maintaining the efficiency benefits of linear attention.

- Performance gap - Existing linear attentions underperform softmax attention in terms of modeling quality, with poorer perplexities. 

- Attention properties - The paper identifies two key properties that relate to the performance gap: (1) Low-entropy "spikiness" of attention weights (2) Monotonicity over query-key dot products.

- Hedgehog - The proposed learnable linear attention method, trained to mimic the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention via a distillation loss while maintaining efficiency.

- Experiments - Hedgehog is evaluated on tasks like LRA classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, GLUE, and on models like GPT-2 and Llama-2 across the three training regimes.

In summary, the key terms cover linear attentions, training regimes, performance gaps, attention properties, the Hedgehog method, and experimental evaluations. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) What motivated the authors to propose learning a trainable linear attention mechanism that mimics the properties of softmax attention? What issues were they trying to address?

2) The authors identify two key properties of softmax attention that are missing in prior linear attention mechanisms - low-entropy "spikiness" and dot-product monotonicity. Can you explain in detail why lacking these properties can hurt model performance?

3) The authors explore using low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the exponential function as a potential linear attention mechanism. What were the advantages and limitations they found with this approach? Why was it still not ideal?

4) Walk through the details of the proposed Hedgehog attention mechanism - the spiky MLP feature map and the attention weight distillation loss. What is the intuition behind each of these components? 

5) How exactly does the attention weight distillation loss allow Hedgehog to mimic the properties of softmax attention? Explain the mechanics of how this loss trains the feature maps.

6) What experiments did the authors conduct to validate that Hedgehog recovers the spiky and monotonic properties they identified? Summarize the key results.

7) For the three Transformer training regimes (train-from-scratch, finetuned conversion, pretrained conversion), explain how Hedgehog was evaluated and what performance improvements were demonstrated in each case.

8) Discuss the tradeoffs the authors identify between computation complexity, attention properties like spikiness/monotonicity, and model performance. How does Hedgehog balance these tradeoffs?

9) What differences did the authors observe between Hedgehog and prior methods like Transformer-to-RNN when applied to large pretrained models like Llama-2? What enabled better performance?

10) What opportunities do the authors identify for future work in transferring pretrained models to new tasks/longer contexts using Hedgehog? What methods could be combined with it?
