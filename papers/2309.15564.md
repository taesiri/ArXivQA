# [Jointly Training Large Autoregressive Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively combine large pretrained language models and text-to-image autoregressive models into a unified architecture capable of generating high-quality interleaved text and image outputs. 

Specifically, the key hypotheses are:

1) It is possible to seamlessly merge language models and text-to-image models into a single architecture while retaining the core capabilities of each parent model.

2) The combined model can be efficiently fine-tuned with a small amount of mixed-modal data to generate coherent and aligned multimodal responses using text instructions.

3) Instruction tuning strategies tailored for interleaved text-image generation are an effective way to adapt the pretrained models for this novel task. 

The overarching goal is to develop the first large-scale multimodal model explicitly designed and optimized for generating integrated text and image content in a conversational format. The paper explores methodologies to fuse together specialized text and image models in order to create an emergent capability for producing unified multimodal responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework for jointly training large autoregressive multimodal models. Specifically: 

- The paper proposes methods to systematically fuse existing pretrained text and image generation models into a unified architecture that retains the strengths of each individual model. This includes techniques like model merging, width concatenation, and cross-model fusion using bi-directional cross-attention.

- The paper introduces a specialized instruction tuning strategy tailored for mixed-modal generation tasks. This involves collecting a small and curated dataset of interleaved text and images to teach the model coherent text-image generation. 

- The end result is a multimodal model capable of generating long-form content with seamlessly interleaved text and images. This represents the first model explicitly designed and tuned for coherent multimodal generation.

- The methods are shown to be highly data-efficient, requiring less than 1% of the original pretraining data for the parent models. The model displays strong performance on text, image, and interleaved text-image generation.

In summary, the key contribution is developing modular frameworks to combine specialized text and image models into a unified architecture, along with tailored instruction tuning, to achieve a first-of-its-kind multimodal generative model. The proposed techniques enable blending state-of-the-art models with minimal additional pretraining.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a modular framework called Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) to fuse existing text and image generation models into a unified architecture for generating high-quality multimodal outputs, and introduces an instruction tuning strategy tailored for mixed-modal generation tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for jointly training large autoregressive multimodal models by fusing existing pretrained language and image generation models. Here are some key ways this work compares to other related research:

- Most prior work on multimodal language models focuses on connecting a language model to a visual encoder rather than fusing two generative models. For example, models like Flamingo, BLIP, and GLIDE use a frozen language model with visual features injected via cross-attention. This paper is unique in bidirectionally fusing two autoregressive decoders.

- Compared to other multimodal generation models like GILL and Grounding LLMs, this paper introduces a more systematic and modular framework for blending text and image models rather than just grounding an LLM. The cross-fusion approach allows deeper integration.

- While there has been some recent work on instruction tuning for multimodal models, it has focused on visual understanding rather than generation abilities. This paper pioneers instruction tuning tailored specifically for coherent interleaved image-text generation. 

- The scale of model fusion in this paper is unprecedented, involving multi-billion parameter models trained on trillions of tokens. Most prior multimodal fusion has been on much smaller models.

- The method is highly data efficient, using less than 1% of the original pretraining data. Other approaches for model fusion or instruction tuning typically require more data.

So in summary, this paper pushes the boundaries on systematically fusing large autoregressive text and image models for enhanced multimodal generation. The innovations in cross-modal architecture design and instruction tuning for this specific task help advance the state-of-the-art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Scaling up the model size and asymmetry: The authors suggest exploring scaling up the size of the models used, as well as asymmetrically applying the cross-fusion method to bridge models of varying sizes. This could allow for integrating even larger and more capable models.

- Increasing context length for conversations: The authors discuss extending the context length beyond the 4K tokens used, to enable generating longer multimodal documents and multi-turn conversations. This could better support real conversational interactions.

- Exploring different modalities: While the paper focuses on fusing text and image models, the approach could be extended to integrate other modalities like audio, video, etc. 

- Improving image quality: The authors note limitations around occasional lower quality or hallucinated images, suggesting improving the image generation capabilities of the underlying models.

- Testing on more complex tasks: Evaluation could involve more complex reasoning tasks and metrics beyond the image captioning perplexity used. This could better measure capabilities like coherence across modalities.

- Specializing models for different domains: While this explores open-domain generation, adapting the approach to specific domains could be beneficial.

- Enabling more abstract concept generation: The authors note limitations around generating images reflecting abstract concepts, suggesting improvements in grounding to enable representing more abstract ideas.

In summary, key future work revolves around scaling, improving image generation quality, testing on more complex tasks, supporting longer conversational contexts, expanding to new modalities and domains, and better capturing abstract concepts. Advances in these areas could significantly extend the capabilities demonstrated.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework, a modular approach for combining existing text and image generation models into a unified architecture. The authors take two pretrained transformer models - one for text generation (LLM) and one for image generation from text (CM3leon) - and systematically fuse them using techniques like weight averaging, width concatenation, and cross-attention. A key benefit is that both models use the same autoregressive decoder-only architecture, enabling deep integration. The combined model is further instruct-tuned using a small custom dataset with conversational text instructions and interleaved text-image training samples. This tuning teaches the model to generate seamless multimodal outputs with coherent text and images. Overall, the model demonstrates strong performance in generating high-quality, aligned image-text content. The work represents an important advance in building large multimodal autoregressive models capable of integrated text and image generation. The modular framework enables efficiently leveraging state-of-the-art text and image models using a highly data-efficient approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework, a novel method for combining large pretrained autoregressive models from different modalities into a unified architecture capable of multimodal generation. The authors leverage a text-only language model and a text-to-image model, both based on the decoder-only transformer, and systematically fuse them using techniques like weight averaging, width concatenation, and cross-attention. Their proposed JAM-Cross model with bidirectional cross-attention layers emerges as the most effective fusion approach. 

The paper also introduces a specialized instruction tuning methodology focused on teaching the model coherent interleaved image-text generation. Using a small but carefully curated dataset, the authors demonstrate rapid adaption and strong performance on free-form conversational responses with inline images reflecting the textual content. Key findings reveal the feasibility of unifying knowledge from diverse autoregressive models via model fusion, and the efficacy of compact instruction tuning for multimodal generative tasks. The end result is an unprecedented system that can produce high-quality, on-topic images interleaved with free-form text for a given prompt.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework, a modular approach for combining large pretrained autoregressive models specialized in text and image generation. The key method involves merging two decoder-only transformer models by parameter averaging, width concatenation, and cross-model attention. The authors pretrain an averaged model called JAM-Uniform on a mixture of text and image-text data. They also propose JAM-Width which doubles the hidden size and initializes new parameters from the two parent models. Their main method JAM-Cross inserts bidirectional cross-attention layers between the two models to enable seamless fusion. This combined model with 19B parameters outperforms the individual 7B models on text and image benchmarks. Finally, they use a small custom dataset for multimodal instruction tuning to teach the model to generate coherent interleaved text and images.
