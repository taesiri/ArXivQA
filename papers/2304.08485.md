# Visual Instruction Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the LaTeX code provided, this does not appear to be a full research paper. It seems to be a LaTeX template for formatting papers to be submitted to the NeurIPS 2023 conference. Some key things I noticed:- The document class specified is \texttt{neurips\_2023}, which is a custom LaTeX class for formatting NeurIPS conference submissions.- It loads common packages like \texttt{inputenc}, \texttt{fontenc}, \texttt{amsmath}, etc. that assist with text encoding, fonts, and math typesetting.- There are commands defined to format the paper title, author list, affiliations, and other front matter. - The \texttt{abstract} environment is used to delimit the paper abstract.- Common sections like \texttt{Introduction}, \texttt{Related Work}, \texttt{Experiments} are used but currently empty. - The \texttt{thebibliography} environment is specified to format the references/bibliography but no actual citations included yet.So in summary, this seems to be a template to format papers for NeurIPS 2023 submission rather than a full paper with a research question or hypothesis. The core research components like introduction, methods, results, and discussion have not yet been added. Once those sections are written, we'd be able to identify the specific research question and contributions. The current template only provides the formatting scaffolding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review of the paper, it appears the main contribution is developing an approach for visual instruction tuning of large multimodal models using machine-generated instruction-following data. Specifically:- The paper presents a method to convert image-text pairs into instruction-following examples by leveraging ChatGPT/GPT-4 to generate conversational, descriptive, and reasoning-based responses about images. This provides a way to create multimodal instruction-following data.- The authors use this generated data to train a large multimodal model called LLaVA by connecting a vision encoder (CLIP) with a language model (LLaMA) and fine-tuning them end-to-end. - Through instruction tuning on the generated data, LLaVA demonstrates improved capabilities in visual understanding and following instructions, achieving strong performance on a visual chatbot task and the Science QA benchmark.- The work is the first to explore extending the idea of instruction tuning, which has shown promise in NLP models, to the multimodal domain. It provides both a data generation pipeline and a model training framework for visual instruction tuning.- The paper opens up an interesting research direction in developing multimodal models that can effectively follow human instructions and intents across various visual tasks.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing and validating visual instruction tuning as an approach to improve multimodal models' instruction-following abilities using machine-generated data. The paper provides both methodology and empirical evidence demonstrating the promise of this idea.
