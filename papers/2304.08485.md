Once those sections are written, we'd be able to identify the specific research question and contributions. The current template only provides the formatting scaffolding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, it appears the main contribution is developing an approach for visual instruction tuning of large multimodal models using machine-generated instruction-following data. Specifically:

- The paper presents a method to convert image-text pairs into instruction-following examples by leveraging ChatGPT/GPT-4 to generate conversational, descriptive, and reasoning-based responses about images. This provides a way to create multimodal instruction-following data.

- The authors use this generated data to train a large multimodal model called LLaVA by connecting a vision encoder (CLIP) with a language model (LLaMA) and fine-tuning them end-to-end. 

- Through instruction tuning on the generated data, LLaVA demonstrates improved capabilities in visual understanding and following instructions, achieving strong performance on a visual chatbot task and the Science QA benchmark.

- The work is the first to explore extending the idea of instruction tuning, which has shown promise in NLP models, to the multimodal domain. It provides both a data generation pipeline and a model training framework for visual instruction tuning.

- The paper opens up an interesting research direction in developing multimodal models that can effectively follow human instructions and intents across various visual tasks.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing and validating visual instruction tuning as an approach to improve multimodal models' instruction-following abilities using machine-generated data. The paper provides both methodology and empirical evidence demonstrating the promise of this idea.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

1. Exploring different model architectures and representation learning methods for connecting vision and language modules. The authors used a simple linear projection in this work but note more sophisticated schemes like gated cross-attention could be beneficial. Architectures like SAM that provide object-level features may also be promising.

2. Scaling up the amount of pre-training and fine-tuning data. Using larger image-text datasets for pre-training could increase concept coverage, and generating more instruction-following examples from broader corpora could enhance the model's capabilities.

3. Connecting stronger vision models like SAM into the architecture. This could enable new capabilities compared to what multimodal GPT-4 currently has.

4. Studying prompt/demonstration tuning as an alternative method for adapting the model to downstream tasks. The authors suggest this could be more parameter efficient than fine-tuning.

5. Exploring different schemes for ensembling the model with language-only LLMs like having the LLM validate or choose between differing assistant outputs. The authors found this hugely beneficial for Science QA performance.

6. Developing more comprehensive evaluation protocols to systematically assess the model's instruction following abilities, using metrics beyond just downstream task accuracy.

7. Releasing model checkpoints, data, and code to continue advancing open research on instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs. The authors took steps on this but suggest continued open-sourcing of assets.

In summary, the key future directions are around scaling up data and models, exploring different model architectures and fusion techniques, improving evaluation, and open-sourcing more assets to advance research in this emerging area. The authors lay out an exciting research agenda for building stronger instruction-following visual agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents \shortname{}, the first attempt at visual instruction tuning of large multimodal models by generating multimodal instruction-following data using GPT-4. The key idea is to leverage language-only ChatGPT/GPT-4 to produce instruction-following data for images, bypassing the need for expensive human annotations. Three types of data are generated: conversations, detailed descriptions, and complex reasoning, resulting in a dataset of 158K samples. \shortname{} connects the visual encoder of CLIP and the language decoder of LLaMA, and is trained end-to-end on this generated data. When fine-tuned for conversational abilities, \shortname{} shows impressive zero-shot generalization and reasoning on unseen images. When fine-tuned on ScienceQA, combining \shortname{} and GPT-4 achieves 92.53\% accuracy, a new state-of-the-art. The generated data, codebase, and model are open-sourced to facilitate research towards building open-source general-purpose multimodal assistants.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an approach to generate multimodal instruction-following data using language-only large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. It proposes using existing image-text pair datasets and reformulating the data into a conversation format between a human and an AI assistant. The authors use two techniques to encode visual information for text-only language models - using image captions and object bounding boxes. The generated instruction-following data includes three types of responses - conversational Q&A, detailed image descriptions, and responses requiring complex reasoning. 

The authors then develop a large multimodal model called LLaVA by connecting the visual encoder of CLIP with the LLaMA language model decoder. They pre-train LLaVA using filtered Conceptual Captions data to align the visual and text embeddings. The model is then fine-tuned on the generated instruction-following data to develop a multimodal chatbot assistant. Experiments show LLaVA can understand and reason about images to follow instructions. When fine-tuned on Science QA, LLaVA combined with GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.53\%. The work demonstrates the promise of generated data for instruction-tuning multimodal models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my understanding, the main method used in the paper involves leveraging a large language model like GPT-4 to generate multimodal language-image instruction-following data. Specifically, the authors prompt GPT-4 with symbolic representations of images such as captions and bounding boxes to generate conversational responses, detailed descriptions, and complex reasoning as instruction-following examples for a given image. 

The generated instruction-following data is then used to train a large multimodal model called LLaVA by connecting a CLIP vision encoder with the LLaMA language model. LLaVA is first pre-trained to align the image and text representations. Then it is fine-tuned end-to-end on the instruction-following data to predict assistant's responses conditioned on the image input and human instructions. Evaluations on synthetic instruction-following data and the ScienceQA dataset demonstrate LLaVA's capability in following instructions involving visual content and reasoning.

In summary, the core method is using a language model like GPT-4 to automatically create multimodal instruction-following data, which is then leveraged to train the LLaVA model to follow visual instructions by tuning the vision and language components in an end-to-end fashion.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper appears to address the challenge of developing generalizable instruction-following agents that can complete real-world tasks aligned with human intent. Specifically, the paper focuses on building large multimodal models that can effectively follow visual and language instructions to complete visual tasks. 

The key issues and gaps the paper seems to identify include:

- Existing works in computer vision have focused on developing instruction-following agents for specific isolated tasks like navigation or image editing. There is a need for more generalizable end-to-end trained models that can follow instructions across diverse real-world visual tasks. 

- Language representations have not been sufficiently utilized in vision models to capture task instructions and human intent. Vision models typically have fixed interfaces and limited interactivity/adaptability to user instructions.

- There is a lack of suitable multimodal data that provides language instructions paired with visual inputs, which can teach models to follow instructions. Most existing datasets are simply image-caption pairs.

- Large language models have shown promise in instruction-following, but this idea has been less explored for multimodal models dealing with vision and language.

To address these issues, the paper proposes instruction tuning of large multimodal models using machine-generated instruction-following data. Specifically, the contributions include:

- A method to convert image-text data into instruction-following examples using GPT-4 prompts.

- Development of a large multimodal model combining language and vision encoders, trained end-to-end on the generated instructional data.

- Experiments showing strong instruction-following and visual reasoning capabilities of the developed model.

In summary, the key research question is how to develop generalizable multimodal agents that can effectively follow human instructions and intents to complete visual tasks. This paper explores instruction tuning of LMMs as a promising approach.
