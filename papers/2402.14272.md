# [Qsnail: A Questionnaire Dataset for Sequential Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Questionnaires are an important research tool for gathering human opinions and behaviors, but designing high-quality questionnaires is difficult and time-consuming. 
- Automatic questionnaire generation is challenging due to the intricate constraints related to the questions, options, and overall structure. 
- There has been limited prior work on this task, primarily due to the lack of suitable datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce Qsnail, the first dataset specifically for questionnaire generation, comprising 13,168 human-written questionnaires with 184,854 question-option pairs across 11 domains.
- They utilize ChatGPT to reconstruct the research intents for each questionnaire based on the questions. 
- They conduct comprehensive experiments with retrieval, generative, and large language models on Qsnail and propose tailored automatic and human evaluation metrics.

Key Findings:
- Retrieval models often show deviations from the research topic and intents, while traditional generative models struggle with coherence.  
- Large language models demonstrate high relevance but lag in diversity, specificity, rationality and order compared to humans.
- Additional prompts and finetuning provide some improvements but still fall short of human performance.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizing questionnaire generation as a novel sequential question generation task and analyzing its challenges
- Introducing the first dedicated dataset Qsnail to catalyze research into this problem
- Establishing benchmark performance through extensive experiments with various models
- Demonstrating that questionnaire generation remains a challenging open problem needing further investigation

In summary, the paper introduces and analyzes the task of automatic questionnaire generation, provides the new Qsnail dataset, evaluates various models, and shows the limitations of existing methods, motivating more research into this complex generative task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Qsnail, the first dataset for automatic questionnaire generation, reveals the challenges of this task even for large language models, and calls for further research to focus on creating high-quality, professional questionnaires.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Formalizing the questionnaire generation as a sequential question generation task and pointing out its challenges compared to traditional question generation tasks. 

2. Proposing a new questionnaire generation dataset, Qsnail, to involve more researchers to focus on this problem. Qsnail contains 13,168 high-quality human-written questionnaires with research topics, intents, and 184,854 question-option pairs across 11 domains.

3. Conducting comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of retrieval models, traditional generative models, and large language models on the questionnaire generation task using both automatic metrics and human evaluations. 

4. Exploring two approaches - the outline-first prompt and model fine-tuning - to improve the performance of models on this task. The results show improvements but also reveal that questionnaire generation remains a challenging problem needing further investigation.

So in summary, the main contributions are formalizing this new task, constructing a dataset for it, benchmarking various models, and analyzing the remaining challenges. The paper aims to bring more attention to the questionnaire generation problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Questionnaire generation: The main task focused on in the paper, involving automatically generating questionnaires from a given research topic and intents.

- Sequential question generation: Questionnaire generation is framed as a form of sequential question generation, with a series of interconnected questions. 

- Constraints: The paper emphasizes the intricate constraints in questionnaires related to individual questions, options, and overall structure.

- Qsnail dataset: A new dataset introduced in the paper containing over 13,000 human-written questionnaires to benchmark questionnaire generation models. 

- Evaluation metrics: Both automatic metrics (e.g. Rouge-L, BLEU) and human evaluations are proposed to assess questionnaire quality from different perspectives.

- Language models: Various models are examined, including retrieval models, generative models like GPT-2, and large language models such as ChatGPT, Vicuna, and ChatGLM.

- Prompt engineering: Approaches like outline-first prompting and model fine-tuning are explored to enhance questionnaire generation performance.

- Future work: The paper concludes by underscoring the challenges in this task and the need for further investigation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called Qsnail for questionnaire generation. What were the key steps involved in creating this dataset, especially for reconstructing the research intents? How was the quality of the reconstructed intents ensured?

2. The paper points out intricate constraints in questionnaire generation related to questions, options and overall structure. Can you elaborate on 2-3 key constraints in each of these aspects that make this task challenging? 

3. The paper explores an outline-first prompt method to improve questionnaire generation. How exactly does this method work? Why does it significantly improve performance for ChatGPT but not for other models like Vicuna-7B and ChatGLM-6B?

4. The paper finds that retrieval models like BM25 have limitations in relevance to research topics/intents. What causes this limitation? How can it be potentially addressed? 

5. The paper shows that traditional generative models like GPT-2 struggle to produce coherent, usable questionnaires even after finetuning. What are 2-3 major reasons behind this?

6. While LLMs perform well in relevance, the paper finds they still lag behind humans significantly in aspects like diversity and specificity. Why do you think this gap exists despite extensive pretraining of LLMs?

7. The paper introduces some novel automatic evaluation metrics for questionnaire generation quality e.g. Rep-n, Rep-sem etc. Can you explain the rationale behind 2 of these metrics and how they capture key aspects of quality?

8. For human evaluation, metrics like order, background and acceptance rate are introduced. Why are these important to assess overall questionnaire quality? How are they measured?

9. The paper finds that finetuning models like ChatGLM-6B leads to improvements but finetuning Vicuna-7B causes deteriorations. What factors may explain this difference in impact of finetuning?

10. What are 2-3 promising future directions that can help advance the state-of-the-art in questionnaire generation based on the findings and remaining challenges highlighted in this paper?
