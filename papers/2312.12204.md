# [Enhanced Unscented Kalman Filter-Based SLAM in Dynamic Environments:   Euclidean Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper addresses the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in dynamic environments using filter-based approaches, specifically the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Conventional SLAM algorithms, including UKF-SLAM, assume a static environment and struggle with moving landmarks, which reduces localization accuracy. 

The main contribution is a new UKF-SLAM algorithm that can identify and eliminate moving landmarks. It uses Euclidean distance measurements between the robot and landmarks across time steps to detect motion. If the measured and predicted distances differ significantly, the landmark is classified as moving and excluded from the state vector.  

The proposed approach is simple, computationally efficient, and requires no prior environment knowledge. It outperforms conventional UKF-SLAM in simulations across metrics like accuracy and robustness to noise under varying numbers of landmarks, waypoints and moving landmarks. The ability to ignore moving landmarks focuses computations on reliable stationary references, enhancing estimation.

The paper also contributes a novel simulation framework and dataset tailored to benchmarking SLAM methods in dynamic settings. Experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superiority over conventional UKF-SLAM. Additionally, a realistic simulation replicates robot mapping in an indoor environment with a moving object, assessing practical applicability.

In conclusion, leveraging filter-based UKF principles coupled with selective landmark exclusion constitutes an effective SLAM technique for dynamic real-world environments. The proposed innovations advance the accuracy and robustness of SLAM systems in non-static settings.
