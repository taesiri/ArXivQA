# [New asymptotically flat static vacuum metrics with near Euclidean   boundary data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.0082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main goal is to prove existence and local uniqueness results for asymptotically flat static vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations, with prescribed Bartnik boundary data on the boundary hypersurface. 

Specifically, the paper aims to establish sufficient conditions on the boundary hypersurface geometry, called "static regularity", under which the existence and local uniqueness hold. The authors further show that large classes of hypersurfaces satisfy the static regularity condition.

The Bartnik boundary data refers to prescribing the induced metric and mean curvature on the boundary. The static vacuum condition means the metric has a timelike Killing field and zero Ricci curvature. 

The main theorems confirm the existence and local uniqueness for Bartnik boundary data near that induced from the Euclidean metric on certain generalized foliations (Theorem 7) and on simply-connected hypersurfaces with data prescribed away from any open subset (Theorem 6 and Corollary 8).

In summary, the central hypothesis is that static regularity of the boundary is a sufficient condition for solving the boundary value problem. The main results provide evidence for this by verifying static regularity for large classes of hypersurfaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- It improves prior results on the existence of static vacuum extensions with prescribed Bartnik boundary data near Euclidean space. Specifically, it generalizes an earlier perturbation result (Theorem 7 in the authors' prior work) to allow for more general families of deforming hypersurfaces. 

- It establishes a new "uniqueness" result (Theorem 3) showing that solutions to the linearized problem must be trivial (arise from infinitesimal diffeomorphisms) if certain localized boundary data on a subset of the boundary vanish.

- As applications, it shows existence and local uniqueness of static vacuum extensions for a broader class of boundary data on simply-connected hypersurfaces, allowing the data to be arbitrarily prescribed away from any open subset.

- The key new ingredients are some arguments and techniques motivated by the authors' separate work on the conjecture for data near an arbitrary static vacuum metric. These include an extension result for "h-Killing" fields and calculations using boundary integrals.

In summary, this note strengthens the evidence for the static extension conjecture and provides new techniques and results on the structure of solutions, building on the authors' prior analytical framework. The localized boundary data result seems particularly interesting as a uniqueness theorem. Overall, it represents an incremental but meaningful advance on an important open problem.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of asymptotically flat, static vacuum spacetimes:

- The paper focuses on Bartnik's static extension conjecture, which posits the existence and uniqueness of an asymptotically flat static vacuum extension given certain boundary data. This conjecture has been an open problem in mathematical relativity since it was proposed by Robert Bartnik in 2002. As such, research directly aimed at resolving or providing evidence for this conjecture is fairly limited. 

- The authors build on their own prior work which introduced a novel sufficient condition ("static regular") for the existence portion of Bartnik's conjecture. Their prior work also confirmed this condition for large classes of boundary data. 

- This new paper further expands the types of boundary data known to be "static regular" using some new arguments. In particular, it shows the condition holds for hypersurfaces in an open and dense subfamily of certain general one-sided families of hypersurfaces.  

- Compared to the handful of other positive results toward Bartnik's conjecture, this work seems broader in the type of boundary data covered. Prior results focused only on data sufficiently close to round spheres or perturbations thereof. The new "one-sided family" result appears more general.

- The techniques involve a mix of PDE and geometric analysis. The new arguments involving "localized" boundary data are interesting and may find future use in related problems at the interface of analysis and geometry.

- Overall, this paper makes incremental but meaningful progress on an important open problem through novel techniques. If the static extension conjecture is resolved, this work would likely be viewed as part of the foundation toward the full resolution.

In summary, this paper makes valuable progress on Bartnik's longstanding conjecture, complementing and expanding on earlier work by the authors and others. The new arguments and expansion of "static regular" boundary data types are noteworthy contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reading the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further exploring the existence and uniqueness of static vacuum extensions for more general classes of boundary data beyond those considered in this paper. The authors have shown existence and uniqueness for boundary data close to Euclidean space, but it remains open for more varied boundary geometries.

- Classifying when the static extension conjecture may fail, such as for certain types of inner-embedded hypersurfaces discussed in the introduction. The authors reference work conjecturing such surfaces could provide counter-examples. 

- Using the framework and results developed here to help prove or disprove the original static extension conjecture in full generality. While progress has been made for specialized cases, the general conjecture remains open.

- Connecting the existence theory developed here to the problem of isometric embedding of hypersurfaces into a static vacuum manifold. The authors suggest this could have links to recent work on quasi-local mass definitions using such embeddings.

- Exploring whether the characterization of "static regular" boundary hypersurfaces could be further generalized. For instance, Theorem 7 generalizes from foliations to certain one-sided families.

- Applying the existence theory to construct new examples of asymptotically flat static vacuum metrics beyond known exact solutions. This could help elucidate the broader structure of such metrics.

- Extending the local uniqueness results to a more global theory. The current uniqueness results are local in nature.

In summary, the authors point to a range of open problems related to static vacuum extensions, the original Bartnik conjecture, and connections to isometric embedding and quasi-local mass problems as fruitful future research directions stemming from this work. Advancing our understanding of any of these problems would mark important progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the problem of constructing new asymptotically flat static vacuum metrics that satisfy prescribed boundary data, as posed in Robert Bartnik's static extension conjecture. The authors establish a sufficient condition called "static regular" for the existence and local uniqueness of such metrics close to Euclidean space with perturbed boundary hypersurfaces. They show that hypersurfaces in open dense subsets of certain general smooth one-sided families are static regular, improving upon prior results requiring smooth generalized foliations. The proofs involve establishing a uniqueness result for localized boundary data and using new arguments motivated by recent work on the conjecture for boundary data near an arbitrary static vacuum metric. Overall, the paper makes progress on Bartnik's longstanding conjecture by confirming it for large new classes of perturbed hypersurfaces in Euclidean space.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper establishes new existence results for static vacuum extensions with prescribed boundary data near Euclidean space. The static vacuum condition arises in general relativity to model an isolated gravitational system. The main open problem, proposed by Robert Bartnik, is whether for any compact Riemannian manifold with boundary satisfying certain geometric conditions, there exists a unique asymptotically flat static vacuum extension matching the prescribed boundary data. 

This paper makes progress on Bartnik's conjecture by improving prior results of the authors. They introduce a sufficient condition called "static regular" for the boundary hypersurface, and show that a dense subset of hypersurfaces in certain general families are static regular. This implies existence and local uniqueness of static vacuum extensions for boundary data near induced Euclidean data on those hypersurfaces. The proofs involve new arguments for analyzing localized boundary data and vector field extensions. Overall, the results enlarge the class of boundary data for which Bartnik's conjecture is confirmed. The techniques developed will likely lead to further understanding of the space of asymptotically flat static vacuum metrics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper establishes the existence of new asymptotically flat static vacuum metrics with near Euclidean boundary data. The key method is proving that certain boundary hypersurfaces are "static regular", which is shown to be a sufficient condition for the existence and local uniqueness of a static vacuum extension. The authors prove that hypersurfaces in an open and dense subfamily of a general smooth one-sided family of hypersurfaces are static regular, generalizing their prior work on perturbed hypersurfaces forming a foliation. The proof relies on showing the solutions to the linearized problem must arise from infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, using a unique continuation argument for vector fields that are locally Killing with respect to a symmetric 2-tensor. This allows them to deduce the linearized second fundamental form must vanish on the whole boundary based on it vanishing on a subset, which is used to establish static regularity.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents new results on the existence of asymptotically flat, static vacuum metrics with prescribed Bartnik boundary data near an arbitrary static vacuum metric, using new arguments involving localized boundary conditions and perturbation techniques for certain one-sided families of hypersurfaces.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of existence and uniqueness of static vacuum extensions of Bartnik boundary data. Specifically, it is concerned with the case where the Bartnik boundary data is near Euclidean boundary data induced on hypersurfaces in Euclidean space.

The key background and context is Bartnik's static extension conjecture, which poses the problem of whether given a compact Riemannian manifold (Ω,g0) with nonnegative scalar curvature and mean curvature H_g0 positive somewhere on the boundary Σ, there exists a unique asymptotically flat static vacuum manifold (M,g) that extends (Ω,g0) and matches the induced metric and mean curvature on Σ. 

This paper builds on the authors' prior work establishing the notion of "static regular" as a sufficient condition for the local existence and uniqueness of such static vacuum extensions. The main new results are:

- Showing that any hypersurface in an open and dense subfamily of a general smooth one-sided family of hypersurfaces is static regular. This generalizes a prior result that established static regularity for open dense subsets of smooth generalized foliations.

- A "triviality" theorem showing solutions of the linearized problem must arise from infinitesimal diffeomorphisms if they have zero Cauchy data on a subset of the boundary satisfying a topological condition.

- As a corollary, they obtain existence and uniqueness of static vacuum extensions for boundary data arbitrarily close to Euclidean, except on any given nonempty open subset of a simply connected hypersurface boundary.

So in summary, this paper makes progress on the static extension conjecture by establishing static regularity and hence local existence/uniqueness for broader classes of geometries of the boundary hypersurface.
