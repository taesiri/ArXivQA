# [New asymptotically flat static vacuum metrics with near Euclidean   boundary data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.0082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main goal is to prove existence and local uniqueness results for asymptotically flat static vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations, with prescribed Bartnik boundary data on the boundary hypersurface. Specifically, the paper aims to establish sufficient conditions on the boundary hypersurface geometry, called "static regularity", under which the existence and local uniqueness hold. The authors further show that large classes of hypersurfaces satisfy the static regularity condition.The Bartnik boundary data refers to prescribing the induced metric and mean curvature on the boundary. The static vacuum condition means the metric has a timelike Killing field and zero Ricci curvature. The main theorems confirm the existence and local uniqueness for Bartnik boundary data near that induced from the Euclidean metric on certain generalized foliations (Theorem 7) and on simply-connected hypersurfaces with data prescribed away from any open subset (Theorem 6 and Corollary 8).In summary, the central hypothesis is that static regularity of the boundary is a sufficient condition for solving the boundary value problem. The main results provide evidence for this by verifying static regularity for large classes of hypersurfaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It improves prior results on the existence of static vacuum extensions with prescribed Bartnik boundary data near Euclidean space. Specifically, it generalizes an earlier perturbation result (Theorem 7 in the authors' prior work) to allow for more general families of deforming hypersurfaces. - It establishes a new "uniqueness" result (Theorem 3) showing that solutions to the linearized problem must be trivial (arise from infinitesimal diffeomorphisms) if certain localized boundary data on a subset of the boundary vanish.- As applications, it shows existence and local uniqueness of static vacuum extensions for a broader class of boundary data on simply-connected hypersurfaces, allowing the data to be arbitrarily prescribed away from any open subset.- The key new ingredients are some arguments and techniques motivated by the authors' separate work on the conjecture for data near an arbitrary static vacuum metric. These include an extension result for "h-Killing" fields and calculations using boundary integrals.In summary, this note strengthens the evidence for the static extension conjecture and provides new techniques and results on the structure of solutions, building on the authors' prior analytical framework. The localized boundary data result seems particularly interesting as a uniqueness theorem. Overall, it represents an incremental but meaningful advance on an important open problem.
