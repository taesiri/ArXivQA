# [Investigating Markers and Drivers of Gender Bias in Machine Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Gender bias in language models and machine translations is a known issue, but difficult to study as models may use heuristics to mask underlying biases. 
- Prior work has made questionable assumptions in interpreting pronoun usage as indicators of bias. 
- There is a need for more nuanced, generalized, and reproducible approaches to investigate gender bias in translations.

Method: 
- Use back-translation through 5 "genderless" languages in DeepL API to elicit implied gender. 
- Propose adjusted unalikeability coefficient (UCA) as metric for variation in repeated translations of sentences.
- Compare UCA over languages and for sentence features like main verb.
- Establish reproducibility over 3 time-separated datasets.

Key Findings:
1) Languages fall into groups with distinct pronoun usage patterns, highlighting need for multi-language analysis.  
2) Singular "they" is rare in translations, suggesting models lag current usage. Propose avoiding over-interpretation of any one pronoun.
3) Verb is a significant driver of variation in pronoun choice.
4) Despite API behavior change over time, UCA metric proves robust while raw pronoun counts do not.

Main Contributions:
- First study to use 5 languages to compare implied gender in translations.
- Introduce UCA metric to quantify uncertainty in pronoun choice while avoiding biased assumptions.  
- Show verb is a higher-order driver of uncertainty.
- Demonstrate reproducibility of back-translation method.

The paper makes a case that the back-translation approach has promise for further probing and understanding gender bias in language models, if analysis avoids questionable interpretations and seeks more generalized patterns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates gender bias in machine translation models by back-translating sentences through genderless languages and proposes a new metric to quantify uncertainty in implied gender based on variation of pronouns appearing in repeated translations of the same sentence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Extending the back-translation approach to investigating gender bias in machine translation from 1 language (in previous work) to 5 languages, showing the need to use multiple languages to get more generalizable results. 

2) Proposing a new metric (adjusted unalikeability coefficient) to quantify variation in gender implied by pronoun choices in repeated translations of the same sentence. This avoids over-interpreting any individual pronoun as evidence of bias.

3) Finding evidence that the main verb in a sentence drives the variation in implied gender on translation, suggesting higher-order patterns in the data that require further analysis. 

4) Demonstrating consistency of results using the proposed metric across 3 time-separated datasets for Finnish translations, despite an observed change in the behavior of the DeepL API, showing the reproducibility of the back-translation method overall.

In summary, the main contributions are in expanding the back-translation approach, proposing a new variability metric, identifying the verb as a factor affecting variability, and establishing reproducibility, to further develop this technique for investigating gender bias in machine translation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- back-translation
- machine translation 
- large language model
- gender bias
- pronoun selection
- variation metric
- unalikeability coefficient (UCA)
- intermediate language
- Finnish, Estonian, Turkish, Indonesian, Hungarian
- verb as driver of bias
- reproducibility

The paper investigates gender bias in machine translation models by using a back-translation technique through several "genderless" intermediate languages. It proposes a new metric called the adjusted unalikeability coefficient (UCA) to quantify uncertainty/variation in gender implied by pronoun selection. The authors also find evidence that the main verb in a sentence drives the level of gender variation. Comparisons are made between translations via five different languages, and reproducibility over time is examined for Finnish. So the key concepts relate to studying and quantifying gender bias in machine translation via back-translation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called the adjusted unalikeability coefficient (UCA) to quantify variation in pronoun selection during back-translation. How is this metric calculated and what are its advantages over simply counting pronouns like "he" and "she"? 

2. The paper finds that the languages used for back-translation fall into three loose groupings based on their pronoun profiles. What are these three groupings and what characterizes the pronoun usage within each group?

3. The paper argues against over-interpreting the appearance of specific pronouns like "he" in back-translations. What is the rationale behind this? How does the proposed UCA metric avoid making assumptions about particular pronouns indicating bias?

4. The results suggest that the main verb in a sentence is a significant driver of variation in pronoun selection during back-translation. How was this conclusion reached? What statistical tests were conducted to demonstrate this relationship?  

5. While the paper focuses on a dataset of 56 sentences from software engineering, it suggests the approach could be generalized to other domains. How could the back-translation method and analysis be adapted for texts from other fields?

6. The paper finds a notable change over time in the behavior of the DeepL translation API with regards to rendering the pronoun "she." How did this affect analysis of reproducibility? Why did the UCA metric remain robust?

7. What are some ways, suggested in the Future Work section, that the back-translation method could be expanded upon? For example, using longer source texts, balancing sentences by verb, or inverting the context.  

8. The paper categorizes the back-translation approach as exploratory research. What threats to validity remain that would need to be addressed in making firmer conclusions or testing specific hypotheses in future studies?

9. The conclusion states that language models may simply reflect societal biases accurately. Could the back-translation method shed light on whether models over-represent certain biases beyond what occurs in real-world language? 

10. How could the implications of this research be applied to analyzing gender bias in machine translations intended for public consumption? What steps remain to make the method suitable for auditing production systems?
