## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large foundation models like GPT-4 still have major competency gaps for multimodal biomedical applications like generating radiology reports from images.  
- Issues with privacy, cost, latency, and compliance make it hard to directly use large private models in clinical settings.
- There is a need for open-source small multimodal models that can attain strong performance on biomedical tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop LLaVA-Rad, a small multimodal model for radiology report generation from chest X-rays. 
- Use a modular approach with pre-trained vision and language models, focusing training on a lightweight adapter to align modalities.
- Assemble a large dataset of over 1 million image-text pairs for pretraining the image encoder. Use GPT-4 to process texts.  
- Propose G-Rad, a GPT-4 based evaluation method to assess factual correctness.
- Conduct ablations on model variations to establish best practices.

Main Contributions:
- LLaVA-Rad sets new SOTA benchmarks for radiology report generation tasks, outperforming much larger models like GPT-4V and Med-PaLM.
- Fast to train (2 days on 1M pairs) and can run on a single GPU, facilitating clinical fine-tuning. 
- G-Rad is shown to align better with expert radiologist evaluation compared to prior automatic metrics.
- Systematic ablation study provides insights and best practices for efficient biomedical multimodal learning.
- Attention analysis shows LLaVA-Rad can ground image regions to output words.

In summary, the paper develops an open-source small multimodal model that bridges competency gaps in large models and demonstrates its effectiveness for radiology report generation from images. The clinical viability is shown via strong performance, efficient training and deployment, and rigorous evaluation.
