# [Read to Play (R2-Play): Decision Transformer with Multimodal Game   Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing a generalist agent capable of performing well on a diverse set of tasks is a major challenge in AI. Recent works have shown promise by using large offline datasets or integrating textual/visual guidance. However, relying solely on textual guidance lacks visual grounding while deriving effective strategies from visual trajectories alone is difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes enhancing task guidance for agents via "multimodal game instructions" to provide rich contextual information. Specifically, they construct a dataset of multimodal game instructions for Atari games, consisting of gameplay descriptions, 20-step visual trajectories, and annotated actions/element positions. 

- They integrate these multimodal game instructions into the Decision Transformer (DT) model. The instructions are encoded and fed to a hypernetwork module in DT that generates adapter parameters weighted by an estimated instruction importance score. This allows providing tailored guidance to DT for different games.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of a multimodal game instruction dataset for Atari games containing language descriptions, visual trajectories, and detailed action annotations.

- Introduction of a Decision Transformer with Game Instructions (DTGI) model that integrates multimodal instructions via a hypernetwork adapter module, enabling knowledge sharing across games.

- Experiments showing DTGI significantly improves upon DT and unimodal guidance baselines in multitasking over 37 Atari games. DTGI also generalizes substantially better to 10 unseen games.

- Analysis indicating multimodal game guidance is more informative than text or trajectories alone. Increasing games in training rather than dataset size improves out-of-distribution performance. Weighting instructions by importance score enhances results.

In summary, this paper explores enhanced task guidance for improving agent generalization, constructing a multimodal instruction dataset and integrating it effectively into Decision Transformers via a novel hypernetwork design. The presented DTGI model achieves new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Atari domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes integrating multimodal game instructions, comprising textual guidance and visual trajectories, into decision transformers to enhance their multitasking and generalization capabilities in Reinforcement Learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors construct a set of Multimodal Game Instructions (MGI) to provide rich contextual guidance for reinforcement learning agents playing Atari games. Each MGI contains a game description, 20-step trajectory images, and textual guidance corresponding to each image. The MGIs are designed to simulate an agent's ability to understand gameplay instructions in order to adapt to new games. 

The authors also propose a Decision Transformer model augmented with these Multimodal Game Instructions (DTGI). The DTGI model learns to leverage the MGI guidance by generating adapter parameters conditioned on the MGI content. This allows it to integrate the multimodal contextual information into its decision-making process.

Experiments demonstrate that incorporating the MGI into the Decision Transformer leads to substantial improvements in both multitasking performance over 37 training games, and generalization to 10 unseen games. The multimodal guidance is also shown to be more effective than textual or visual guidance alone.

In summary, the key contribution is the Multimodal Game Instruction framework for providing rich guidance to RL agents, along with the DTGI model that effectively utilizes this multimodal guidance to enhance multitasking and generalization capabilities.
