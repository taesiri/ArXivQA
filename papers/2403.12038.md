# [Zero-Shot Image Feature Consensus with Deep Functional Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent large-scale vision models trained for generative and discriminative tasks have shown the emergence of dense correspondence capabilities. However, these models struggle to retain the global structure of the correspondences, leading to distortions and discontinuities. Existing methods attempt to address this by integrating features from different layers and networks, but they only indirectly tackle the lack of structure. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using functional maps, a concept from computer graphics, to impose structure on the correspondence field. Specifically:

1) Two distinct pixel-wise feature extraction networks are used to obtain two sets of features from the input images. 

2) One set of features is used to compute the Laplacian eigenfunctions that serve as the basis. The other set is used as a geometric regularizer.

3) A functional map is optimized that establishes a mapping between the function spaces of the two images. This mapping aligns one basis with the other feature set.  

4) A refinement network from partial functional maps is incorporated to handle occlusions and shape variations.

5) Additional regularizations like compactness and consistency are enforced.

This allows lifting the correspondence problem from the pixel space to the functional space where a coherent global structure can be imposed.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel framework to derive correspondences from pre-trained features by optimizing a functional map between function spaces instead of direct pixel-level matches.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard dense correspondence datasets, with smoother and more globally coherent mappings.

- Demonstrates effectiveness on other tasks like keypoint matching and affordance map transfer.

- Provides analysis on choice of features and layers, and shows integrating distinct layers enhances generalization without additional fine-tuning.

- Sets strong baseline for extracting visual knowledge from large-scale models, with the potential to uncover more of their correspondence capabilities.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of functional maps to uncover and enhance correspondence properties of visual features, by optimizing in the functional rather than pixel space. This simple but effective technique advances the state-of-the-art while providing insight into emergent behaviors of large vision models.
