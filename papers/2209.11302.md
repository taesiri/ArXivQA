# [ProgPrompt: Generating Situated Robot Task Plans using Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11302)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can large language models be leveraged to generate executable robot task plans in a situated environment, given only a high-level natural language instruction? 

The key hypothesis is that by structuring the prompts to the LLMs using programming language constructs, the models can be guided to produce plans that are executable on a given robot in a given environment. Specifically, the prompts provide the LLM with:

- Import statements to specify available actions
- Object lists to specify available entities 
- Example tasks as executable programs  
- Assertions and feedback for situated awareness

By prompting the LLM in this programming-inspired way, the hypothesis is that the model can generate plans that are compatible with the robot's capabilities and executable in the current environment, without needing any additional domain or planning knowledge.

So in summary, the central research question is how to get LLMs to generate executable and situated robot plans just from a high-level instruction, and the key hypothesis is that a programming-language prompt structure can enable this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a programmatic prompt structure for large language models (LLMs) that enables generating executable robot task plans directly from high-level natural language instructions. The key ideas are:

- Representing robot plans as Python-style program functions, with imports, comments, assertions for state feedback. This allows leveraging LLMs' understanding of code.

- Constructing prompts that provide the LLM information about available actions, objects, and example tasks in the environment. This enables generating plans tailored to the current situation.

- Using programming constructs like imports and assertions to constrain the LLM's outputs to valid actions and objects. This results in executable plans. 

- Showing that adding natural language comments to explain plan steps further improves success.

- Demonstrating the approach succeeds in household tasks in a virtual environment and on a real robot, generalizing across scenes, agents, and tasks.

Overall, the prompts encode both natural language and programming structure to elicit situated and executable plans from LLMs. The key insight is prompting the LLM with environment/action specifics so it can output plans compatible with the current context.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents ProgPrompt, a method that uses programming language-style prompts to elicit knowledge from large language models to generate executable robot task plans for situated environments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on using large language models for robot task planning:

- The main novelty is the structured prompt design that incorporates programming constructs like imports, lists of objects, function definitions with assertions, and natural language comments. This allows the model to generate directly executable plans conditioned on the environment state and available actions, unlike prior work that required post-processing text outputs.

- Compared to concurrent work like Socratic Models, this paper explores additional prompt features like comments and assertions that improve performance. The ablation studies provide concrete recommendations on prompt engineering. 

- For evaluation, the paper demonstrates strong quantitative results on a simulated household environment compared to prior work, and provides a real robot demonstration. Many prior methods only evaluate in simulation.

- The prompting approach makes minimal assumptions about the robot platform or capabilities. By just changing the imported action functions, the method can generalize to different robots. This flexibility is a nice advantage over methods relying on action enums or dynamics models.

- Limitations compared to more classical planning methods include reliance on large external LLMs, lack of guarantees on plan optimality, and difficulty formally verifying generated plans. The blackbox nature of LLMs makes errors hard to debug.

- Future work could explore techniques like recursive prompt expansion when generation is cut off prematurely, integrating numeric quantities in prompts, and addressing common failure modes identified in the analysis.

Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in terms of prompt engineering for task planning, strong quantitative simulation results, and flexible generalization to new robots. The intuitive programming-inspired prompting approach seems promising for utilizing strengths of LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring broader use of programming language features in prompts, such as real-valued numbers to represent measurements, nested dictionaries to represent scene graphs, and more complex control flow constructs. The authors note that LLMs have shown capability for arithmetic and understanding numbers in NLP tasks, but their ability for complex robot behavior generation is still relatively unexplored.

- Studying how to make ProgPrompt more flexible and generalizable by communicating environment-specific information (e.g. object affordances, complex environment interactions) explicitly as part of the prompt. Many current failures stem from ProgPrompt being agnostic to peculiarities of the deployed environment. 

- Incorporating more reliable action success feedback during plan execution, to handle cases where subsequent actions may fail due to earlier unnoticed failures. The assertion recovery modules help currently, but don't cover all possibilities.

- Addressing incompleteness in generated plans, potentially by querying the LLM again with the partial plan to encourage coherent, non-repetitive continuation.

- Developing methods to automatically evaluate complex open-ended tasks with multiple valid solutions, rather than relying on a single predetermined goal state. This could involve enumerating valid possibilities or human verification.

- Exploring physical robot experimentation more extensively, as a qualitative demonstration so far. The real world's randomness complicates quantitative comparison.

In summary, the authors suggest enhancements to ProgPrompt's programming language features, environment modeling, execution robustness, evaluation flexibility, and physical system testing as interesting future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents ProgPrompt, a method for generating executable robot task plans using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to structure the prompt to the LLM like a Python program, specifying available actions as import statements, available objects as a list, and example tasks as Python functions. This allows the LLM to generate a complete executable plan program for a given natural language instruction. The prompts also include assertions to check pre-conditions and comments to provide natural language guidance, improving the coherence and situational awareness of the generated plans. Experiments in simulation and on a physical robot demonstrate that ProgPrompt can successfully generate plans that are executable in the given environment across a variety of household tasks, outperforming prior methods that don't incorporate programming structure into the prompt. ProgPrompt provides an intuitive and flexible way to leverage both the commonsense and code understanding abilities of LLMs for situated robot task planning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces ProgPrompt, a method for generating robot task plans using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to structure the prompt for the LLM like a Python program, specifying available actions as imports, available objects as a list, and example tasks as executable functions. This allows the LLM to generate a full pythonic program that can be directly executed to accomplish a given task. The prompts also include natural language comments to guide reasoning and assertions to incorporate state feedback. Experiments in a virtual household environment show ProgPrompt outperforms prior methods, especially when using programming features like comments and assertions. The method also works well on a physical robot, producing executable plans for tabletop tasks. 

ProgPrompt demonstrates how programming language structure can help focus LLMs on generating feasible, executable robot plans. By formatting the prompt as imports, object lists, example functions, etc. the LLM is constrained to output only valid actions on available objects. The natural language components like comments provide commonsense guidance. The results show ProgPrompt plans have much higher actionability and goal achievement than prior natural language prompting techniques. The method also extends easily to new environments and robots by modifying the prompt. Overall, ProgPrompt provides an effective way to leverage LLMs for situated robot task planning.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key problem this paper is addressing is how to effectively leverage large language models (LLMs) for robot task planning in real-world, situated environments. Specifically, the challenges are:

- LLMs excel at commonsense reasoning but lack explicit knowledge about the objects, actions, and capabilities available in a particular robotic system and environment.

- Existing methods that use LLMs for planning either require enumerating all possible actions or generate freeform text that may not map cleanly to executable robot actions. 

- LLMs need to be provided with state feedback and environment context to generate feasible, executable plans.

To address these issues, the paper introduces ProgPrompt, a prompting scheme that represents robot plans as Python-style programs and incorporates programming constructs like imports, object lists, assertions, and comments to make the LLM outputs directly executable while still leveraging commonsense reasoning. The key insight is prompting the LLM with structured program-like specifications of available actions and environment state.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of effectively grounding the commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs into executable robotic plans through a programmatic prompting approach designed for situated task planning.
