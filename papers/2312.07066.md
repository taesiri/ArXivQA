# [DiffuVST: Narrating Fictional Scenes with Global-History-Guided   Denoising Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07066)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel visual storytelling framework called DiffuVst that utilizes diffusion models to generate coherent narratives for sequences of fictional images. Unlike traditional autoregressive models, DiffuVst models the narration process as a single conditional denoising task over latent embeddings and can generate full stories simultaneously in a non-autoregressive manner, leading to significantly faster inference. The model incorporates multimodal encoders to extract adapted image and text features across all panels, which provide global visual and textual history to enhance coherence. A transformer network is trained to denoise representations of the ground-truth story conditioned on these global features. Experiments on four fictional visual story datasets show DiffuVst outperforms strong autoregressive baselines in both text quality and inference efficiency. The results validate the effectiveness of leveraging diffusion models and non-autoregressive generation for the emerging need to narrate non-real-world visual content.
