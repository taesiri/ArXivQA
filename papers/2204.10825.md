# Meet Your Favorite Character: Open-domain Chatbot Mimicking Fictional   Characters with only a Few Utterances

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we build open-domain conversation models that mimic fictional characters, when only a few example utterances of those characters are available?The key points are:- The paper considers mimicking fictional characters as a promising direction for building more engaging conversational agents. - Previous approaches like persona-based models or style-controlling models are not suitable, as fictional characters cannot be easily defined with just a few descriptions, and there is insufficient dialog data available for most characters.- The paper proposes a new practical task where the goal is to mimic a character's style using only a few sample utterances of that character.- They introduce a method called Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) which leverages large pre-trained language models and builds prompts containing the character's utterances in a dialog format.- PDP matches each utterance to a pseudo-context using a retrieval model, since only isolated utterances are available. - Experiments show PDP can produce responses that better reflect a character's style compared to baselines, even with just a small number of example utterances.In summary, the main hypothesis is that constructing prompts in a dialog format with pseudo-contexts can help language models mimic fictional characters in open-domain conversation, even when very limited data for those characters is available. The paper aims to demonstrate this approach with the proposed PDP method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) to generate responses that mimic fictional characters, using only a few example utterances of the character. Specifically, the key ideas are:- They introduce a new practical task of mimicking fictional characters using just a few utterances, which is more feasible than requiring full dialogs or extensive persona descriptions of the characters. - PDP builds prompts in a dialog format, with the character's example utterances treated as dialog history. This helps better reflect the character's style compared to simply concatenating the utterances.- Since only utterances are available, PDP uses a retriever to match each utterance to a pseudo-context from a candidate set. This allows building context-utterance pairs to form the dialog prompt.- Experiments show PDP can generate more character-mimicking responses than baseline methods, demonstrated through human evaluation and automated metrics.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the PDP method to address the new task of mimicking characters with limited data, by creatively formatting prompts as pseudo-dialogs using retrieved contexts. The results validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) to mimic fictional characters in open-domain conversations by leveraging large language models, where PDP builds prompts in a dialog format using a few example utterances of the target character along with pseudo-contexts retrieved for each utterance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in dialogue systems and style transfer for conversational agents:- The paper introduces a new practical task of mimicking fictional characters with only a few example utterances. This is a novel task setting not explored in prior work. Most prior work assumes access to large dialogue datasets or corpora of text in the target style.- The proposed Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) method is simple and straightforward, yet effective for the proposed task. It leverages pre-trained language models in a prompt-based approach, unlike prior work that requires re-training or fine-tuning complex models.- For evaluation, the paper presents both human and automatic evaluations focused on style strength and dialogue coherence. This provides a comprehensive assessment. Most prior work evaluates either style transfer or dialogue quality, but not both. - Experiments compare to strong baselines like personalized dialogue and style transfer models. The consistent improvements from PDP demonstrate its effectiveness for mimicking style with limited data.- The method generalizes well to other style transfer tasks beyond fictional characters, like controlling for sentiment and emotion. This shows it is broadly applicable.In summary, the paper makes contributions in defining a practical new task, proposing a simple but effective prompt-based method, and conducting rigorous evaluation. The generalizability is also notable. Comparisons to related work are fair and it clearly advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource style transfer for dialogue.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Investigating methods to improve the coherence of generated responses while preserving character style. The authors note there is a trade-off between style reflection and response coherence, and suggest exploring ways to generate coherent responses that still strongly exhibit the character's style. - Analyzing why the simple Random Match baseline performs well at reflecting character style. The authors plan to study why this simple method of selecting random pseudo-contexts works surprisingly well.- Using more complex context retrieval methods to find pseudo-contexts that are more relevant to the character utterances. The authors suggest this could further enhance the style reflection while maintaining coherence.- Extending the work to capture more intrinsic characteristics of characters rather than just lexical/stylistic habits. The authors note that given only a few utterances, capturing inherent traits is very challenging, but suggest it as an interesting direction.- Applying the method to control styles other than fictional characters, such as sentiment, emotion and writing style. The authors show promising results on these tasks and suggest further exploration.- Investigating why the Gold Match benchmark does not perform as well as expected. The authors plan to study the reasons behind this to better understand the model's internal mechanisms.So in summary, the main suggested future directions are improving coherence while preserving style, analyzing surprising model behaviors, using more advanced retrieval techniques, capturing deeper character traits, expanding to other style control tasks, and better understanding model limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new task and method for training open-domain conversational agents to mimic fictional characters using only a few example utterances from each character. The key challenges are that fictional characters can't easily be defined using concise persona descriptions, and there is insufficient dialog data available for most characters. To address this, the authors propose Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP), which converts the few character utterances into pseudo dialog history by retrieving relevant context sentences from a large corpus. These pseudo dialogs are used to prompt a pretrained language model to generate responses in the character's style. Experiments using the HLA-Chat dataset show PDP can produce more character-consistent responses than baselines, as measured by human evaluation and a character classifier. Overall, this work demonstrates a practical approach to mimicking characters in open-domain chatbots using limited data.
