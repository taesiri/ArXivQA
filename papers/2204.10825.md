# Meet Your Favorite Character: Open-domain Chatbot Mimicking Fictional   Characters with only a Few Utterances

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we build open-domain conversation models that mimic fictional characters, when only a few example utterances of those characters are available?The key points are:- The paper considers mimicking fictional characters as a promising direction for building more engaging conversational agents. - Previous approaches like persona-based models or style-controlling models are not suitable, as fictional characters cannot be easily defined with just a few descriptions, and there is insufficient dialog data available for most characters.- The paper proposes a new practical task where the goal is to mimic a character's style using only a few sample utterances of that character.- They introduce a method called Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) which leverages large pre-trained language models and builds prompts containing the character's utterances in a dialog format.- PDP matches each utterance to a pseudo-context using a retrieval model, since only isolated utterances are available. - Experiments show PDP can produce responses that better reflect a character's style compared to baselines, even with just a small number of example utterances.In summary, the main hypothesis is that constructing prompts in a dialog format with pseudo-contexts can help language models mimic fictional characters in open-domain conversation, even when very limited data for those characters is available. The paper aims to demonstrate this approach with the proposed PDP method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) to generate responses that mimic fictional characters, using only a few example utterances of the character. Specifically, the key ideas are:- They introduce a new practical task of mimicking fictional characters using just a few utterances, which is more feasible than requiring full dialogs or extensive persona descriptions of the characters. - PDP builds prompts in a dialog format, with the character's example utterances treated as dialog history. This helps better reflect the character's style compared to simply concatenating the utterances.- Since only utterances are available, PDP uses a retriever to match each utterance to a pseudo-context from a candidate set. This allows building context-utterance pairs to form the dialog prompt.- Experiments show PDP can generate more character-mimicking responses than baseline methods, demonstrated through human evaluation and automated metrics.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the PDP method to address the new task of mimicking characters with limited data, by creatively formatting prompts as pseudo-dialogs using retrieved contexts. The results validate the effectiveness of this approach.
