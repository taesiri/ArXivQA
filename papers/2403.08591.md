# [ActionDiffusion: An Action-aware Diffusion Model for Procedure Planning   in Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Procedure planning in instructional videos is challenging due to the complex and unstructured nature of human demonstrations in videos. Existing methods fail to exploit the rich temporal dependencies between actions in the sequences. They treat action sequences statically without considering that actions tend to cause particular follow-up actions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ActionDiffusion (AD), a novel diffusion model that incorporates temporal action dependencies directly into the diffusion process for procedure planning. Specifically, AD projects action information into the noise space by:

1) Adding action embeddings into the noise masks during the noise adding phase, such that at each timestep the noise mask contains information about previous actions. 

2) Introducing an attention mechanism in the denoising network to enable learning correlations between actions when predicting the action-aware noise.

Main Contributions:

1) First method to incorporate temporal action dependencies directly into a diffusion model for procedure planning through action-aware noise masks.

2) Achieves state-of-the-art results on CrossTask, Coin and NIV datasets across multiple metrics and time horizons by explicitly modeling dependencies between actions.

3) Demonstrates that adding action embeddings into the noise masks enables the diffusion model to better learn temporal action dynamics, increasing performance on procedure planning from complex instructional videos.

In summary, AD is the first diffusion model for procedure planning that effectively encodes temporal dependencies between actions through novel action-aware noise masks and attention in the denoising network. It sets the new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.
