# [Improving Retrieval for RAG based Question Answering Models on Financial   Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with domain-specific tasks due to limitations in their training data. This is problematic for areas like finance where accuracy is critical. 
- Standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have limitations that lead to suboptimal text retrieval. This impacts the overall performance of LLMs that rely on the retrieved text.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores methods to improve RAG pipelines for financial documents to address limitations around chunking strategies, similarity search, reasoning, and metadata.
- Techniques covered include recursive chunking, hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE), metadata annotations, re-ranking algorithms, and domain-specific embedding fine-tuning.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies key weaknesses in current RAG systems when applied to complex domain documents
- Proposes both general strategies and financial document-specific techniques to enhance retrieval 
- Covers methods to evaluate retrieval quality through metrics like context relevance and answer faithfulness
- Provides framework to assess end-to-end performance improvement of LLM with enhanced RAG pipeline
- Discusses areas for further work like knowledge graphs and user-guided embedding tuning

In summary, the paper offers a comprehensive overview of RAG limitations and impactful techniques to optimize retrieval quality for financial documents. This allows downstream LLMs to generate more accurate, relevant and faithful responses to domain-specific queries.
