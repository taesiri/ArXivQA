# [Align-to-Distill: Trainable Attention Alignment for Knowledge   Distillation in Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Align-to-Distill: Trainable Attention Alignment for Knowledge Distillation in Neural Machine Translation":

Problem:
- Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, improving efficiency. 
- KD for Transformer models often relies on heuristics to decide which teacher layers to transfer knowledge from. This becomes intractable as the number of layers grows.
- Previous feature-based KD methods have struggled to effectively distill the decoder in sequence generation tasks like neural machine translation (NMT).

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel KD method called "Align-to-Distill" (A2D) with an Attention Alignment Module (AAM) that aligns student attention heads with teacher counterparts.
- AAM performs dense comparisons between student and teacher attention heads across layers using pointwise convolution. 
- This turns the heuristic feature mapping problem into a learnable alignment.
- Loss function includes cross-entropy loss, attention transfer loss between AAM and teacher attention, and standard KD loss.

Main Contributions:
- A2D provides an end-to-end trainable attention alignment solution without needing heuristics.
- Removes constraints on model architecture parity between teacher and student.
- Enables fine-grained attention transfer which makes A2D effective for decoder distillation in NMT.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art KD techniques on both high-resource and low-resource translation tasks. 
- Analysis shows A2D attention connections are more evenly distributed in the decoder, benefiting decoder distillation.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative attention alignment approach for knowledge distillation that achieves superior performance by overcoming limitations of prior arts. The trainable attention mapping is broadly applicable yet uniquely impactful for decoder distillation.
