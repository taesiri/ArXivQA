# [Transferable Candidate Proposal with Bounded Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04604)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Active learning algorithms select an informative subset from unlabeled data to query labels from an oracle. However, recent works show that the selected subset (active set) does not maintain utility when transferred to different model architectures or settings.
- Existing experimental designs assume universal informativeness of data subsets, which is unrealistic as data informativeness changes across model configurations.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new "Candidate Proposal" experimental design to verify transferability of active learning. 
- A proxy model constrains a pool of potentially transferable data candidates. Target models then select an informative subset from these candidates using active learning algorithms.
- Propose TBU (Transferable candidate proposal with Bounded Uncertainty) algorithm to filter non-transferable candidates. TBU removes data with low epistemic uncertainty (LE instances) and high aleatoric uncertainty (HA instances).

Main Contributions:
- First work on verifying transferability of Candidate Proposal framework in active learning.
- TBU algorithm that uses uncertainty estimation to constrain transferable data candidates for active learning.
- Experiments on CIFAR and SVHN datasets show TBU improves performance of active learning algorithms when transferred across model architectures and settings.
- Analysis shows TBU provides difficulty scheduling by adaptive filtering of LE and HA instances over active learning cycles.

In summary, the paper introduces a new experimental design and selection algorithm to improve transferability of active learning across varying model configurations. The TBU algorithm is shown to enhance existing active learning methods.
