# [Multi-Query Focused Disaster Summarization via Instruction-Based   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Automatic summarization of disaster events from multiple online information sources like social media is critical for emergency response, but poses challenges due to the rapid pace of content creation and heterogeneity of sources. The CrisisFACTS track aims to advance multi-stream disaster summarization through a shared task.

Proposed Solution: The authors propose a system with two components - a two-stage retrieval module to extract relevant documents for a given query, and a summarization module to generate query-focused facts from the retrieved documents which are concatenated into event nuggets. 

The retrieval module first uses BM25 to retrieve an initial set of documents, which are reranked by a MonoT5 model fine-tuned for passage ranking. The top 30 reranked documents are passed to the summarizer.

The summarizer uses the LLaMA instruction-following language model. It is prompted in a question-answering style to output bullet point facts relevant to the query, along with source document citations. Facts are concatenated within a length limit into event nuggets, scored by averaging relevance scores of cited documents.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that a simple prompting approach with large language models can surpass extractive baselines and other CrisisFACTS systems in both automatic and human evaluation.
- Provides insights into using freely available LLMs for disaster summarization.
- Quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals limitations of the approach related to prompting, fact correctness, redundancy etc.

The results highlight the potential as well as current gaps for LLMs in this complex summarization task. Interesting future work includes analyzing prompting strategies and handling entity surface form issues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a system for disaster event summarization that combines a two-stage retrieval pipeline with BM25 and MonoT5 for selecting relevant documents and an instruction-following summarization method using the LLaMA language model, achieving competitive performance compared to other systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a system for multi-query focused disaster event summarization using instruction-based prompting of a large language model (LLM). Specifically, the paper:

- Proposes a pipeline consisting of a two-stage document retrieval module followed by an LLM-based summarization module. The retrieval module uses BM25 and MonoT5 to select relevant documents, while the summarization module uses prompting and the LLaMA LLM to generate query-focused summary facts.

- Evaluates the approach on the CrisisFACTS 2023 shared task dataset, achieving strong performance compared to baselines and other systems based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation. 

- Provides an analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the instruction-based prompting approach for disaster summarization. While the simplicity of prompting is beneficial, issues like lack of query-relevant facts and incorrect/incomplete citations highlight areas for improvement.

So in summary, the main contribution is an effective prompting-based LLM summarization approach for multi-query focused disaster summarization, along with an empirical analysis of its capabilities on a standard dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage retrieval approach consisting of a sparse retriever and a neural reranker model. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using only a single retriever model?

2. The paper uses the MonoT5 model for document reranking. What are the key properties and architectural details of this model? Why was it selected over other neural ranking models?

3. The paper generates event nuggets using the LLaMA instruction-following model. What is the training methodology and architecture used by LLaMA models? Why was the LLaMA model chosen for this task?

4. The prompting strategy uses a question answering format to generate facts from documents. What are the benefits of framing the task this way compared to more traditional summarization techniques? How does it help with extracting query-relevant facts?

5. The qualitative analysis revealed issues with the relevance of retrieved documents and incorrect/incomplete facts generated by the model. What techniques could be used to improve the reliability and accuracy of the pipeline?

6. Redundancy due to entity surface form issues was identified in the analysis. How can this problem be mitigated at different stages of the pipeline e.g. during retrieval, reranking, or summarization?

7. The paper compares against extractive baselines using integer linear programming. What are the key differences between extractive and neural abstractive techniques for disaster summarization? When is one approach generally preferred over the other? 

8. The human evaluation results significantly outperformed automatic ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. Why is this and how can automatic evaluation be improved for a complex summarization task like disaster response?

9. What incremental improvements could be made to the prompting strategy and LLaMA model to reduce hallucinations and formatting errors identified in the qualitative analysis?

10. How suitable is the proposed approach for a real-time disaster response scenario? What practical deployment considerations need to be accounted for?
