## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "OmniGS: Omnidirectional Gaussian Splatting for Fast Radiance Field Reconstruction using Omnidirectional Images":

Problem: 
Existing photorealistic reconstruction methods using neural radiance fields (NeRF) with omnidirectional images suffer from long training and inference times due to the computational intensity of radiance field sampling. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly accelerates the rendering process for perspective images, the current splatting algorithm is incompatible with omnidirectional image rendering.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes OmniGS, a novel omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast radiance field reconstruction from omnidirectional images. The key contributions are:

1. Theoretical analysis of derivatives of the spherical camera model in 3D Gaussian splatting, providing mathematical foundation for accurate omnidirectional rendering. 

2. New GPU-accelerated omnidirectional rasterizer that directly splats 3D Gaussians onto equirectangular screen space without cube-map rectification or tangent-plane approximation. Enables efficient and differentiable optimization of radiance field.

3. Complete reconstruction pipeline to optimize position, color, rotation, scale and opacity of 3D Gaussians by minimizing photometric loss between rendered and ground truth omnidirectional images.

4. State-of-the-art reconstruction quality and over 100 FPS rendering speed on 360Roam and EgoNeRF datasets, using less training time than baselines.

5. Ability to render high-quality perspective novel views by cropping rendered omnidirectional images, outperforming original 3DGS trained on perspective images.

Main Contributions:
1. Introduction of thoughtful theoretical analysis to enable direct screen-space splatting for real-time and differentiable omnidirectional rendering.

2. Development of OmniGS system with new GPU-accelerated omnidirectional rasterizer, achieving fast and high-fidelity reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

3. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrating SOTA performance in terms of quality and speed compared to NeRF-based baselines.

In summary, OmniGS pushes state-of-the-art in photorealistic mapping using omnidirectional images by proposing novel theoretical foundations and technical contributions for efficient optimization and rendering of omnidirectional radiance fields.
