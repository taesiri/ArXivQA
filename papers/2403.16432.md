# [$\textit{LinkPrompt}$: Natural and Universal Adversarial Attacks on   Prompt-based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16432)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt-based learning is an emerging paradigm for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream tasks by using prompt templates. However, the prompt optimization process also introduces vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.  
- Prior universal adversarial triggers (UATs) are often meaningless token combinations that lack naturalness and can be detected by defenses.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes \textit{LinkPrompt}, an algorithm to generate natural and effective UATs for prompt-based models. 
- It uses a joint loss function to balance attack success rate (fool models) and semantic meaning (naturalness) when searching UATs on PLMs. 
- The optimized triggers are transferred to attack prompt-based fine-tuned models (PFMs).

Main Contributions:
- Achieves high attack success rate while ensuring naturalness among trigger tokens, evaluated by semantic similarity and ChatGPT.
- Demonstrates strong transferability of UATs from PLM (RoBERTa) to other models like BERT, Llama2 and GPT-3.5.
- Proposes a perplexity-based defense and shows \textit{LinkPrompt} triggers are more resilient than baseline method.

In summary, the paper presents an effective algorithm named \textit{LinkPrompt} to generate natural universal adversarial triggers that can attack prompt-based models. It shows the vulnerability of prompt tuning methods to such semantically meaningful triggers and their transferability across models. The proposed defense method also has limitations against \textit{LinkPrompt}.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LinkPrompt, a novel universal adversarial attack algorithm to generate natural trigger phrases that can mislead prompt-based fine-tuned language models while maintaining inherent semantic meaning among the trigger tokens, demonstrating high attack success rates, transferability to models like Llama2 and GPT-3.5, and stability against perplexity-based defenses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes LinkPrompt, a universal adversarial attack algorithm on Prompt-based Fine-tuned Models (PFMs) that can both mislead the models and maintain the inherent naturalness of generated universal adversarial triggers (UATs). A joint objective function is designed to achieve this goal.

2. It leverages an angle-optimized text embedding model called AnglE and ChatGPT as additional evaluation methods beyond perplexity to better measure the naturalness of UATs generated by LinkPrompt.

3. It conducts a transferability study of LinkPrompt on BERT, as well as on the open-sourced large language model Llama2 and the API-accessed large language model GPT-3.5-turbo. 

4. It performs extensive experiments that validate LinkPrompt outperforms the baseline method, achieving a higher attack success rate while also increasing naturalness. The results also demonstrate LinkPrompt's strong transferability and stability against an adaptive defense method.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LinkPrompt attack algorithm that can generate effective and natural UATs on PFMs, and demonstrating its transferability and reliability through comprehensive experiments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this research include:

- Prompt-based learning - A language model training paradigm that adapts pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream tasks using prompt templates.

- Universal adversarial triggers (UATs) - Input-agnostic perturbations that can cause a model to make incorrect predictions.

- LinkPrompt - The proposed gradient-based beam search algorithm to generate natural and effective UATs that can attack prompt-based fine-tuned models. 

- Attack success rate (ASR) - The percentage of correctly predicted examples that are fooled into misclassification after adding the UAT. Used to measure attack effectiveness.

- Semantic similarity score (SSS) - Score to quantify the semantic closeness of the adversarially perturbed sentence to the original for evaluating naturalness. 

- Transferability - The ability of UATs optimized on one model to also mislead other models. Evaluated on BERT, Llama2, GPT-3.5.

- Adaptive defense - A perplexity-based filtering method proposed to detect UATs.

In summary, the key focus is on developing a method to craft universal adversarial triggers that are natural in appearance but can fool prompt-based language models, and analyzing their effectiveness, semantics, and transferability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes optimizing two loss functions - one for attack effectiveness and one for semantic meaning. How are these two loss functions balanced in the overall objective function? What is the impact of using different relative weights between these two terms?

2. The semantic meaning objective relies on using the language model's predictions to assess semantic coherence. What are some potential limitations or failure modes of relying on the language model in this way? Could the language model be fooled about semantic meaning?  

3. The paper demonstrates transferring triggers from RoBERTa to BERT, and two other language models. What factors affect the transferability of triggers to new models? Would you expect even better transferability to models trained on similar data and architectures?

4. The adaptive defense method based on perplexity is shown to be limited. What other potential defense methods could be proposed? Can you think of ways to leverage large language models themselves to try to detect unnatural triggers?

5. Beam search is used along with the gradient to generate trigger tokens. What is the effect of using beam search here versus simpler greedy decoding? How sensitive are the results to the beam size?

6. How might the attack be extended to conditional generation tasks like translation instead of just classification? What changes would need to be made to the attack setup and optimization?

7. The semantic meaning objective relies on the trigger tokens alone. Can you think of any ways to try to maintain meaning between the trigger and input while still keeping universality across inputs?

8. The triggers are optimized on a separate corpus before attacking downstream models. What is the impact of instead optimizing on data similar to the target tasks? Would that improve attack transferrability? 

9. The method targets inserting triggers between the input and prompt. What changes would be needed to generate triggers as suffixes/prefixes as in some other work? 

10. The human evaluations rely on relative comparisons between triggers. Can you propose any methods to assess trigger naturalness in an absolute sense without comparisons?
