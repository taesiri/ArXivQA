# [Multi-Task Learning for Routing Problem with Cross-Problem Zero-Shot   Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are an important class of combinatorial optimization problems with many real-world logistics applications. 
- There are many variants of VRPs with different constraints such as vehicle capacities, time windows, open routes, backhauls, etc.
- Existing neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods typically require training an individual model per VRP variant from scratch. This is computationally expensive and hinders practical applications.
- The ability to generalize across different VRP variants has not been well studied.

Proposed Solution:
- Treat VRP variants as combinations of a common set of underlying attributes (vehicle capacity, time windows, open routes, backhauls, duration limits).
- Propose a unified neural network model to solve multiple VRP variants simultaneously via multi-task learning.
- The model has an encoder-decoder structure with an additional attribute composition block to handle constraints.
- Train the unified model on a few VRP variants through reinforcement learning.
- Show that the model can generalize to unseen VRP variants with new combinations of attributes in a zero-shot manner without retraining.

Main Contributions:
- First work to study cross-problem generalization for neural solvers on VRPs.
- Novel unified model with attribute composition to enable sharing of common constraints across variants.  
- Multi-task learning approach to train a single model on multiple VRPs.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization performance to 11 VRP variants, reducing avg. optimality gap from 20% to 5%.
- Validated on benchmark datasets and real-world logistics cases, outperforming single-task models.
