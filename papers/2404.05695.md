# [Humanoid-Gym: Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Robot with Zero-Shot   Sim2Real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Sim-to-real transfer of locomotion policies for humanoid robots is challenging due to their complex structure, resulting in a large sim-to-real gap. Existing solutions for quadrupedal robots do not directly transfer to humanoids. There is a lack of open source resources to enable sim-to-real transfer for humanoid locomotion.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Humanoid-Gym, an open source reinforcement learning (RL) framework for training locomotion skills for humanoid robots. The key aspects are:

1. Specialized reward function and domain randomization techniques tailored for humanoids to simplify sim-to-real transfer. 

2. Integration of Nvidia Isaac Gym for fast parallel simulation during training, and MuJoCo for more accurate dynamics during policy validation. This combines the benefits of both.

3. Rigorous calibration of MuJoCo dynamics to closely match real-world robot performance. This enables sim-to-sim verification of policies.

4. Demonstrated zero-shot transfer from simulation to real XBot-S and XBot-L humanoid robots using trained policies.

Main Contributions:

1. Open source Humanoid-Gym framework with meticulous system design for sim-to-real transfer.

2. Zero-shot transfer of locomotion policies from simulation to real humanoid robots of different sizes.

3. Sim-to-sim validation tool using MuJoCo dynamics to test policy robustness across diverse environments.

The experiments showcase locomotion skills trained in Isaac Gym and deployed directly on physical XBot humanoids traversing flat terrain and complex uneven terrain successfully. This demonstrates the sim-to-real effectiveness of the approach.
