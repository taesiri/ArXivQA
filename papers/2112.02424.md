Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work:- The paper proposes a numerical algorithm for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, which model gradient dynamics on the space of probability densities with respect to the Wasserstein metric. This is an active area of research with applications in PDEs, sampling, optimal transport, and other fields.- Most prior work on numerically computing Wasserstein gradient flows relies on finite difference methods applied to the PDE representation.
