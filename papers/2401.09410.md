# [Through the Looking-Glass: Transparency Implications and Challenges in   Enterprise AI Knowledge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As AI knowledge systems that represent people's expertise get embedded in enterprises, they can shape how individuals see themselves and others in the organization. These systems extract knowledge from work artifacts like documents and surface associations between people, knowledge topics and content. However, the associations surfaced can be incomplete or inaccurate, leading to potential harms. The paper argues that transparency around these systems is important to mitigate risks, but it is unclear what transparency is needed and what challenges exist in providing meaningful transparency. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using the "looking-glass" metaphor to conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that both reflect and distort. This metaphor highlights that these systems enable different types of seeing - seeing into the system to understand how it works, seeing others individually and collectively through the system lenses, and seeing oneself reflected back. The authors identify 3 key transparency dimensions needed - system transparency, procedural transparency and transparency of outcomes. System transparency covers how the AI system technically works. Procedural transparency covers how the system is used in context within the organization. Transparency of outcomes covers the impacts of the system over time.

Main Contributions:
1) The looking-glass metaphor to expand the view of transparency in AI systems from just system internals to also seeing through the system lens and its sociotechnical implications.
2) Identification of 3 key transparency dimensions needed for AI knowledge systems - system, procedural, and outcomes transparency. 
3) Analysis of challenges in providing meaningful transparency in each dimension - e.g. tracking system use in context, limitations in measuring outcomes, risk of reinforceing stigma by overtransparency.
4) Recommendations for future research on transparency implications on self-concept and perceptions, power-aware transparency mechanisms, and economic views on information asymmetry.

The paper takes an important step in analyzing transparency needs and challenges unique to AI systems focused on knowledge and expertise representation. The looking-glass metaphor and analysis of sociotechnical considerations significantly expands the discourse on responsible AI transparency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper proposes conceptualizing AI knowledge systems that represent people and knowledge as "looking glasses" that both reflect and distort to analyze transparency needs for seeing into the system and seeing others and self through it, identifying key challenges regarding communication, faithfulness, actionability, measurement, and unintended incentives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are four-fold:

1. It presents the looking-glass metaphor and uses it to conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that both reflect and distort, enabling different types of seeing. This framework allows the authors to widen the scope of transparency needs, moving beyond just allowing users to see into the system.

2. It uses the looking-glass metaphor to explore the impacts of different types of seeing enabled by AI knowledge systems and identifies key requirements for transparency across three dimensions: system transparency, procedural transparency, and transparency of outcomes. 

3. It discusses key challenges that hinder the implementation of these forms of transparency, bringing to light the wider sociotechnical gap and tradeoffs to enable decision-making and support interdisciplinary discourse.

4. It identifies future areas of transparency research in AI knowledge systems, encouraging CSCW researchers to further study transparency implications and first-order approximations to the problems highlighted in the paper.

In summary, the main contribution is using the looking-glass metaphor to expand the discussion of AI transparency beyond purely technical aspects, to also consider social and psychological implications of different ways of seeing through these systems. This enables a wider perspective on transparency needs and challenges.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Transparency - The paper focuses on transparency in enterprise AI knowledge systems, including dimensions like system transparency, procedural transparency, and transparency of outcomes. It explores transparency needs, implications, and challenges.

- Looking-glass metaphor - The paper introduces this metaphor to conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that both reflect and distort, enabling different types of seeing. 

- Ways of seeing - The paper discusses different types of seeing enabled by AI knowledge systems, including seeing into the system, seeing others individually/collectively through the system, and seeing self through the system. 

- Self-concept - The paper grounds its analysis in theories of self-concept and how algorithmic systems can impact self-perceptions, identity, motivation etc.

- Knowledge systems - The paper specifically looks at a class of AI systems aimed at improving knowledge management and expertise sharing in organizations, which extract and surface knowledge associations.

- Representational harms - Potential harms explored include representational harms from distorted or inaccurate algorithmic representations surfaced by these systems.

- Interpersonal harms - Other potential harms discussed are interpersonal harms stemming from how these systems shape seeing and perceiving others in an organization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the "looking-glass" metaphor to conceptualize AI knowledge systems. What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of using this metaphor compared to other conceptual frameworks like the "black box" metaphor? How might it shape or limit our understanding of transparency issues?

2. The authors identify three key dimensions of transparency - system, procedural, and outcomes. In your view, is this categorization sufficient and comprehensive for thinking about transparency in AI knowledge systems? What other categories might be missing or worth considering?  

3. The paper discusses potential negative impacts of AI knowledge systems on self-concept and interpersonal perceptions. In your opinion, what other psychological or social impacts should designers be cognizant of when implementing transparency?

4. When thinking about transparency of outcomes, the authors note challenges around measurement and attribution of impacts to system use. What creative or novel approaches could help address these challenges to make outcomes more transparent over time?  

5. Could full transparency of an AI knowledge system ever be achieved in practice? What technical and social barriers stand in the way? How might we prioritize or tier transparency along different dimensions given inevitable constraints?

6. The paper warns about potential misuse of transparency information and perverse incentives that could arise. What safeguards could system designers or organizations put in place to prevent these risks when implementing transparency features? 

7. What role should end-users themselves play in co-designing transparency features for AI knowledge systems? How might participatory design approaches help align transparency implementations to genuine user needs?  

8. How should transparency needs and implementations differ based on the specific use case for an AI knowledge system (e.g. expert finding vs knowledge management)? What contextual factors should determine transparency requirements?

9. The paper focuses on enterprise contexts, but how might transparency needs and challenges differ for public sector or consumer-facing AI knowledge systems? What parallels or differences might we expect?

10. What questions are left unanswered by this paper in terms of mapping out an agenda for future research? What empirical work is needed to substantiate the conceptual analysis put forward here?
