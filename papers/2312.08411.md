# [Pose and shear-based tactile servoing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Tactile sensing can enable robots to precisely manipulate objects by adapting to changes in real-time contact interactions. However, estimating accurate tactile information for servo control is challenging. Prior methods have focused only on contact pose, but post-contact shear is also useful. Controlling based on pose/shear estimates is difficult due to issues like tactile aliasing and representing uncertainty on non-Euclidean state spaces like SE(3).

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a tactile robotic system that utilizes both contact pose and shear estimation for closed-loop control. Key aspects include:

1) A Gaussian density network (GDN) that predicts the means and uncertainties of both pose and shear based on tactile images. This handles uncertainty better than standard CNN regression models.

2) An SE(3) Bayesian filter that reduces error and uncertainty in sequential pose/shear predictions by the GDN using estimates of state dynamics. Custom derivations handle non-Gaussian distributions.

3) Feedforward-feedback controllers using velocity control in SE(3) based on filtered pose/shear, enabling smooth motion tracking surfaces or pushing objects. 

4) Demonstrations of tracking complex leader-arm motions, following curved surfaces, precisely pushing objects to target locations using one or two robot arms.

Main Contributions:

- Unified estimation of contact pose and post-contact shear in SE(3) using a Gaussian density network, improving on prior tactile pose-only methods

- SE(3) Bayesian filter for sequential estimation under uncertainty by novel derivation of probabilistic inference steps 

- General methodology utilizing pose/shear for accurate tactile servo control tasks like tracking, pushing, surface following with smooth continuous motion

- Technical advancements in uncertainty representation and control in SE(3) applied to a tactile robot system and demonstrated on real-world tasks

The proposed system advances state-of-the-art in tactile perception and control to enable more dexterous robotic manipulation. Key novelty is tightly integrating pose, shear and control uncertainty on SE(3) via novel probabilistic filtering and control techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper develops a tactile robotic system that uses neural networks to estimate surface contact pose and shear from tactile images, reduces the resulting uncertainty with Bayesian filtering, and leverages this state estimation in feedforward-feedback control schemes on SE(3) to demonstrate precise manipulation capabilities like object tracking, surface following, and single- and dual-arm pushing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to tactile robotic systems:

1. It proposes a method to estimate both the contact pose and post-contact shear from tactile images using a Gaussian density network (GDN) model. This allows the system to perceive and respond to tangential motions that occur after making contact, which enables new manipulation capabilities. 

2. It introduces a discriminative Bayesian filter to reduce the error and uncertainty of the GDN pose and shear estimates. This filtering approach is tailored for the Lie group structure of SE(3) by using approximations and iterations derived from Lie group theory.

3. It demonstrates smooth, continuous velocity control of a robotic manipulator by using the filtered pose and shear estimates. This is implemented as an SE(3) feedforward-feedback controller that outperforms previous position-based approaches. 

4. It shows how this tactile control system with pose and shear perception can enable diverse manipulation tasks such as object tracking, surface following, and single-arm and dual-arm pushing of objects. The dual-arm pushing, in particular, leverages the pose and shear estimation to have one arm push objects while the second arm holds them stable.

In summary, the main contribution is a complete tactile robotic system that perceives both contact pose and shear from tactile images, reduces the uncertainty in these estimates, and uses them to demonstrate advanced manipulation capabilities not possible without tangential shear control. The novel theoretical components are the GDN model, SE(3) Bayesian filter and feedforward-feedback controller.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper combines contact pose and post-contact shear into a unified surface contact pose-and-shear vector. What are the key assumptions behind this representation and what are its limitations? How could the method be extended to apply to a wider range of contact scenarios?

2. The Gaussian density network (GDN) model is used to predict both the mean and uncertainty of the pose and shear components. What extensions to the GDN architecture helped overcome issues like training instability and mode collapse? How sensitive is performance to choices like the output dropout probabilities?  

3. The $SE(3)$ discriminative Bayesian filter combines the GDN predictions over time. What assumptions does this make about the state dynamics model relating consecutive predictions? How is performance impacted by factors like the state dynamics noise level?

4. How exactly is the prediction step of the $SE(3)$ Bayesian filter derived? What difficulties arise in trying to marginalize over the previous state distribution and how are they overcome? 

5. What difficulties arise when trying to fuse two $SE(3)$ probability distributions? Why can't a closed-form solution be found like in the Gaussian case? How does the iterative fusion algorithm approximate the true normalized product?

6. The velocity-based tactile servoing controller uses techniques from control theory developed for Euclidean spaces. What issues arise from applying them to $SE(3)$ and how are they addressed? 

7. How exactly is the pose error computed that is used in the tactile servoing controller? Why is it represented in the vector space tangent to $SE(3)$ instead of directly in the group itself?

8. How does the target alignment controller steer the pushed object towards the specified goal? When is this controller activated and deactivated over the course of a pushing sequence?

9. The assumptions of a locally flat contact surface and decomposition into normal then shear motions aim to simplify the method. When might these assumptions break down? How could the approach handle more complex surface shapes?  

10. The results demonstrate the method on various manipulation tasks. What planning capabilities would further improve the system's ability to accomplish more complex goals and avoid undesired situations?
