# [Pose and shear-based tactile servoing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Tactile sensing can enable robots to precisely manipulate objects by adapting to changes in real-time contact interactions. However, estimating accurate tactile information for servo control is challenging. Prior methods have focused only on contact pose, but post-contact shear is also useful. Controlling based on pose/shear estimates is difficult due to issues like tactile aliasing and representing uncertainty on non-Euclidean state spaces like SE(3).

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a tactile robotic system that utilizes both contact pose and shear estimation for closed-loop control. Key aspects include:

1) A Gaussian density network (GDN) that predicts the means and uncertainties of both pose and shear based on tactile images. This handles uncertainty better than standard CNN regression models.

2) An SE(3) Bayesian filter that reduces error and uncertainty in sequential pose/shear predictions by the GDN using estimates of state dynamics. Custom derivations handle non-Gaussian distributions.

3) Feedforward-feedback controllers using velocity control in SE(3) based on filtered pose/shear, enabling smooth motion tracking surfaces or pushing objects. 

4) Demonstrations of tracking complex leader-arm motions, following curved surfaces, precisely pushing objects to target locations using one or two robot arms.

Main Contributions:

- Unified estimation of contact pose and post-contact shear in SE(3) using a Gaussian density network, improving on prior tactile pose-only methods

- SE(3) Bayesian filter for sequential estimation under uncertainty by novel derivation of probabilistic inference steps 

- General methodology utilizing pose/shear for accurate tactile servo control tasks like tracking, pushing, surface following with smooth continuous motion

- Technical advancements in uncertainty representation and control in SE(3) applied to a tactile robot system and demonstrated on real-world tasks

The proposed system advances state-of-the-art in tactile perception and control to enable more dexterous robotic manipulation. Key novelty is tightly integrating pose, shear and control uncertainty on SE(3) via novel probabilistic filtering and control techniques.
