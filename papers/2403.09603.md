# [Optimistic Verifiable Training by Controlling Hardware Nondeterminism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09603)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Optimistic Verifiable Training by Controlling Hardware Nondeterminism":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of verifiable training of machine learning models. As model training is increasingly being outsourced to third-party providers that have vast compute resources, clients lack the ability to verify that the training was done correctly without any data poisoning or backdoor attacks. Existing solutions either rely on cryptographic proofs that struggle to scale, or "optimistic" schemes with auditors that fail due to hardware nondeterminism between GPU types preventing exact replication of training.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a verifiable training scheme based on an interactive "verification game" between a trainer and auditor. To address hardware nondeterminism, the trainer performs computation in higher precision (FP64) than the model (FP32), rounds intermediate outputs, and logs rounding decisions. The auditor then matches the trainer's rounding to eliminate accumulation of errors. An adaptive thresholding method minimizes logged values. Both parties store hashes of model checkpoints in a Merkle tree for efficient comparison.

Main Contributions:

- A novel verifiable training scheme allowing a client to audit an untrusted trainer using an untrusted auditor by controlling hardware nondeterminism 
- Method to match floating point rounding decisions across different GPU types during training to achieve identical results
- Experiments showing the scheme scales to models like ResNet-50 and GPT-2 across three NVIDIA GPU architectures
- Techniques to reduce storage costs including efficient encoding of logs and adaptive thresholding
- Comparisons to alternatives like proof-based systems showing improved efficiency in storage and time

The scheme significantly advances optimistic verifiable training schemes by addressing nondeterminism and scaling to large models, reducing storage costs relative to alternatives by over 100x.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method for verifiable training of machine learning models that controls for hardware nondeterminism between GPU types by training in higher precision, rounding intermediate results, logging rounding decisions, and having an auditor correct their rounding to match the trainer's choices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel method for verifiable training of machine learning models that successfully controls for hardware nondeterminism between different GPU types. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a verifiable training scheme based on the verification game from Teutsch et al. (2019), where model weights are stored in a Merkle tree for efficient comparison between a trainer and auditor. 

2) The paper introduces a technique to eliminate errors from hardware nondeterminism during training by: (a) performing computation in higher precision than the target model, (b) rounding intermediate results, and (c) logging rounding decisions so that an auditor can replicate the exact training procedure.

3) Experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to scale to large models like ResNet-50 and GPT-2, training identically across three different NVIDIA GPU architectures. The method significantly reduces storage and time costs compared to alternative verifiable training techniques.

4) The paper discusses methods to reduce storage overhead of logging rounding decisions, including efficient encoding and an adaptive thresholding algorithm. Comparisons also highlight efficiency gains over existing proof-based systems.

In summary, the main contribution is a practical verifiable training scheme that successfully handles the issue of hardware nondeterminism to enable exact replication of training between different GPU types, providing efficiency and scalability improvements over prior art.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Verifiable training - Ensuring that the training of a machine learning model was performed correctly. A key focus of the paper.

- Hardware nondeterminism - The phenomenon where running the same model training procedure on different GPU types results in different learned weights, even with the same random seed. A key challenge the paper addresses. 

- Proof-based systems - Methods for verifiable training that rely on cryptographic proofs to verify correctness, but struggle to scale. Compared to in the paper.  

- Optimistic approaches - Alternative verifiable training methods that consider trusted third-party auditors to replicate training, but are limited by nondeterminism. The basis for the paper's approach.

- Rounding logs - The additional information provided by the trainer to the auditor in the paper's method to eliminate nondeterminism, by logging rounding decisions during intermediate computations.

- Storage cost reduction - Methods proposed in the paper to reduce the storage overhead of the rounding logs, including efficient encoding and adaptive thresholding.

- Verification game - The protocol based on a binary search through stored model checkpoints proposed by Teutsch et al. (2019), which the paper adapts for deep learning training tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes performing computation in higher precision and periodically rounding back to lower precision to control for nondeterminism. What is the intuition behind why this helps absorb errors from nondeterminism? How does the analysis with toy examples in Table 1 support this?

2. When rounding outputs, sometimes the trainer and auditor can round in different directions, introducing divergence (Figure 3, Case A). Explain why simply having the auditor copy the trainer's rounding decisions allows controlling for this issue. What is the purpose of also introducing a threshold tau?

3. Explain the binary search procedure proposed in Algorithm 2 for adaptively selecting layer-specific thresholds tau. What are the upper and lower bounds it searches between and why? How could finding larger tau values help improve compression of the rounding logs?

4. The paper argues that storing hashes of model weights in a Merkle tree is efficient only if nondeterminism is controlled for. Explain how the verification game described utilizes the Merkle tree and why nondeterminism would prevent this.

5. What modification did the authors need to make to PyTorch's randomness functionality for their method to work properly? What implication does this have when adapting the method in practice?

6. Although the paper focuses on using different GPU types between trainer and auditor, discuss whether you think the method could work for other sources of nondeterminism during training as well, such as differences in software versions.

7. The storage cost of logging rounding decisions is identified as the main limitation. The paper observes a gap between the number of logged values and those actually used by the auditor. Propose an idea for how future work could predict when divergence occurs to reduce logging.  

8. How does the time and storage cost of the verifiable training scheme proposed compare with existing proof-based systems you are familiar with? What are the tradeoffs to consider?

9. Critically analyze whether you think the scheme would still work if the model architecture itself was proprietary and not shared with the auditor. What implicit assumptions about model access does the paper make?

10. The scheme relies on trusting the auditor as a third party. Discuss whether ideas from secure multi-party computation could remove this need for trust, and what the limitations might be in scaling such an approach.
