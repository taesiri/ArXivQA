# [A Study on the Calibration of In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04021)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth study on the calibration of in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs). The authors investigate the trade-off between performance and calibration as more ICL examples are included, finding that calibration generally degrades even as accuracy improves. They conduct extensive experiments showing this issue worsens with increased model size and specialized fine-tuning strategies like human feedback. Common recalibration techniques like temperature scaling provide limited gains. On reasoning tasks involving generating explanations, models can produce confident yet incorrect answers. As model size and ICL samples increase, the proportion of wrongly-predicted confident examples rises too. The authors design controlled experiments revealing better consistency in ICL examples leads to improved learning performance and calibration. They discuss implications and future work like understanding ICL's internal mechanics related to calibration, and expanding calibration assessments beyond classification settings. Overall, this is a comprehensive analysis highlighting the intricate balance between accuracy and reliability for state-of-the-art LLMs adapted via ICL, with important considerations for real-world deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the trade-off between performance and calibration of in-context learning in large language models, finding that increasing model size and number of examples leads to better accuracy but worse calibration which cannot be easily fixed by standard recalibration techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper provides an in-depth evaluation and analysis of how well large language models are calibrated when adapted using in-context learning - specifically studying the alignment between the model's confidence in its predictions and the actual correctness of those predictions. Key findings include:

- There exists a trade-off between prediction accuracy and calibration error in in-context learning, with calibration worsening as more in-context examples are used to increase accuracy. 

- This calibration degradation becomes more pronounced with increasing model size and when models are fine-tuned on specialized data. 

- Common recalibration techniques like temperature scaling provide limited improvements, suggesting new methods may be needed to address miscalibration in settings where reliability is critical.

- The paper investigates task learning properties of in-context learning through controlled experiments, showing performance/calibration improves when prompt examples demonstrate consistent properties.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of calibration for in-context learning across diverse language models and datasets, highlighting accuracy-calibration tradeoffs and the fact that existing recalibration methods have limited effectiveness in this setting.
