# [A Study on the Calibration of In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04021)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth study on the calibration of in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs). The authors investigate the trade-off between performance and calibration as more ICL examples are included, finding that calibration generally degrades even as accuracy improves. They conduct extensive experiments showing this issue worsens with increased model size and specialized fine-tuning strategies like human feedback. Common recalibration techniques like temperature scaling provide limited gains. On reasoning tasks involving generating explanations, models can produce confident yet incorrect answers. As model size and ICL samples increase, the proportion of wrongly-predicted confident examples rises too. The authors design controlled experiments revealing better consistency in ICL examples leads to improved learning performance and calibration. They discuss implications and future work like understanding ICL's internal mechanics related to calibration, and expanding calibration assessments beyond classification settings. Overall, this is a comprehensive analysis highlighting the intricate balance between accuracy and reliability for state-of-the-art LLMs adapted via ICL, with important considerations for real-world deployment.
