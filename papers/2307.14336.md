# [MAMo: Leveraging Memory and Attention for Monocular Video Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14336)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main research question is how to leverage memory and attention mechanisms to improve monocular video depth estimation. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called MAMo that can take any existing monocular depth estimation model and augment it with memory and attention modules to enable video depth estimation. The key ideas/components of MAMo include:- Introducing a memory module that maintains useful visual and displacement tokens from previous frames to help guide depth prediction on the current frame. - Proposing a novel scheme to update the memory by encouraging it to retain features that are equivariant (invariant) to motion across the current and previous frames.- Using self-attention on the memory tokens and cross-attention between memory and current visual features to enable spatio-temporal processing.- Additional designs like carrying over past decoder features to further enhance utilization of temporal information.The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully introducing memory and attention, the model can learn to select and aggregate useful information from across multiple frames to perform more accurate video depth estimation, compared to just using a single frame. The experiments aim to validate whether MAMo consistently improves state-of-the-art monocular depth networks and outperforms other video depth estimation techniques.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively leverage memory and attention to enable existing monocular depth models to exploit temporal information for improved video depth prediction. The main hypothesis is that the proposed MAMo framework will allow for more accurate depth estimation compared to monocular as well as other video-based approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it looks like the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel memory and attention framework called MAMo for monocular video depth estimation. The key ideas are:- Augmenting depth estimation models with a memory module to store useful information from previous frames, which can help guide depth prediction on the current frame. - Introducing a new scheme to update the memory by minimizing the difference between depth predictions on the current frame and a warped version of the previous frame. This encourages the memory to capture equivariant features across frames.- Using attention mechanisms to process the memory features and fuse them with encoder features of the current frame before feeding to the decoder.- Applying MAMo to latest monocular depth networks like NeWCRFs and PixelFormer to convert them into effective video depth models.- Demonstrating through experiments that MAMo consistently improves monocular depth networks and achieves state-of-the-art video depth estimation accuracy on KITTI, NYU-Depth V2 etc.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the memory and attention based MAMo framework to enable monocular networks to leverage temporal information for accurate and efficient video depth estimation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the abstract provided, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of monocular video depth estimation:- This paper proposes a novel framework called MAMo that leverages memory and attention mechanisms to enable monocular image depth estimation models to utilize temporal information from video frames. In contrast, most prior monocular depth estimation methods focus solely on single image inputs. - The key novelty is the use of a memory module that stores useful visual and displacement tokens from previous frames. These tokens are updated over time and used to guide depth prediction on the current frame via cross-attention. This allows leveraging motion-equivariant features while filtering noise.- Many existing video depth estimation methods rely on computationally expensive cost volumes or recurrent networks. MAMo provides an efficient attention-based alternative that can build on latest image-based models like NeWCRFs and PixelFormer.- Experiments show MAMo consistently improves multiple monocular models and sets new state-of-the-art on benchmarks like KITTI, surpassing prior multi-frame video depth methods. It significantly boosts accuracy while adding little computation overhead.- Overall, MAMo provides an effective way to transform image-based depth estimators into video models via memory and attention. The core ideas around updating and utilizing memory tokens are novel for this problem. The results demonstrate clear benefits over existing works in video depth estimation in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.In summary, this paper introduces a novel attention-based technique to effectively leverage temporal information for depth estimation that outperforms prior arts and demonstrates the advantages of memory and attention for this task. The core concepts could inspire new directions in video understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on reviewing the paper, here are the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more efficient and lightweight architectures for video depth estimation. The paper notes that cost volume-based methods have high computational complexity and memory usage. As such, exploring architectures that can achieve strong performance without using cost volumes is an important direction. The authors propose a memory and attention-based approach as a step in this direction.- Improving generalization across different datasets. The authors evaluate generalization by training on KITTI and testing on DDAD. Further improving cross-dataset generalization is noted as an important goal. Architectures that can learn representations that generalize better would be valuable.- Enhancing temporal consistency in video depth estimation. The paper briefly explores evaluating temporal consistency, but further improving smoothness and consistency over the video frames is noted as an area for future work. This could involve losses, network designs, incorporating optical flow, etc.- Combining ideas from monocular depth networks and video depth networks. The authors propose an approach to convert monocular networks to video networks that can benefit from temporal information. Further combining insights from the two areas to boost accuracy is suggested as a direction.- Leveraging unlabeled videos and unpaired data. The paper focuses on fully supervised training, but self-supervised and semi-supervised techniques could help improve generalization and reduce labeling requirements.- Applying video depth networks to broader applications like robotics, AR/VR, etc. Evaluating the real-world usefulness of video depth networks beyond benchmarks is noted as an area for future work.In summary, the key directions mentioned are: more efficient architectures, better generalization, enhanced consistency, combining monocular and video ideas, utilizing unlabeled data, and applications of video depth networks. The authors propose interesting ideas to improve video depth estimation and suggest promising avenues for future research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents MAMo, a novel memory and attention framework for monocular video depth estimation. MAMo can augment and improve any single-image depth estimation networks into video depth estimation models, enabling them to take advantage of the temporal information to predict more accurate depth. In MAMo, they augment the model with a memory module which stores learned visual and displacement tokens from previous frames to help guide depth prediction on the current frame. They introduce a scheme to update the memory by minimizing the difference between depth predictions on the current frame and a motion-compensated version of it. The updated memory tokens are processed via self-attention and fused with current frame features using cross-attention before feeding into the decoder to predict depth. Through experiments on KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and DDAD datasets, they demonstrate that MAMo consistently improves various state-of-the-art monocular depth networks and achieves new state-of-the-art video depth estimation accuracy. A key benefit is that MAMo does not require computationally expensive operations like cost volume construction.
