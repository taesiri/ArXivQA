# [MAMo: Leveraging Memory and Attention for Monocular Video Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14336)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main research question is how to leverage memory and attention mechanisms to improve monocular video depth estimation. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called MAMo that can take any existing monocular depth estimation model and augment it with memory and attention modules to enable video depth estimation. The key ideas/components of MAMo include:

- Introducing a memory module that maintains useful visual and displacement tokens from previous frames to help guide depth prediction on the current frame. 

- Proposing a novel scheme to update the memory by encouraging it to retain features that are equivariant (invariant) to motion across the current and previous frames.

- Using self-attention on the memory tokens and cross-attention between memory and current visual features to enable spatio-temporal processing.

- Additional designs like carrying over past decoder features to further enhance utilization of temporal information.

The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully introducing memory and attention, the model can learn to select and aggregate useful information from across multiple frames to perform more accurate video depth estimation, compared to just using a single frame. The experiments aim to validate whether MAMo consistently improves state-of-the-art monocular depth networks and outperforms other video depth estimation techniques.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively leverage memory and attention to enable existing monocular depth models to exploit temporal information for improved video depth prediction. The main hypothesis is that the proposed MAMo framework will allow for more accurate depth estimation compared to monocular as well as other video-based approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it looks like the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel memory and attention framework called MAMo for monocular video depth estimation. The key ideas are:

- Introducing a new scheme to update the memory by minimizing the difference between depth predictions on the current frame and a warped version of the previous frame. This encourages the memory to capture equivariant features across frames.

- Using attention mechanisms to process the memory features and fuse them with encoder features of the current frame before feeding to the decoder.

- Applying MAMo to latest monocular depth networks like NeWCRFs and PixelFormer to convert them into effective video depth models.

- Demonstrating through experiments that MAMo consistently improves monocular depth networks and achieves state-of-the-art video depth estimation accuracy on KITTI, NYU-Depth V2 etc.

- Experiments show MAMo consistently improves multiple monocular models and sets new state-of-the-art on benchmarks like KITTI, surpassing prior multi-frame video depth methods. It significantly boosts accuracy while adding little computation overhead.

- Overall, MAMo provides an effective way to transform image-based depth estimators into video models via memory and attention. The core ideas around updating and utilizing memory tokens are novel for this problem. The results demonstrate clear benefits over existing works in video depth estimation in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel attention-based technique to effectively leverage temporal information for depth estimation that outperforms prior arts and demonstrates the advantages of memory and attention for this task. The core concepts could inspire new directions in video understanding.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MAMo, a novel memory and attention framework for monocular video depth estimation. MAMo can augment any single-image depth estimation network into a video depth estimation model by enabling it to leverage temporal information for more accurate depth prediction. 

In MAMo, the model is augmented with a memory module that stores visual and displacement tokens from previous frames to assist in depth prediction for the current frame. The memory is continuously updated to retain relevant information. The visual memory tokens are processed via self-attention and then fused with current frame features through cross-attention before final depth prediction. Additionally, the framework carries over decoder features from the previous timestep and utilizes optical flow as input cues. Through experiments on KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and DDAD datasets, MAMo is shown to consistently improve various monocular networks and achieve state-of-the-art video depth estimation accuracy.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel memory and attention framework, MAMo, for monocular video depth estimation. MAMo augments any existing monocular depth estimation network with a memory module to store useful features from previous frames. These memory features are updated at each time step to capture motion-equivariant information between the current and previous frames. The updated memory features are processed via self-attention and then fused with encoder features of the current frame using cross-attention.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the authors are addressing the problem of video depth estimation, i.e. estimating depth from consecutive video frames captured by a monocular camera. Some key points I gathered:

- Standard monocular depth estimation methods only use single images and cannot leverage temporal information from videos, even though video data is often available in applications like robotics and autonomous driving.

- Existing video depth estimation methods rely on computationally expensive operations like cost volume construction or do not achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. 

- The authors propose a new approach called MAMo that enables any monocular depth estimation network to perform video depth estimation by augmenting it with memory and attention modules.

- MAMo maintains a memory that stores useful information from previous frames. This memory is updated in a novel way to retain motion-equivariant features relevant for the current frame. 

- The memory features are processed via self-attention and fused with current frame features using cross-attention to guide depth prediction.

- This allows MAMo to leverage temporal information effectively while being efficient compared to cost volume methods. Experiments show it consistently improves latest monocular networks and achieves new state-of-the-art video depth estimation accuracy.

In summary, the key problem is leveraging temporal video information to improve monocular depth prediction accuracy in an efficient streaming manner, which their proposed MAMo framework aims to address.
