# [EuroCrops: All you need to know about the Largest Harmonised Open Crop   Dataset Across the European Union](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10202)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can administrative agricultural subsidy control data from different European countries be harmonized and compiled into a unified dataset to enable cross-border analysis of agricultural crops?The key points I gathered are:- The goal of the EuroCrops project is to create a large, harmonized dataset of crop information across Europe by compiling and standardizing administrative data from different countries. - This administrative data comes from farmers' self-declarations when applying for agricultural subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. It contains geo-referenced crop parcel polygons and information on the crop species grown.- The authors collected such administrative crop data from 16 EU countries. The raw data had to be manually translated and mapped to a standardized crop taxonomy developed by the authors called HCAT (Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy).- The result is a harmonized vector dataset called EuroCrops covering the crop species grown in different regions of Europe. It enables new cross-border analysis of agricultural diversity, crop yields, food security, etc. - The authors describe the iterative process of data collection, translation/harmonization, and validation. They release the dataset publicly to enable further expansion and improvement.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that compiling and standardizing administrative crop data can produce a valuable harmonized dataset to enable new pan-European analysis of agriculture, which has not been feasible before with nationally fragmented data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- The compilation and release of the EuroCrops dataset, which contains geo-referenced polygons showing crop fields and information on the cultivated crops across 16 countries in the European Union. - The development of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) to organize and standardize the crop classes found across different EU countries into a common taxonomy.- The collection and harmonization of the raw crop declaration data from individual EU countries into a single dataset with English crop names mapped to the HCAT taxonomy. This involved translating crop names from national languages and fitting them into the HCAT structure.- Providing the methodology, code, and taxonomy mapping to enable extension of the dataset over time and to additional countries.In summary, the key contribution is creating a large-scale standardized open dataset of crop information across Europe by collecting and harmonizing administrative agricultural data from different countries. This can enable new cross-border analyses and insights in domains like agricultural diversity, food security, and crop monitoring.
