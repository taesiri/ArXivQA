# [EuroCrops: All you need to know about the Largest Harmonised Open Crop   Dataset Across the European Union](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10202)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can administrative agricultural subsidy control data from different European countries be harmonized and compiled into a unified dataset to enable cross-border analysis of agricultural crops?

The key points I gathered are:

- The goal of the EuroCrops project is to create a large, harmonized dataset of crop information across Europe by compiling and standardizing administrative data from different countries. 

- This administrative data comes from farmers' self-declarations when applying for agricultural subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. It contains geo-referenced crop parcel polygons and information on the crop species grown.

- The authors collected such administrative crop data from 16 EU countries. The raw data had to be manually translated and mapped to a standardized crop taxonomy developed by the authors called HCAT (Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy).

- The result is a harmonized vector dataset called EuroCrops covering the crop species grown in different regions of Europe. It enables new cross-border analysis of agricultural diversity, crop yields, food security, etc. 

- The authors describe the iterative process of data collection, translation/harmonization, and validation. They release the dataset publicly to enable further expansion and improvement.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that compiling and standardizing administrative crop data can produce a valuable harmonized dataset to enable new pan-European analysis of agriculture, which has not been feasible before with nationally fragmented data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- The compilation and release of the EuroCrops dataset, which contains geo-referenced polygons showing crop fields and information on the cultivated crops across 16 countries in the European Union. 

- The development of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) to organize and standardize the crop classes found across different EU countries into a common taxonomy.

- The collection and harmonization of the raw crop declaration data from individual EU countries into a single dataset with English crop names mapped to the HCAT taxonomy. This involved translating crop names from national languages and fitting them into the HCAT structure.

- Providing the methodology, code, and taxonomy mapping to enable extension of the dataset over time and to additional countries.

In summary, the key contribution is creating a large-scale standardized open dataset of crop information across Europe by collecting and harmonizing administrative agricultural data from different countries. This can enable new cross-border analyses and insights in domains like agricultural diversity, food security, and crop monitoring.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points of the paper:

The paper presents EuroCrops, a new dataset consisting of harmonized, geo-referenced crop type data across 16 European Union countries, which was manually collected from various national sources, translated, and mapped to a common crop taxonomy to enable cross-border agricultural research and analysis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of open crop mapping datasets:

- The goal of creating a harmonized, open crop mapping dataset covering multiple European countries is similar to other efforts like BreizhCrops, ZueriCrop, CropHarvest, etc. However, EuroCrops aims to cover a much larger geographical area (16 EU countries) and incorporate more crop types into its taxonomy.

- The methods used - collecting and integrating administrative subsidy data from different countries, translating crop types, and mapping them to a unified taxonomy - builds on approaches used in previous projects. The key novelties seem to be the development of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) to categorize crops across Europe, and the level of manual work involved in collecting, cleaning, and mapping very heterogeneous data sources.

- Validation through community feedback and comparisons to official crop area statistics (via the JRC MARS database) is a good practice also seen in related work. The acknowledgement that ground-truthing the self-reported data is difficult at scale seems realistic.

- Making both the harmonized crop dataset and the mapping to national crop types open and available on GitHub is a major contribution. This enables further reuse and expansion of the data in a transparent way.

- The scope and coverage of EuroCrops appears unmatched by any previous effort in this domain. The spatial extent across most of Europe, number of crop types covered, and manual work involved are all impressive.

Overall, EuroCrops represents an ambitious expansion on previous open crop mapping works for Europe, in terms of geographic and taxonomic scope. The methods build on established practices but had to be scaled up substantially. The result is a uniquely comprehensive and granular multi-country crop dataset that can enable new applications and research questions to be explored.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending the dataset temporally by including more years of data. The current EuroCrops dataset only includes a single year of harmonized data for most countries, but the authors suggest extending it to multiple years to enable temporal analysis. 

- Adding more countries and regions. The authors collected data from 16 EU countries for this dataset, but suggest expanding it to cover all EU member states. They also mention potentially expanding beyond the EU.

- Enhancing the taxonomy to include more crop types. As more countries are added, new crop types not currently represented in the taxonomy will likely need to be incorporated. The taxonomy will need to be continually expanded.

- Using the dataset for food security and agricultural diversity analysis across Europe. The authors suggest the dataset could be valuable for researching questions around agricultural diversity and food security across the EU.

- Combining the dataset with satellite imagery for crop monitoring and yield prediction models. A key motivation is using the data as ground truth reference data for satellite-based crop monitoring and yield estimation models.

- Crowd-sourcing and community feedback to improve the dataset. The authors emphasize the value of an active user community to validate the data and suggest crowdsourcing as a way to enhance the dataset.

- Adding additional attributes beyond crop type (e.g. yield data). The current dataset only includes crop type, but adding additional attributes like yield could increase its value.

In summary, the key directions are: expanding coverage temporally, spatially and in terms of crop types represented; using the dataset for food security and diversity research; integrating it with satellite data for crop models; and leveraging crowdsourcing and community feedback to improve accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new dataset called EuroCrops, which consists of geo-referenced agricultural crop data across 16 countries in the European Union. The crop data originates from farmers' self-declarations when receiving agricultural subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Over the past 1.5 years, the authors manually collected and harmonized the crop data from each country by translating crop names into English and mapping them to a newly developed Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT). This provides a unified taxonomy for crop types across Europe. The harmonized EuroCrops dataset, along with links to original data sources and HCAT mapping files, is publicly released to enable analysis of agricultural diversity and food security across Europe. By releasing the data and taxonomy, the authors hope to enable new research that benefits agriculture and food systems across borders.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents EuroCrops, a dataset of geo-referenced agricultural crop polygons covering 16 countries across the European Union. The data originates from declarations made by farmers receiving subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Over the past 1.5 years, the authors collected these national datasets, translated the crop labels into English, and mapped them to a newly developed hierarchical crop taxonomy called HCAT. 

The main goal of the dataset is to enable analysis of agricultural diversity and food security across Europe. By harmonizing the data into a common format and taxonomy, researchers can now easily work with cropland data across borders. The authors provide the data publicly on Zenodo, along with documentation on GitHub about the original data sources and mappings to the HCAT taxonomy. This allows the dataset to be extended temporally by linking to additional years of national data. Overall, EuroCrops provides an invaluable data resource for studies of European agriculture across a large spatial extent.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper describes the creation of a large harmonized crop dataset called EuroCrops across 16 countries of the European Union. The authors manually collected geo-referenced crop data from each country, which was scattered across different platforms and servers. They translated the crop names from the national languages into English and mapped them to a newly developed hierarchical taxonomy called HCAT (Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy). HCAT organizes all the crops cultivated in the EU into a common structure. For each country dataset, the original crop names and codes were enriched with the English translations and corresponding HCAT names and codes. The authors validated the harmonized dataset by getting feedback from authorities in the respective countries. The final validated dataset was published as shapefiles on Zenodo with mappings provided on GitHub to allow extension to additional years. Overall, the main method was a manual collection and curation process to harmonize heterogeneous crop data into a common schema to enable agricultural analysis across the European Union.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper presents the EuroCrops dataset, which contains geo-referenced crop data from 16 countries across the European Union. 

- The goal is to provide a large-scale harmonized dataset on crop types and locations across Europe to enable agricultural research and applications across borders. 

- The crop data originates from farmers' self-declarations to receive agricultural subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. 

- The authors collected and integrated these national crop datasets, translated the crop names into English, and mapped them to a new Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) to harmonize the classes.

- EuroCrops enables studying agricultural diversity, crop yield predictions, food security, and other applications using the crop location data combined with satellite imagery or other data sources.

- It addresses the lack of large-scale standardized reference data on crop types and locations, which limits agricultural research and applications.
