# [Function Class Learning with Genetic Programming: Towards Explainable   Meta Learning for Tumor Growth Functionals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12510)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting growth of slow-growing tumors like paragangliomas can help determine if/when a patient needs treatment. However, the underlying growth pattern is unknown. 
- Prior work has limitations in the growth models considered or amount of data used.
- Need a way to learn general growth pattern from multiple patient tumor growth data sets.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new concept called "function class learning" to learn a parametrized function class that captures general growth pattern but can be specialized to each patient's data.
- Propose Function Class GOMEA (FC-GOMEA), a genetic programming approach, to evolve the function class. It uses:
  - GP-GOMEA to evolve the general function class structure
  - Introduces new "function class constant" terminal optimized per patient 
  - Uses RV-GOMEA to optimize constants
- Enables learning multiple diverse function classes in one run.
- Uses a variety of optimizations to reduce computational cost.

Contributions:
- First method to learn a functional (function that returns a function) over multiple related data sets rather than separate models.
- New concept of "function class learning" for interpretable meta-learning.
- FC-GOMEA approach combining genetic programming and real-valued optimization.
- Evaluation on synthetic and real tumor growth data sets demonstrates ability to recover ground truth and learn clinically relevant growth models.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel function class learning concept and FC-GOMEA method to learn interpretable growth models from multiple tumor data sets. This helps explain general growth patterns while still customizing predictions for individual patients.
