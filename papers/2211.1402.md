# [Flashlights: An Off-Caustic Lensed Star at Redshift $z$ = 1.26 in Abell   370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.1402)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses that this paper investigates are:1. What is the nature of the transient object detected in the lensed arc at redshift z=1.2567 in the galaxy cluster Abell 370?2. Could this transient be a highly magnified lensed star undergoing a microlensing event?3. What constraints can be placed on the properties of this transient, such as its luminosity, color, duration, etc. based on the observational data? 4. Can the characteristics of this transient rule out or favor certain interpretations, such as it being a luminous blue variable, nova, or lensed star?5. If this transient is a lensed star, what does that imply about the ability to detect more such events with current and future observatories like Hubble and JWST?6. How well do different lens models of Abell 370 predict the location and properties of this transient?7. Can the presence of this transient, if it is a lensed star, provide insights into dark matter substructure and microlensing in galaxy clusters?In summary, the paper is focused on understanding the nature of this transient through observational constraints and lensing models, determining if it can plausibly be explained as a lensed star, and exploring the implications if that interpretation is correct. The detection of similar offset lensed stars could provide a new probe of dark matter and microlensing effects in galaxy clusters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It reports the discovery of a transient source in a strongly lensed arc at redshift z=1.2567 in the galaxy cluster Abell 370. The transient was detected in Hubble Space Telescope images taken as part of the "Flashlights" program. - The transient is located about 0.6 arcseconds away from the critical curve of the cluster lens model, farther than other previously detected lensed stars which were within 0.2-0.3 arcseconds. This results in a more modest magnification of around 45x.- Analysis of the lightcurve and colors of the transient seem to rule out other possibilities like luminous blue variables, novae, or kilonovae. The authors argue the transient is most likely a lensed massive O or B type star in the source galaxy being microlensed as it crosses a caustic. - If confirmed as a lensed star, this would be the first example detected clearly offset from the critical curve location. The authors suggest this may hint at significant dark matter substructure at the location magnifying the star.- Overall, this transient demonstrates lensed stars can be detected even with more modest magnifications farther from the critical curves than previously seen. This implies a much larger area around critical curves could reveal lensed stars, so many more should be discovered in ongoing surveys with Hubble and James Webb.In summary, the key contribution is the discovery and analysis of this unique transient, which provides evidence for the possibility of detecting lensed stars offset from critical curves and hints at the ability to probe dark matter substructure this way.
