# [Flashlights: An Off-Caustic Lensed Star at Redshift $z$ = 1.26 in Abell   370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.1402)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses that this paper investigates are:1. What is the nature of the transient object detected in the lensed arc at redshift z=1.2567 in the galaxy cluster Abell 370?2. Could this transient be a highly magnified lensed star undergoing a microlensing event?3. What constraints can be placed on the properties of this transient, such as its luminosity, color, duration, etc. based on the observational data? 4. Can the characteristics of this transient rule out or favor certain interpretations, such as it being a luminous blue variable, nova, or lensed star?5. If this transient is a lensed star, what does that imply about the ability to detect more such events with current and future observatories like Hubble and JWST?6. How well do different lens models of Abell 370 predict the location and properties of this transient?7. Can the presence of this transient, if it is a lensed star, provide insights into dark matter substructure and microlensing in galaxy clusters?In summary, the paper is focused on understanding the nature of this transient through observational constraints and lensing models, determining if it can plausibly be explained as a lensed star, and exploring the implications if that interpretation is correct. The detection of similar offset lensed stars could provide a new probe of dark matter and microlensing effects in galaxy clusters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It reports the discovery of a transient source in a strongly lensed arc at redshift z=1.2567 in the galaxy cluster Abell 370. The transient was detected in Hubble Space Telescope images taken as part of the "Flashlights" program. - The transient is located about 0.6 arcseconds away from the critical curve of the cluster lens model, farther than other previously detected lensed stars which were within 0.2-0.3 arcseconds. This results in a more modest magnification of around 45x.- Analysis of the lightcurve and colors of the transient seem to rule out other possibilities like luminous blue variables, novae, or kilonovae. The authors argue the transient is most likely a lensed massive O or B type star in the source galaxy being microlensed as it crosses a caustic. - If confirmed as a lensed star, this would be the first example detected clearly offset from the critical curve location. The authors suggest this may hint at significant dark matter substructure at the location magnifying the star.- Overall, this transient demonstrates lensed stars can be detected even with more modest magnifications farther from the critical curves than previously seen. This implies a much larger area around critical curves could reveal lensed stars, so many more should be discovered in ongoing surveys with Hubble and James Webb.In summary, the key contribution is the discovery and analysis of this unique transient, which provides evidence for the possibility of detecting lensed stars offset from critical curves and hints at the ability to probe dark matter substructure this way.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research on gravitational lensing of stars:- This paper reports the discovery of a new candidate lensed star in the galaxy cluster Abell 370. Several other lensed stars have been discovered in recent years, but this is one of the first found significantly offset from the critical curve of the cluster lens. - Most other lensed stars have been discovered very near (within 0.2-0.3") the critical curve, where magnification is extremely high. This candidate is offset by ~0.6", resulting in more modest magnification. The authors argue an offset star still seems plausible with microlensing by cluster stars.- Analysis of the light curve and colors constrain the source to be consistent with a possible luminous O/B star, similar to other candidates. The short timescale excludes sources like novae or kilonovae.- If confirmed as a lensed star, the larger offset would suggest such events may be more common than expected, and could provide clues about dark matter substructure. Most models don't predict offsets this large.- This detection relied on Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Flashlights program. Other detections have also primarily used HST. The coming James Webb Space Telescope will enable more systematic searches for lensed stars.- Statistics on lensed stars can reveal information about the stellar mass function at high redshift and cluster dark matter properties. This adds another candidate to help build up those statistics.In summary, this paper provides a new lensed star candidate with some unique properties compared to others, and helps demonstrate these events may be more common across a wider area than predicted around cluster lenses. More examples will help unlock details about dark matter, high-z stars, and cosmic microlensing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Detecting more off-critical-curve lensed stars in galaxy clusters with Hubble and JWST. The authors suggest that finding more examples of lensed stars with offsets like the one reported in this paper will help constrain the amount and properties of dark matter substructure in clusters. - Using the frequency and amplitudes of microlensing peaks to constrain the microlens surface density and mass function in galaxy clusters. This can reveal information on the fraction of compact dark matter.- Looking for microlensing peaks far from macrocritical curves (e.g. 1 arcsec away) as a signature of subhalo lensing. The presence of massive subhalos near the line of sight can boost microlensing effects.- Studying the size and color evolution of lensed stars at high redshift to learn about stellar populations and their environments in the early universe. JWST will enable more detailed studies.- Using the transverse velocity measured from lensed stars to constrain lens models. The velocity combines information about the lens and source redshifts and geometry.- Exploring whether interference effects from wave-like dark matter can affect lensing on small scales and lead to offsets like the one observed.In summary, the authors advocate for more systematic surveys to find larger samples of offset lensed stars, in order to use microlensing as a probe of dark matter, stellar astrophysics, and cosmography. JWST will dramatically expand the discovery space for these rare events.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper reports the discovery of a transient seen in a strongly lensed arc at redshift z=1.2567 in Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster, as part of the Flashlights program. The transient was detected at 29.51±0.14 AB mag in a WFC3/UVIS F200LP difference image and is also visible in the F350LP band. Compared to previous examples of lensed stars, it lies at a larger distance (≥0.6”) from the critical curve, yielding a lower magnification, but simulations show that bright O/B-type supergiants can reach high enough magnifications to be seen. The observed transient image has a time delay of ~0.8 days from its expected counterpart, so any transient lasting longer should also be seen on the other side, ruling out candidates like kilonovae. Together with the blue color measured, this makes a lensed star the prime candidate. If so, many more such events should be found in upcoming Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope surveys.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper reports the discovery of a transient seen in a strongly lensed arc at redshift z=1.2567 in Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The transient was detected at a magnitude of 29.5 AB mag in a difference image made using observations from two different epochs taken about a year apart. It was also visible at 30.53 AB mag in a second filter. Compared to other previously observed lensed stars, this transient lies further away from the critical curve, resulting in a lower magnification. However, simulations show that bright O/B-type supergiants can still reach sufficiently high magnifications to be seen. In addition, the transient is a trailing image with a time delay of ~0.8 days, meaning any event lasting longer should also be seen on the other side of the critical curve. This, together with the measured blue color, rules out most other transient candidates like novae and makes a lensed star the prime candidate. If it is a lensed star, it implies many more should soon be detected in cluster surveys with Hubble and JWST.In more detail, the paper discusses the Hubble imaging data and photometry used to detect the transient, and the different lens models of Abell 370. It then analyzes the possible nature of the transient, ruling out a luminous blue variable star, nova or kilonova based on the time delay constraint and color. It shows that an O/B-type supergiant star lensed by microlenses in the cluster is the most likely explanation, and that the measured offset from the critical curve, while larger than past examples, is possible with sufficient stellar density. This detection far from the critical curve, if indeed a lensed star, implies a large area where such events can occur and many more should be found in ongoing and future surveys.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper reports the discovery of a transient source detected in Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the galaxy cluster Abell 370. The transient was found in difference images made with the WFC3/UVIS F200LP and F350LP filters between two observation epochs separated by about a year, as part of the Flashlights program. The transient's position is offset about 0.6" from the critical curve near a lensed arc at redshift 1.25. The authors analyze the light curve at this position using archival Hubble Frontier Field data and find no significant variability, ruling out variable sources like LBVs on timescales longer than the time delay between the two Flashlights epochs (0.8 days). Considering the color and brief allowed duration, the authors conclude the transient is most likely a distant star briefly magnified by microlensing as it crosses a microcaustic. The paper estimates the microlensing parameters needed to produce such an event and the resulting predicted rate, indicating more such offset microlensing events may be uncovered in coming Hubble and JWST surveys.
