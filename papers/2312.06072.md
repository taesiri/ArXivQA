 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel dynamic interactive learning framework for automated 3D medical image segmentation. The framework integrates interactive segmentation with end-to-end weakly supervised learning to address challenges such as high annotation costs and model iteration latency. It uses a multi-round interactive segmentation module that simultaneously optimizes front-end segmentation predictions and the deep learning segmenter. In each round, a 3D "proxy mask" propagated from sparse user inputs serves as weak supervision to enable knowledge distillation from the unknown ground truth labels. The trained segmenter guides the next round's user interventions based on a spatial residual map between consecutive front/back-end predictions. Additionally, the framework employs replay and label smoothing techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and improve online learning robustness when dealing with streaming tasks. Experiments on multi-round interactive segmentation and dynamic evaluation demonstrate competitive performance to benchmarks while requiring substantially less annotation effort. The flexible and responsive nature also makes the framework suitable for deployment within hospital firewalls to ensure data security. Through both technical novelty and practical utility, this work provides valuable insights on integrating interactivity into medical image analysis.
