# [Spectral Meets Spatial: Harmonising 3D Shape Matching and Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18920)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
3D shape matching and interpolation are two fundamental problems in computer vision and graphics. They are highly interrelated, yet prior works mainly consider them separately and apply them sequentially to relate different shapes. As a result, they often lead to suboptimal performance for both tasks. Shape matching methods solely based on spectral domain fail to provide accurate and smooth correspondences. Shape interpolation methods relying on local geometric priors cannot capture both pose and shape dominant deformations.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the first unsupervised learning framework that harmonizes spectral and spatial maps to enable joint 3D shape matching and interpolation. 

The key ideas are:
1) Combine spectral maps (functional maps) and spatial maps (point-wise maps) to enable accurate and smooth correspondences for shape matching. This is achieved by enforcing coupling between functional maps and point-wise maps.

2) Introduce a shape interpolation module that predicts interpolation trajectories by deforming the source shape into the target shape. Spatial regularization based on as-rigid-as-possible energy and symmetry is imposed to avoid trivial solutions.  

3) Propose a novel test-time adaptation approach that captures both pose and shape dominant deformations. This is done by optimizing for an additional shape-based deformation between interpolated shapes from both directions.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to fuse spectral and spatial maps for joint unsupervised 3D shape matching and interpolation
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on numerous datasets, outperforming even supervised methods
- Predicts both pose and shape dominant deformations, unlike prior works that focus mainly on pose
- Demonstrates potential for statistical shape modeling on real-world medical data

The framework harmonizes the advantages of spectral and spatial domains to overcome limitations of prior works. Experiments show improved accuracy for matching, better interpolation trajectories, and the ability to jointly perform both tasks in an unsupervised manner.
