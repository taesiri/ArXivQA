# [DiffusionTalker: Personalization and Acceleration for Speech-Driven 3D   Face Diffuser](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16565)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DiffusionTalker, a novel diffusion-based method for efficiently generating personalized 3D facial animations from speech. The key innovation is the introduction of learnable identity embeddings that capture individual speaking styles. These embeddings are trained using contrastive learning to match input audio features, enabling the model to synthesize animations reflecting personalized talking characteristics. To accelerate inference, DiffusionTalker employs knowledge distillation, distilling a teacher model with more sampling steps into a student model with fewer steps while retaining performance. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art quantitative results on facial animation datasets BEAT and VOCASET. Qualitative evaluations also showcase DiffusionTalker's ability to produce diverse and personalized animations. The method provides an efficient and high-fidelity approach to speech-driven facial animation that captures individual nuances in talking style. Key components include the contrastive identity embeddings, distillation framework, and diffusion-based generative modeling. The work has significant potential for applications in gaming, VR/AR, and digital human rendering.
