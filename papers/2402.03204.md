## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 5G networks are expected to be denser, leading to a large increase in energy consumption. Base stations (BSs) consume about 80% of a network's energy.
- There is a need for energy-efficient techniques to deploy sustainable 5G green networks.
- Jointly deciding on BS sleep mode management and configuration of antenna elements in a multi-cell environment with dynamic traffic remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
- A multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is proposed to minimize the total energy consumption of multiple massive MIMO BSs in a multi-cell network while preserving quality-of-service (QoS).
- The problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) to enable collaboration between BSs to tackle inter-cell interference.
- A multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is designed to learn a collaborative BS control policy for antenna switching and multi-level advanced sleep mode management.
- A modified version called MAPPO-neighbor is proposed to enhance scalability by simplifying the observation space.

Main Contributions:
- Development of a 5G network simulation environment mimicking real mobile traffic patterns.
- Design of a MAPPO algorithm for multi-agent BS control to cooperatively optimize energy efficiency and QoS.
- Demonstration via simulations that the proposed algorithm reduces power consumption by 8.7% (vs. auto sleep mode 1) during low traffic and improves energy efficiency by 19% during high traffic.
- Proposition of a MAPPO-neighbor policy to improve scalability for larger networks.

In summary, this paper addresses the important problem of energy-efficient management of 5G networks. It proposes a novel MARL-based solution for joint configuration of sleep modes and antenna elements across multiple BSs to minimize power consumption while maintaining service quality. Through extensive simulations, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated.
