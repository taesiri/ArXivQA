# [InstructAny2Pix: Flexible Visual Editing via Multimodal Instruction   Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing image editing methods have limited controllability, requiring specific inputs they are trained on (e.g. depth, edge maps) or only allowing simple text instructions (e.g. "add a dog"). 
- They cannot handle complex, multi-modal, multi-object instructions involving images, audio, and text.

Proposed Solution - InstructAny2Pix:
- A flexible system for editing images based on complex multi-modal instructions.
- Brings together capabilities of a multi-modal encoder, language model, and diffusion model.

Key Components:
- Multi-modal encoder: Encodes images, audio into unified latent space.
- Instruction following multi-modal LLM: Understands instructions with multi-modal input, generates output embedding.
- Refinement prior module: Enhances quality of LLM embeddings.  
- Diffusion model: Generates edited image conditioned on LLM embedding.

Training:
- Curate diverse dataset of 500K multi-modal edit instructions.
- Train components separately for efficiency. LLM predicts edited image embedding, diffusion model generates image.

Main Contributions:
- Handles instructions no previous work can, e.g. "add [sound] to [image]", "change style of [image A] to [image B]".
- Eliminates need for iterative chain of edits for complex instructions.
- Achieves strong quantitative and qualitative performance on diverse edit tasks.
- Enables swapping diffusion model without retraining other modules.

In summary, the paper proposes a flexible framework for instruction-based image editing using multi-modal inputs, significantly expanding the scope and complexity of possible editing instructions.
