# [Get the Best of Both Worlds: Improving Accuracy and Transferability by   Grassmann Class Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01547)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether representing classes as subspaces in neural networks can simultaneously improve classification accuracy and feature transferability compared to representing classes as vectors. The key hypotheses appear to be:1. Representing classes as subspaces rather than vectors will improve classification accuracy on large-scale image classification tasks.2. Features learned with subspace class representations will have greater intra-class variability and better transferability to other downstream tasks compared to features learned with vector class representations.The authors propose representing each class as a linear subspace rather than a single vector in the final classifier layer of neural networks. They integrate geometric optimization techniques to learn these subspace representations jointly with other network parameters.Through experiments on ImageNet classification using CNNs and vision transformers, the authors find that subspace class representations improve accuracy over vector representations.The authors also show that subspace representations allow greater intra-class feature variability, which leads to improved transferability on other datasets compared to vector class representations and baselines like softmax loss.In summary, the central hypothesis is that subspace class representations can unlock simultaneous gains in accuracy and transferability over conventional vectors, which is supported by the paper's experiments and results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Grassmann Class Representation (GCR) for image classification. The key ideas are:- Represent each class as a linear subspace (points on the Grassmann manifold) instead of a single vector. The logit for class i is defined as the norm of the projection of the feature vector onto the subspace for class i.- Develop an efficient Riemannian SGD algorithm to jointly optimize the subspaces on the Grassmann manifold together with the other model parameters. - Show through experiments on ImageNet that:  - GCR improves classification accuracy over softmax baseline for various CNN and vision transformer architectures. For example, ResNet50-D top-1 error is reduced by 5.6%.  - Larger subspace dimensions allow greater intra-class feature variability, leading to improved transfer learning performance.  - GCR features transfer better than softmax baseline. For ResNet50-D, average transfer accuracy on 6 datasets improves from 77.98% to 79.70%.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Grassmann class representation to simultaneously improve classification accuracy and feature transferability, enabled by an efficient geometric optimization algorithm. The effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper introduces a novel Grassmann class representation for image classification, where each class is represented by a linear subspace (points on a Grassmann manifold) rather than a single vector. This extends previous works like cosine softmax that used 1D subspaces. - The method integrates geometric optimization techniques like Riemannian SGD to optimize the subspaces jointly with the neural network weights, allowing it to scale to large datasets like ImageNet. This makes it more practical compared to prior works on subspace representations that relied on alternating optimization or pairwise comparisons between subspaces.- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification using ResNet, ResNeXt, Swin Transformer, etc. The gains over softmax baseline are significant, showing the benefits of the subspace representation. This provides a stronger empirical validation on large scale problems compared to related works focusing on smaller datasets.- The paper shows that the subspace representation improves feature transferability to other downstream tasks, while maintaining accuracy on the original task. This helps address the tradeoff between task accuracy vs transferability noted in prior works. The improvement in transfer learning performance is more thoroughly quantified across multiple datasets.- Compared to other methods like that aim to improve feature diversity through multiple prototypes per class, this work shows competitive results by modeling diversity through linear subspaces rather than clusters of points. The subspace formulation also lends itself better to large scale optimization.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions in effectively scaling up and evaluating subspace class representations to challenging large-scale problems like ImageNet classification and transfer learning. The integration of geometric optimization techniques to train the subspaces end-to-end is a noteworthy novelty.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes representing each class as a subspace rather than a vector in neural network classification, which is shown to improve accuracy and feature transferability simultaneously.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring methods to more explicitly promote intra-class variability in the Grassmann class representation. The authors note that their approach allows for greater intra-class feature variability, but does not explicitly maximize it. They suggest combining it with self-supervised learning as one potential way to explicitly drive up intra-class variability.- Studying how to automatically determine the optimal subspace dimension k for the Grassmann class representation. Currently k is treated as a hyperparameter that needs to be set empirically. Developing methods to learn the optimal k would be useful.- Applying the Grassmann class representation to other tasks beyond image classification, such as detection, segmentation, etc. The authors believe the benefits observed for classification and transfer learning will extend more broadly.- Developing more efficient implementations and approximations of the Riemannian SGD algorithm for Grassmann manifolds. This could help reduce the small overhead introduced by the geometric optimization.- Exploring the connections between the subspace dimensionality in GCR and the intrinsic dimensionality of the feature representations. This could provide insight into how GCR works.- Extending the formulation to have a hierarchical or tree structure of subspaces instead of independent subspaces for each class. This could capture relations between classes.- Studying the influence of GCR on adversarial robustness. The subspace representation may impart some robustness properties.In summary, the main suggested directions are developing methods to better take advantage of the flexibility of GCR, finding ways to automate or improve the algorithm, and applying GCR to new domains and tasks beyond classification.
