# [A Collection of Pragmatic-Similarity Judgments over Spoken Dialog   Utterances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There currently exist no measures of "pragmatic similarity" between utterances. Pragmatic similarity refers to the similarity in the overall feeling, tone, and intent of utterances.
- Pragmatic similarity is important for applications like speech synthesis, machine translation, and assessment of learner speech productions. 
- Existing measures focus on semantic or prosodic similarity, but not on pragmatic similarity which captures important aspects of language use in dialog.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop the first collection of human judgments of pragmatic similarity between utterance pairs. 
- Each pair consists of an utterance from recorded dialog, and a "re-enactment" of that utterance under different conditions to create varying degrees of similarity.
- The utterance pairs were rated on a continuous 1-5 scale by 6-9 judges. The average inter-judge correlation reached 0.72 for English and 0.66 for Spanish indicating good consistency.

Main Contributions:
- A carefully designed and tested protocol for obtaining reliable human judgments of pragmatic similarity between utterances.
- Observations on the factors affecting similarity ratings and inter-judge agreements.
- A dataset of over 5,500 human judgments of pragmatic similarity for 693 English and 235 Spanish utterance pairs. This is made freely available to enable further research.
- The judgments can be used to develop computational models for automatically predicting pragmatic similarity, which will benefit applications like speech synthesis, machine translation, dialog systems and assessment of communication skills.

In summary, this paper introduces the problem of modeling pragmatic similarity between spoken utterances, provides a methodology and dataset to enable research in this direction, and discusses insights that can inform future data collection and modeling work on this task.
