# [Frozen in Time: A Joint Video and Image Encoder for End-to-End Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00650)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it seeks to address is: How can we design an end-to-end trainable model for video-text retrieval that takes advantage of both large-scale image and video captioning datasets?

The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question are:

- Proposing a dual encoder model with a transformer-based visual encoder that can handle both images and videos with variable length, allowing flexible joint training on image and video datasets.

- Introducing a curriculum learning strategy that begins with training on images and then gradually learns to attend to increasing temporal context when trained on videos.

- Creating a new large-scale web-scraped video captioning dataset, WebVid-2M, with over 2 million video-text pairs. 

- Achieving state-of-the-art video retrieval results on MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and LSMDC benchmarks, outperforming prior works that use pre-extracted features or pretrain on much larger but noisier datasets like HowTo100M.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that an end-to-end trainable dual encoder model that leverages both images and videos with captions can learn better joint embeddings for video-text retrieval compared to methods relying solely on videos or pre-extracted features. The results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an end-to-end trainable joint image and video encoder model for text-video retrieval. The key ideas are:

- Using a transformer-based architecture with divided space-time attention that can handle both images and videos by treating images as single-frame videos. This allows flexible training on both image and video datasets.

- Designing a curriculum learning strategy that begins with images and then gradually learns to attend to increasing temporal context when trained on video datasets. This increases training efficiency.

- Introducing a new large-scale web-scraped video-text dataset called WebVid-2M with 2.5 million clips for pretraining.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on text-video retrieval benchmarks like MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and LSMDC, outperforming methods that use pre-extracted expert features or pretrain on much larger but noisier datasets like HowTo100M. The model is trained end-to-end without relying on fixed pretrained features.

In summary, the key contribution is an end-to-end trainable transformer-based model for text-video retrieval that can leverage both image and video captioning data and achieves top results with an efficient curriculum training strategy and a new web-scraped pretraining dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable video-text retrieval model that utilizes a flexible transformer architecture to jointly leverage large-scale image and video captioning datasets, and demonstrates state-of-the-art results on downstream benchmarks while training on datasets an order of magnitude smaller than prior work.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in video-text retrieval:

- Architecture: This paper proposes an end-to-end transformer-based architecture for video-text retrieval, unlike prior works that rely on "expert" features from pre-trained models. The unified architecture allows flexible training on both images and videos. Other recent works have used transformers but still relied on expert CNN features.

- Pretraining: The model is pretrained on a new scraped dataset WebVid-2M as well as image caption datasets. This is much smaller than some prior works like Support Set that pretrain on 100M+ clip-text pairs from HowTo100M. The authors argue their data is cleaner and more efficient.

- Training: A key contribution is the curriculum learning strategy that begins with images and gradually increases temporal context. This is more sample efficient than training directly on videos.

- Results: Despite less pretraining data, this model achieves SOTA results on MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and LSMDC. It outperforms methods that use expert features, audio, and even much larger pretrained models.

- Limitations: The model still relies on a decent amount of labelled image data during pretraining. Methods like CLIP show you can do well with just raw Internet images and texts.

Overall, the end-to-end approach without relying on expert features is novel, and the curriculum strategy seems to make training more efficient. The results are quite competitive given the model size and training data. Extending the pretraining to even more raw video data could further improve results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Training on larger video-text datasets: The authors demonstrate performance gains from training on larger datasets, but note their model performance is not yet saturated. They suggest training on the full HowTo100M dataset, even larger image datasets like Google's 3 billion image dataset, and combinations thereof to further improve performance.

- Exploring different model architectures: The authors propose a flexible dual encoder transformer model, but note exploring other architectures for video-text retrieval could be beneficial.

- Multi-modal models: The proposed model uses only the visual modality. The authors suggest incorporating other modalities like audio could improve results.

- Curriculum learning: The authors show benefits from curriculum learning when increasing the number of video frames given as input during training. They suggest exploring other curriculum strategies could be promising.

- Video pretraining for images: The authors show competitive image retrieval results by pretraining solely on video datasets. Further exploring video pretraining for images is suggested.

- Web-scale pretraining: The authors demonstrate strong results can be obtained from models pretrained on web-scraped datasets. Expanding this with more data from the web is suggested as a direction.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling up in terms of data size and model capacity, incorporating multi-modal information, and developing more advanced curriculum training strategies. The flexibility of the model also enables exploration of video pretraining for images and web-scale pretraining.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable model for video-text retrieval that can take advantage of both large-scale image and video captioning datasets. The model uses a transformer architecture applied directly to pixels that allows flexible training on both images and videos by treating images as single frame videos. A curriculum learning strategy is introduced that begins training on images and gradually learns to attend to increasing temporal context when trained on videos. The authors collect a new dataset, WebVid-2M, of over 2 million web videos with captions for pretraining. Despite training on much less data than other methods, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on downstream video-text retrieval benchmarks including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and LSMDC. The model does not rely on pre-extracted 'expert' features as many other methods do. Overall, the work demonstrates the benefit of a unified training framework for images and videos enabled by the transformer architecture.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable model for video-text retrieval that can take advantage of both large-scale image and video captioning datasets. The model consists of a visual encoder based on a transformer architecture that can handle inputs of variable length, allowing it to process both images and videos. This allows the model to be trained on image caption datasets by treating images as single frame videos. The training strategy uses curriculum learning, starting with images only and gradually increasing the number of frames from videos. 

The model achieves state-of-the-art results on several video-text retrieval benchmarks including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and LSMDC. It does this while training on significantly less data than prior work, demonstrating the effectiveness of the joint image-video training. A new dataset called WebVid-2M containing 2 million web videos and captions is also introduced. The work shows the advantages of joint training on images and videos with a flexible transformer architecture, and presents an effective approach for video-text retrieval.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable dual encoder model for video-text retrieval that can be trained on both images and videos jointly. The model consists of a visual encoder based on a transformer architecture with divided space-time attention applied directly to pixels, allowing it to handle both images and videos of variable lengths. The text encoder is a transformer encoder. The model is trained on both large-scale image captioning datasets, by treating images as single frame videos, and video captioning datasets. A curriculum learning strategy is used where training starts with images only and gradually increases the temporal context by increasing the number of input frames over the course of training on videos. This allows the model to efficiently learn from both images and videos in an end-to-end manner without relying on fixed pre-trained feature extractors. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on several video-text retrieval benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of video-text retrieval, where the goal is to learn joint embeddings of video clips and text descriptions to enable efficient text-to-video retrieval. 

Specifically, the paper points out two main challenges in this area:

1) The design of the visual architecture that can effectively encode both images and videos for the retrieval task.

2) The nature of the training data, where large-scale video-text datasets like HowTo100M are noisy, requiring large amounts of compute and scale to handle the noise.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes an end-to-end trainable model based on ViT and Timesformer architectures that can flexibly handle both images and videos using a space-time transformer. The model is trained with a curriculum strategy that gradually learns to attend to temporal information when going from images to videos. The paper also introduces a new large-scale web-scraped video dataset called WebVid-2M to facilitate end-to-end training.

The main contribution is a new state-of-the-art approach for video-text retrieval that does not rely on pre-extracted expert features or large amounts of noisy data, instead training end-to-end on both images and videos jointly. This is enabled by the flexible proposed visual architecture and training curriculum.
