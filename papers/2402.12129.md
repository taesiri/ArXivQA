# [Modified RRT* for Path Planning in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Path planning is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles to navigate optimally in complex and dynamic environments with obstacles. 
- Existing path planning algorithms like potential field methods, RRT, RRT* have issues like getting stuck in local minima, slow convergence to optimal solutions, longer paths, high memory requirements.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a two-stage path planning algorithm called Angle-Based Directed RRT* (AD-RRT*)
- In the first stage, A* algorithm is used for global path planning to decide the overall route from source to destination
- In the second stage, RRT* is modified to do local path planning by restricting the random samples using an angle boundary
- The angle boundary starts from 0 degrees focused on the connectivity region near the source point
- If no path is found initially or time taken is high, the angle is increased to expand search space
- Once path is found, search focuses back on connectivity region

Main Contributions:
- Proposed angle-based detector to quickly find optimal local paths
- Generates shorter paths compared to basic RRT* 
- Lower memory requirements due to fewer nodes
- Effective for complex environments with many obstacles
- Experiments in different scenarios show faster convergence, reduced nodes, time and cost compared to basic RRT*
- Implemented and tested in CARLA autonomous driving simulator

In summary, the key idea is to use a two-stage approach with A* for global planning and a modified bounded RRT* for efficient local planning to find optimal paths in complex environments for autonomous driving. The angle boundary and refocusing search are the main innovations.
