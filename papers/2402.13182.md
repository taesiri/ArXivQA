# [Order-Optimal Regret in Distributed Kernel Bandits using Uniform   Sampling with Shared Randomness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of distributed kernel bandits where N agents aim to collaboratively maximize an unknown reward function f that lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each agent sequentially queries f at different points and receives noisy observations. The agents can communicate through a central server. The goal is to design a collaborative learning algorithm that minimizes the cumulative regret over time T and across agents, while also being communication-efficient. Achieving the optimal regret rate with sublinear communication cost is challenging.

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel algorithm called DUETS (Distributed Uniform Exploration of Trimmed Sets) with two key features:

1. Uniform exploration: Each agent employs uniform random sampling to query points in the current active region, which is compatible with parallel learning and preserves the full learning power. 

2. Shared randomness: Each agent's private coin is known to the server but not other agents. This allows the server to reproduce the query points at no communication cost.

DUETS also uses sparse approximation of GP models to reduce communication of reward observations to a diminishing fraction of total observations. Specifically, the server constructs a global inducing set to approximate posterior statistics and only rewards projected onto this set are communicated.

Main Contributions:
- DUETS achieves optimal regret rate of O(sqrt(NT)) enjoyed by centralized kernel bandits, which matches the lower bound. It is the first algorithm to achieve this for distributed kernel bandits.

- The communication cost of DUETS is sublinear in both number of agents N and time T, which can be much smaller than total queries NT. This significantly improves over prior art.

- DUETS enjoys computational efficiency from uniform sampling and realizes communication reduction through novel integration of shared randomness and sparse approximation.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in closing the gap between distributed and centralized kernel bandits in terms of regret rate with a diminishing communication overhead. The proposed DUETS algorithm is simple, practical and theoretically sound.
