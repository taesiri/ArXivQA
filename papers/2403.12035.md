# [CoCoCo: Improving Text-Guided Video Inpainting for Better Consistency,   Controllability and Compatibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-guided video generation methods face challenges with consistency, controllability, and compatibility. Specifically, they struggle to maintain consistent motion across frames, align generated content with text prompts, and leverage personalized text-to-image (T2I) models. Meanwhile, the field lacks effective techniques for text-guided video inpainting. 

Proposed Solution - CoCoCo:
The paper proposes a novel text-guided video inpainting model called CoCoCo that achieves better consistency, controllability and compatibility. 

The key improvements are:

1) Consistency in Motion: A new motion capture module is introduced with temporal attention blocks from AnimateDiff plus an additional damped global attention block to better preserve motion consistency.

2) Controllability: An instance-aware region selection strategy is used instead of random region selection during training. This aligns masked regions with detected object instances described in the text prompt. A textual cross-attention block is also added to the motion module to enhance text-video alignment.

3) Compatibility: A strategy is introduced to transform personalized T2I models so they are compatible with the video inpainting model. This allows injecting customized T2I checkpoints into CoCoCo to generate personalized visual content.

Main Contributions:

- A new motion capture module with damped global attention to improve motion consistency

- Instance-aware region selection and textual cross-attention to enhance textual controllability

- A strategy to inject personalized T2I models into the video inpainting model to achieve better compatibility

- Overall, the proposed CoCoCo model achieves state-of-the-art text-guided video inpainting with better consistency, controllability and compatibility compared to existing methods.

In summary, the key innovation of CoCoCo is introducing specialized techniques to improve motion, alignment and compatibility for text-guided video inpainting. Experiments validate superiority over other methods in quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new text-guided video inpainting method called CoCoCo that achieves better consistency, controllability, and compatibility by introducing a motion capture module, an instance-aware region selection strategy, and a technique to transform image generation models for compatibility with video inpainting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Improving motion consistency in text-guided video inpainting by proposing a new motion capture module that includes a damped global attention layer and a textual cross-attention layer. 

2. Enhancing textual controllability through an instance-aware region selection strategy for aligning masked regions with text prompts more precisely. This is compared to prior work that uses random region selection.

3. Enabling compatibility with personalized text-to-image models by introducing a simple yet effective strategy to transform such models so they can be injected into the video inpainting model.

In summary, the key innovations of this work are around the 3Cs - improving consistency, controllability and compatibility for text-guided video inpainting. The new motion capture module, instance-aware selection, and model transformation strategy contribute towards these goals.
