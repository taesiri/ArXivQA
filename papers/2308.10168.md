# [Head-to-Tail: How Knowledgeable are Large Language Models (LLM)? A.K.A.   Will LLMs Replace Knowledge Graphs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10168)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Head-to-Tail, a new benchmark for evaluating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) across popular (head), medium-popularity (torso), and rare (tail) facts. The authors generate 18K question-answer pairs across diverse domains, with equal numbers of head/torso/tail instances. They propose automated metrics to assess accuracy and hallucination rates of LLMs and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 representative LLMs. The results demonstrate that current LLMs still have major deficiencies in incorporating factual knowledge, especially for torso and tail entities. The accuracy of even the best models declines sharply from head to tail facts, with only around 20% overall accuracy. The authors conclude that normal techniques like scale increase and prompting do not reliably improve factuality, highlighting the need for more targeted methods. They outline promising directions such as knowledge infusion and retrieval augmentation to combine symbolic knowledge graphs with neural knowledge in LLMs. Overall, this rigorous benchmarking study provides novel insights into the limitations of LLMs' factual knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces Head-to-Tail, the first benchmark focused on comprehensively assessing large language models' ability to incorporate factual knowledge about head, torso, and tail entities; through evaluation, it shows existing LLMs have limitations, especially on tail entities, underscoring the need for more effective approaches to increase their factuality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Head-to-Tail, a new benchmark for assessing how knowledgeable large language models (LLMs) are about factual information, particularly less popular "torso" and "tail" facts. The authors generated 18K question-answer pairs covering different domains and popularity levels. Through comprehensive evaluation of 14 LLMs, they found existing models still lack factual knowledge, especially about non-popular entities. For example, the best models answered only around 30% of questions correctly for the most popular movie entities, with performance declining for less popular facts. The paper proposes new dual neural knowledge graph methods to combine symbolic knowledge with LLMs' implicit knowledge. Overall, it demonstrates current LLMs have significant limitations in their grasp of factual knowledge, necessitating new techniques to improve their factuality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called Head-to-Tail to evaluate how knowledgeable large language models are about facts of varying popularity, finding that their performance declines from head to tail entities and that common techniques like scale increase do not reliably improve factuality.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How knowledgeable are large language models (LLMs) about factual knowledge, particularly regarding head, torso, and tail facts?

The key hypothesis is that LLMs have limited factual knowledge, especially about less popular (torso and tail) entities, despite their impressive capabilities. The paper aims to quantify and characterize the knowledge encoded in LLMs through a new benchmark and evaluation methodology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) Introduction of Head-to-Tail (H2T), the first benchmark focused on comprehensively assessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to incorporate factual knowledge encompassing the head, torso, and tail portions of knowledge graphs.

(ii) Presentation of an evaluation methodology with appropriate metrics to automatically evaluate the factuality of LLMs. The metrics help distinguish between hallucination and missing answers. 

(iii) Comprehensive evaluation and quantification of the factuality of 14 LLMs regarding their grasp of head, torso and tail facts. The analysis shows existing LLMs still have limitations in representing factual knowledge, especially for non-popular torso and tail entities.

In light of these findings, the paper suggests new research directions to seamlessly blend symbolic and neural knowledge representations. The benchmark and analysis help answer key questions around the reliability of LLMs for factual knowledge and whether knowledge graphs will be replaced by LLMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on evaluating factual knowledge in large language models:

- The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, Head-to-Tail (H2T), specifically designed to assess LLMs' grasp of factual knowledge about head (popular), torso, and tail (rare) entities. Most prior work uses existing QA datasets not focused on head/torso/tail coverage.

- The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation across 14 major LLMs using automated metrics like accuracy, hallucination rate, and missing rate. Many prior studies evaluate only 1-2 models manually on a small set of examples. 

- The analysis shows existing LLMs still have significant limitations in factual knowledge, especially for torso/tail entities, despite recent advances. This reinforces findings from some other concurrent work. 

- The study examines the impact of model size, architecture, and instruction tuning, shedding light on what helps/hurts factuality. It finds bigger models and instruction tuning do not reliably improve factuality.

- The authors suggest implications for the future role of knowledge graphs versus implicit knowledge in LLMs. They propose the idea of "Dual Neural KGs" that blend symbolic and neural knowledge representations.

Overall, this paper provides one of the most extensive evaluations of LLMs' factual knowledge to date using a tailored evaluation dataset and automated metrics. The analysis offers new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs regarding different types of facts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the analysis in the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Head knowledge: Since existing LLMs still have low QA accuracy even for popular head entities, an important research direction is to better infuse head knowledge into LLMs through model training or fine-tuning. Early work in this direction includes knowledge infusion methods.

2. Torso-to-tail and recent knowledge: For non-popular torso-to-tail entities and emerging knowledge where training data is sparse, representing the knowledge as symbolic triples may be more suitable. Important research problems include effectively deciding when external knowledge is needed, retrieving relevant knowledge, and integrating it into the LLM's responses. Early attempts involve knowledge-augmented LLMs. 

3. Taxonomy: The authors suggest investigating the effectiveness of LLMs in capturing taxonomic relationships like hypernyms and synonyms, even for fine-grained sub-types. They hypothesize LLMs may be able to learn such taxonomic knowledge well from data.

4. Evaluating more recent LLMs: The authors note they did not evaluate the most recent models like GPT-4 and LLaMA 2, so evaluating these models is suggested.

In summary, the key directions are improving infusion of head knowledge into LLMs, integrating external torso-tail knowledge into LLMs, capturing taxonomy, and benchmarking the latest models. The overall goal is to combine symbolic and neural knowledge representations into "Dual Neural KGs".

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called Head-to-Tail (HN) for evaluating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). What are some key considerations and challenges in designing such a benchmark to effectively cover the head, torso, and tail portions of knowledge graphs?

2. The HN benchmark evaluates LLMs using accuracy, hallucination rate, and missing rate metrics. Why are these suitable metrics for this purpose? What are some limitations or caveats to keep in mind when interpreting the results? 

3. The paper finds that model performance consistently declines from head to tail entities. How might the distribution of training data contribute to this issue? What steps could be taken in model pre-training to improve knowledge of tail entities?

4. The prompting methodology seems important for approximating the knowledge embedded within LLMs. How might changes to the prompt design influence the observed model performance? Are there better ways to query factual knowledge? 

5. The paper argues that increased model scale does not directly translate into improved factual knowledge. Why might this be the case? What other factors besides model size seem to impact the incorporation of factual knowledge?

6. How suitable are the sampled domains (movies, books, academics) for evaluating general factual knowledge? Could the benchmark be expanded or adapted to cover additional domains?

7. The paper focuses on simple factual questions, but how might LLMs perform on more complex, inferential questions? Could the benchmark be expanded to assess reasoning skills too?

8. The accuracy results suggest LLMs still have significant gaps in factual knowledge. How might this impact real-world applications? In what situations could poor factual grounding lead to problems?

9. How might the knowledge gaps identified in this analysis be addressed? What approaches could improve the breadth and depth of LLMs' factual knowledge? 

10. The paper presents an vision for "Dual Neural KGs" that combine symbolic and subsymbolic knowledge representations. What are some research problems and practical challenges that must be addressed to realize this vision?
