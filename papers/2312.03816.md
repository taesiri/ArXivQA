# [AVID: Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03816)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of text-guided video inpainting. Given an input video, a masked region in the first frame indicating the area to edit, and a text prompt describing the desired modification, the goal is to generate a new video that fills in the masked region across all frames according to the text prompt, while keeping the area outside the mask unchanged. This is a very useful but challenging video editing task. 

Main challenges:
1) Maintaining temporal consistency of the edited region across frames.
2) Supporting different types of edits like object swaps, retexturing, uncropping etc. which require different degrees of retaining structure from original video. 
3) Handling videos of arbitrary lengths.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework called AVID - Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Models. The key components are:

1) Base architecture: Built on top of a text-to-image inpainting diffusion model which is inflated to process multiple frames and integrated with motion modules to ensure temporal consistency.

2) Structure guidance module: To control the structural fidelity from original video depending on the editing type. This is a learned conditional control network.

3) Inference pipeline: A novel Temporal MultiDiffusion technique to handle variable length videos by segmenting video into overlapping clips and aggregating results. Further improves consistency across clips using a middle-frame attention guidance method.

Main Contributions:
1) Integrating motion modules in diffusion-based text-guided video inpainting model for better temporal consistency.

2) Proposing a controllable structure guidance module to support diverse editing types and structure retention needs.

3) A zero-shot inference pipeline to handle videos of arbitrary lengths using Temporal MultiDiffusion and middle-frame attention guidance.

The method is shown to robustly handle different editing types like object swaps, retexturing, uncropping over variable duration videos in a temporally consistent manner.
