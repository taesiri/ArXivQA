# [Discovering modular solutions that generalize compositionally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many complex tasks and environments have underlying compositional structure that can be leveraged to enable rapid adaptation and compositional generalization. However, most powerful learning systems today struggle to compose flexibly.
- While monolithic architectures lack built-in modularity, modular architectures often collapse to monolithic solutions in practice. It's unclear when modular systems can discover compositional structure purely from observations. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors set up a teacher-student framework where the teacher is a modular hypernetwork with full control over the ground truth modules and their composition. This allows formulating compositional generalization as a module identification problem.
- They show theoretically that in the infinite data limit, the student can identify the teacher modules up to linear transformation without needing to observe all exponential combinations, if the training distribution has compositional and connected support.
- Empirically, they demonstrate how meta-learning from finite samples can discover modular solutions that generalize compositionally in modular but not monolithic architectures.

Main Contributions:
- A theoretical characterization relating compositional generalization to parameter identification in a modular teacher-student setting. Identifiability requires the training distribution to have compositional and connected support.
- An extensive empirical study demonstrating that meta-learning can discover modular solutions that compositionally generalize in hypernetworks but not in monolithic architectures across a teacher-student setting as well as more realistic compositional preference and goal environments.
- Insights that modular architectures can capture nonlinear latent structure through linear parameter combinations.
- Evidence that the theoretically identified properties of compositional and connected support are crucial for compositional generalization beyond the teacher-student setting.

In summary, the paper sheds light on when and how modular architectures can discover hidden compositional structure purely from observations to achieve compositional generalization.
