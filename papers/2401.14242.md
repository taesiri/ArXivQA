# [Improving Natural Language Capability of Code Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Code large language models (Code LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in code generation. However, most existing works focus on enhancing programming abilities while neglecting natural language understanding abilities. 
- The ability to comprehend natural language descriptions is critical for generating correct code. 
- Experiments show code LLMs exhibit varying performance across languages, indicating a need to improve multi-lingual capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- A framework comprising two modules - AttentionExtractor and AttentionCoder
- AttentionExtractor uses NLP tools to extract key phrases (Attention) from natural language description. 
- AttentionCoder incorporates the extracted Attention when prompting Code LLMs to generate code, helping them focus on pivotal information.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an effective framework to enhance code LLMs' natural language comprehension by integrating with traditional NLP analysis tools.
- Crafts a multi-lingual benchmark, MultiNL-H, covering code tasks in 5 languages to evaluate models thoroughly.
- Experiments demonstrate the framework consistently improves various Code LLMs across languages. Up to 10.37% absolute gain on Chinese tasks.
- Analysis provides insights - phrase-level Attention works best; performance improves as Attention count increases. 
- Framework exhibits transferability to other NLP tasks involving natural language context.

In summary, the paper pioneers improving Code LLMs' natural language abilities by highlighting critical information, and provides a new direction via integrating LLMs with traditional NLP tools. The proposed solution and benchmark advance multi-lingual code generation research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework comprising AttentionExtractor and AttentionCoder modules to improve code language models' natural language capabilities by extracting and highlighting key phrases from task descriptions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a simple yet effective framework, composed of the AttentionExtractor and AttentionCoder modules, to boost the code generation capabilities of code LLMs across multiple natural languages. 

2. Crafting a new benchmark, namely MultiNL-H, which extends the HumanEval (English) benchmark into four other natural languages (Chinese, French, Spanish, and Japanese). This benchmark can evaluate the code generation capabilities of code LLMs from the perspective of natural languages.

3. Performing extensive experiments to prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, as well as deriving some valuable insights. The results show that the framework can consistently improve the performance of various code LLMs across different natural languages.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework to enhance code LLMs' natural language understanding ability by integrating them with traditional NLP analysis tools, as well as constructing a multi-lingual benchmark and conducting comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an AttentionExtractor module to extract key phrases from natural language requirements. What are some limitations of the current implementation? How can the phrase extraction be improved or made more robust?

2. The AttentionCoder module uses the extracted key phrases to guide code generation. But how does it balance focusing on these phrases vs. the overall context? Could attention to these phrases sometimes be detrimental? 

3. The paper shows performance across 5 languages. But could the approach work for a wider range of languages, including low-resource ones? What adaptations would be needed?

4. The ablation study explores attention granularity, ranking algorithms, etc. What other key factors could impact the performance of the proposed framework?

5. The paper hypothesizes that the approach helps reduce cognitive load for models. Is there any way to more directly test this hypothesis? 

6. How suitable is the approach for long, complex code generation tasks? Could attention phrases help or hinder in very long contexts?

7. The case study highlights improved attention to return types. In what other ways does the approach demonstrably improve code generation?

8. Could the AttentionExtractor and AttentionCoder modules be integrated into model architecture and training rather than just prompting? What challenges would this entail?

9. The paper focuses on code generation, but could similar principles apply to other code intelligence tasks like bug fixing, documentation generation, etc?

10. The approach shows transferability to other tasks. In what areas or applications could it have the most impact beyond those demonstrated? What adaptations would be needed?
