# [EMQ: Evolving Training-free Proxies for Automated Mixed Precision   Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10554)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we efficiently and automatically search for training-free proxies to predict the performance of different bit-width configurations for mixed-precision quantization, without requiring extensive expert knowledge or trial-and-error tuning?The key hypothesis appears to be: By representing the search space of possible proxies as branched computation graphs and using an evolution algorithm with specialized techniques like diversity-prompting selection and compatibility screening, it is possible to automatically evolve high-quality proxies that strongly correlate with quantization accuracy.In summary, the central focus is on using an automated, training-free approach to discover effective proxies for mixed-precision quantization, rather than relying on hand-crafted heuristics. The authors propose a framework called EMQ to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of MQ-Bench-101, a new benchmark for evaluating training-free proxies for mixed-precision quantization. This benchmark contains 425 randomly sampled bit configurations and their quantization accuracies using post-training quantization on ResNet-18. 2. The proposal of the Evolving proxies for Mixed-precision Quantization (EMQ) framework, which uses an evolution algorithm to automatically search for effective training-free proxies for mixed-precision quantization. The framework involves an elaborate search space, a diversity-prompting selection strategy, and a compatibility screening protocol.3. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrating that the proxy searched by EMQ outperforms existing training-free proxies like SNIP, Synflow, etc. in terms of rank correlation and quantization accuracy. The searched proxy also exhibits a strong positive correlation with quantization accuracy on MQ-Bench-101.4. Ablation studies validating the effectiveness of the proposed diversity-prompting selection strategy and compatibility screening protocol in improving the efficiency of the evolution search process.In summary, the key novelty of this work seems to be the introduction of an automated framework (EMQ) for searching high-quality training-free proxies for mixed-precision quantization, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments and analyses. The MQ-Bench-101 is also presented as a new benchmark to facilitate further research in this direction.
