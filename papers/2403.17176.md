# [Histogram Layers for Neural Engineered Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Histograms are widely used in computer vision and machine learning to aggregate image intensities or feature values. Methods like local binary patterns (LBP) and edge histogram descriptors (EHD) leverage histograms to extract statistical and structural texture features from images. However, these "engineered" histogram features have limitations such as manual tuning of parameters and inability to adapt to data. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn powerful features but cannot capture local statistics well. 

Proposed Method:
This paper proposes neural versions of histogram-based features called neural LBP (NLBP) and neural EHD (NEHD) that can be trained end-to-end to overcome limitations of traditional engineered features while capturing useful local statistics. The key idea is to use convolutional layers to extract structural texture features and histogram layers to aggregate these into statistical texture representations. The structural and statistical parts can be learned jointly.

Contributions:
1) Flexibility to mitigate issues with parameter selection in engineered features  
2) Ability to change feature representation during training to match problem  
3) Combining strengths of statistical and structural texture features  
4) Possibility to discover new useful histogram features during training

Experiments show NLBP and NEHD reconstruct traditional LBP and EHD closely while outperforming them for image classification across benchmark and real-world datasets. The neural features also surpass other LBP variants. The general framework can incorporate other engineered histogram features in future work.
