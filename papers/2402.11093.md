# [Modular Graph Extraction for Handwritten Circuit Diagram Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Existing methods for extracting electrical circuit graphs from hand-drawn raster images lack evaluation on large public datasets, limiting comparative analysis.
- The literature acknowledges the scarcity of public datasets in this field, with authors even creating custom small datasets of 100-150 images.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a modular end-to-end pipeline for extracting graphs from hand-drawn circuit diagrams.
- The solution is evaluated on the CGHD dataset of over 2,400 real-world hand-drawn circuit images with over 200k annotations.
- Individual sub-tasks like object detection, segmentation, orientation regression and text recognition are solved by separate models.
- These models are then integrated to extract a computer-readable circuit graph from the raster image.

Key Contributions:
- Publicly released the large CGHD dataset and annotation tool to advance research.
- Evaluated state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN, U-Net and LSTMs for sub-tasks.  
- Demonstrated an end-to-end graph extraction pipeline on real-world noisy images.
- Established baseline performances on the dataset through extensive experiments.
- Showcased the viability of the modular solution via qualitative results.
- Proposed extensions like model integration and dataset growth as future work.

In summary, the paper makes the CGHD dataset available to facilitate reproducible research in this problem area. It evaluates multiple deep learning models to solve sub-problems that are integrated into an end-to-end graph extraction pipeline. Both the dataset and code are publicly released to serve as a benchmark for schematic diagram understanding.
