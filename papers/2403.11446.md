# [LLM Guided Evolution -- The Automation of Models Advancing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional neural architecture search (NAS) methods like evolutionary algorithms can be inefficient at exploring complex solution spaces. This is partly due to rigid mutation and crossover structures.
- Large language models (LLMs) have reasoning and code generation capabilities that could enhance NAS, but they can sometimes produce erroneous or fabricated responses (hallucinations).

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a "Guided Evolution" (GE) framework that integrates LLMs into the core evolutionary algorithm operations of mutation and mating. 
- Use an "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique where the LLM learns over successive generations by analyzing high-performing individuals from the previous generation. This creates a feedback loop for progressive improvement.
- Employ "Character Role Play" (CRP) during mutation to access more creative areas of the LLM's latent space and generate more diverse, unconventional architectural suggestions. 

Contributions:
- Demonstrate the GE framework evolving the ExquisiteNetV2 image classifier to achieve higher accuracy (up to 93.34%) without increasing model size, outperforming the original model and some state-of-the-art alternatives.
- Show compact GE-evolved variants with Accuracy/Size trade-offs e.g. 43% fewer parameters with 93.16% accuracy.
- Present an ablation study indicating EoT and CRP enhance the quality and efficiency of the guided evolution process.
- Introduce innovations in integrating LLMs with genetic algorithms via EoT and CRP for more intelligent, creative neural architecture search.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel LLM-based guided evolution framework to improve neural architecture search, leveraging evolution of thought and character role play to boost efficiency, accuracy and creativity compared to conventional evolutionary algorithms.
