# [VF-NeRF: Viewshed Fields for Rigid NeRF Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "VF-NeRF: Viewshed Fields for Rigid NeRF Registration":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of rigid registration between two Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Specifically, it considers the setting where two separate sets of images are used to reconstruct two NeRFs, but the camera poses are unknown. The goal is to estimate the 6DoF rigid transformation that best aligns the two NeRFs. This is a challenging problem since NeRFs do not have an explicit 3D representation like point clouds or meshes. 

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to introduce a novel implicit representation called "Viewshed Fields" (VF) that encodes for each 3D point, how likely it is to have been viewed by the original set of cameras used to reconstruct the NeRF. 

The VF is modeled using a normalizing flow to map oriented 3D points (position + viewing direction) to a latent space during NeRF training. By sampling this latent space, novel "good" viewpoints can be generated to produce images from one NeRF that can be matched to the other NeRF.

Specifically, VF is used in three ways:
(1) Generate novel views for photometric matching between NeRFs 
(2) Create 3D point clouds for initialization via point cloud registration
(3) Guide pixel sampling during photometric optimization

By optimizing the 6DoF transform to minimize the photometric difference between rendered views, the two NeRFs can be accurately registered.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of Viewshed Fields (VF), a novel implicit representation that encodes the visibility of 3D points for generating useful views and points

- Generating meaningful novel views by mapping VF to a latent space using normalizing flows and sampling 

- Using VF to construct point clouds for initialization and ray sampling during optimization

- Achieving state-of-the-art NeRF registration results on multiple datasets with different capture modalities

The proposed VF-NeRF approach is simple, efficient, and delivers accurate rigid registration between NeRFs without known camera poses. The VF representation and its uses are the main innovations presented.
