# [Synthesize Step-by-Step: Tools, Templates and LLMs as Data Generators   for Reasoning-Based Chart VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16385)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding data visualizations like charts and plots requires reasoning about both visual elements and numerics. Current chart visual question answering (VQA) models struggle with complex reasoning questions.
- Existing datasets have limited reasoning questions. ChartQA has some human-written complex questions but very few per image. Models achieve only 38% accuracy on these questions. 

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage large language models (LLMs) as automatic data annotators to generate question-answer pairs for chart images. Take advantage of LLMs' strong reasoning ability.
- Key innovation is "Synthesize Step-by-Step" strategy: LLM learns to decompose complex questions into step-by-step sub-questions (rationales), which are then executed using Python to derive the final answer. 
- The step-wise generation is trained on synthetic data from a template-based QA generation pipeline.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel way to utilize LLMs to automatically generate QA annotations for chart images in a step-by-step manner.
- Show the importance of decomposing questions into rationales for better quality data generation.
- Experiments highlight significance of proposed approach - train chart VQA models on LLM-generated data to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. 
- Improve accuracy from 38% to 54% on human-written questions in ChartQA which require reasoning, underscoring potential of synthetic data to improve reasoning ability.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective strategy to leverage LLMs' reasoning ability for data augmentation to improve chart VQA models, especially on complex reasoning questions. The step-by-step decomposition with template-based training is a key innovation.
