## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Enhancing low-light images is challenging due to the lack of detail and edge information in dim images. Traditional methods fail to effectively extract edges from low-light images. Learning strong edge priors from dim images can benefit low-light image enhancement. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an edge-guided Retinex model for low-light image enhancement. The key ideas are:

1) Design an edge extraction network to directly capture fine edge features from low-light images. This is based on a multi-scale residual block backbone.

2) Integrate the learned edge prior into a Retinex model formulated in logarithmic domain for illumination-reflectance decomposition. This results in an edge-guided Retinex model for enhancement.

3) Propose an inertial Bregman alternating linearized minimization algorithm to efficiently solve the edge-guided Retinex model for image enhancement.

Main Contributions:

- Novel edge learning strategy tailored for low-light images to obtain strong edge priors. 

- New edge-guided Retinex formulation for illumination-reflectance decomposition to boost low-light image enhancement.

- Effective inertial Bregman optimization algorithm with convergence guarantees to solve the proposed edge-guided Retinex model.

- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in extracting and utilizing edge information for Retinex-based low-light image enhancement through an elegant model and optimization framework.
