# [Self-Healing Distributed Swarm Formation Control Using Image Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07523)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method for human operators to easily control large robot swarms by specifying a desired two-dimensional formation using a compressed representation called image moments. These image moments, based on orthogonal polynomials, encode distributions with just a few coefficients yet can represent intricate shapes. Each robot estimates the current swarm moments in a distributed, scalable way using only local communication and then moves to try to match the swarm's moments to the desired moments. This drives the swarm to the desired formation shape. The approach is shown to be robust to significant packet loss between robots and allows robots to be added or removed without issue. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for swarms of up to 1000 robots, and hardware experiments with up to 50 small differential-drive robots validate the practicality. The key benefit is that a human can control a large swarm using very few parameters with no need to manage individual robots.
