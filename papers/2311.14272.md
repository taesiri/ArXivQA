# [CRISP: Hybrid Structured Sparsity for Class-aware Model Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14272)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes CRISP, a novel pruning framework for class-aware model personalization that achieves high accuracy while significantly enhancing hardware efficiency. CRISP leverages a unique hybrid structured sparsity pattern combining both fine-grained N:M sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity. An iterative pruning strategy guided by a gradient-based class-aware saliency score selectively eliminates weights less relevant to user-preferred classes. Experiments show CRISP sustains high accuracy comparable to dense models for ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2 across varying numbers of classes on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Additionally, CRISP delivers substantial improvements in hardware efficiency, with up to 14× speedup and 30× energy savings compared to state-of-the-art sparse accelerators. The paper demonstrates CRISP successfully integrates accuracy, efficiency, and personalization within a single specialized framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 CRISP introduces a hybrid structured sparsity framework for class-aware model pruning that combines fine-grained N:M sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity guided by a gradient-based class saliency score to achieve high compression rates while maintaining accuracy across popular CNN models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CRISP, a novel pruning framework for class-aware model personalization. Specifically:

- It introduces a unique hybrid structured sparsity pattern that combines both fine-grained N:M sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity to achieve high compression rates while maintaining model accuracy. 

- It proposes an iterative pruning strategy guided by a gradient-based class-aware saliency score to eliminate weights not crucial for user-specific classes.

- It achieves high accuracy comparable to dense models for ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2 with over 90% sparsity across the three models.

- The resulting pruned models exhibit up to 14x speedup and 30x energy efficiency improvements compared to existing pruning methods, making them suitable for efficient deployment on edge devices.

In summary, the key contribution is a specialized pruning framework called CRISP that can tailor universal models to focus only on classes relevant to individual users, enhancing efficiency for edge device deployment.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hybrid structured sparsity pattern that combines both fine-grained N:M sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity. Can you explain in detail the motivation behind using this hybrid approach instead of relying solely on either fine-grained or coarse-grained sparsity? What are the advantages of this hybrid technique?

2. The paper mentions two critical hardware overheads that are considered in the proposed sparse pattern - load balancing and metadata storage. Can you elaborate on what each of these refers to and why they are important considerations in hardware accelerator design? 

3. The pruning metric used in this method is called the Class-aware Saliency Score (CASS). Can you explain how this score is calculated and what aspects of weight importance it aims to capture? Walk through each of the three relative weight importance criteria.

4. Explain in detail the process of coarse-grained block pruning used in this method. In particular, focus on explaining the steps of calculating pruning scores for each block, sorting within rows, aggregating column-wise, and finally selecting blocks to prune based on target sparsity. 

5. The paper utilizes an iterative pruning approach over multiple steps rather than aggressive one-shot pruning. Can you discuss the motivation for this strategy and how it helps prevent model degradation and layer collapse?

6. Discuss the accelerator-level hardware design introduced in this paper called CRISP-STC. How does it build upon and customize Nvidia's Sparse Tensor Core design for edge devices? What are some of the key optimizations?

7. Explain the three main steps involved in sparse matrix multiplication on the proposed CRISP-STC hardware. In particular, focus on elucidating the activation selection unit and its role in compression/decompression.  

8. Why does the paper evaluate performance of the method on multiple models like ResNet, VGGNet, and MobileNetV2? What differences might we expect to see across these models in terms of pruning ability?

9. The paper compares against multiple baseline methods for structured pruning like OCAP and CAPNN. What are some weaknesses of these methods that the proposed technique attempts to address?

10. One of the biggest advantages claimed is significant improvements in latency and energy efficiency over dense models. Can you explain what hardware-level optimizations make these speed ups and efficiency gains possible?
