# [NEMTO: Neural Environment Matting for Novel View and Relighting   Synthesis of Transparent Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, this paper focuses on the problem of modeling and rendering transparent 3D objects with unknown refractive indices. The key hypotheses/questions it addresses are:

1) Can we develop an end-to-end neural rendering pipeline that can model both the complex geometry and appearance of transparent objects for tasks like novel view synthesis and relighting? 

2) Can we design a neural network module to better handle light refraction through the object compared to analytical/physics-based methods? This is critical as small geometry errors can significantly impact rendered views.

3) Can we leverage implicit neural representations like SDFs to model the geometry and a ray bending network for refractive effects to achieve high quality rendering without knowing the object's refractive index?

4) Will the proposed approach generalize well to real captured data of transparent objects compared to existing methods that often rely on controlled capture or synthesized training data?

In summary, the main research goals are developing an end-to-end neural approach for modeling and rendering transparent objects that can handle complex geometry, unknown refractive indices, and real world data by combining implicit geometry networks with a learned ray bending module for refraction. Key hypotheses are that this will improve over analytical refractive models and generalize better than existing learning-based methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an end-to-end neural rendering pipeline called NEMTO to model and render novel views and relighting of 3D transparent objects with complex geometry and unknown refractive indices. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Leveraging implicit SDFs to model the complex geometry of transparent objects.

- Proposing a Ray Bending Network (RBN) to model light refraction through the object by directly mapping input ray directions to output refracted ray directions. This is more tolerant to geometric inaccuracies than analytical refraction models.

- An end-to-end differentiable rendering module that combines reflected and refracted radiance based on Fresnel equations. 

- Demonstrating high quality novel view synthesis and relighting on both synthetic and real transparent objects, outperforming prior neural rendering techniques.

The main significance is developing an end-to-end learnable pipeline to model transparent objects with complex and unknown properties. This is useful for rendering transparent objects in mixed reality and other applications. The RBN in particular helps disentangle geometry from refractive appearance, improving performance over analytical models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes NEMTO, an end-to-end neural rendering pipeline to model transparent 3D objects with complex geometry and unknown refractive indices for high-quality novel view and relighting synthesis, using implicit functions to represent geometry and a physically-guided ray bending network to disentangle object shape and light refraction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel end-to-end neural rendering approach for modeling and rendering transparent 3D objects with complex geometry. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work:

- Most prior work either assumes known object geometry and refractive indices, or uses controlled capture setups like turntables and structured lighting. This method requires only casual multi-view captures under natural illumination.

- It represents object geometry with implicit SDFs rather than explicit meshes. This allows modeling complex geometry adaptively. 

- It introduces a Ray Bending Network to predict light refraction through the object, instead of using analytical refraction models. This is more robust to geometric errors.

- It disentangles geometry and appearance better than prior neural rendering techniques like NeRF and PhySG. This allows higher quality novel view synthesis and relighting. 

- It places no constraints on light bounces within the object, unlike recent work that assumes two bounces. This enables handling more complex light transport effects.

- It requires no known refractive index, unlike some analytical methods. The network learns an implicit "index" to match refractions.

- It demonstrates results on both synthetic and real captured data. Most analytical methods are limited to synthetic data.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundary of neural rendering of transparent objects. It removes many constraints of analytical methods and prior learning techniques. The proposed approach produces higher quality rendering for this very challenging problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing methods to handle heterogeneous transparent objects with non-uniform indices of refraction (IOR). The current method assumes homogeneous IOR, so extending it to handle varying IOR throughout an object could broaden its applicability. The authors suggest using loss functions like those from eikonal rendering to supervise modeling of heterogeneous transparent media.

- Jointly optimizing illumination along with geometry and appearance for transparent objects. Currently the method requires preprocessing the input images to estimate environment illumination and object masks. Being able to jointly optimize all these factors could make the method more widely usable. 

- Applying the method to polarized transparent objects and materials. The current approach focuses on unpolarized light transmission, but expanding it to handle polarized light could increase its capabilities.

- Improving runtime performance. The authors note that the current method can be slow for high-resolution imaging. Speeding up the model computation could make it more practical for real-time applications.

- Generalizing the approach to handle multiple transparent objects and more complex transparent scene geometry. The current method works for a single transparent object - extending it to full transparent scenes could increase its utility.

- Reducing the amount of training data required. The method may benefit from exploring ways to train on less input data while preserving synthesis quality.

So in summary, the main future work suggested is developing extensions to handle more complex transparent object properties, scenes, and data constraints, along with improving the computational efficiency of the model. The goal would be to increase the applicability and robustness of the method for real-world transparent object and scene modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NEMTO, the first end-to-end neural rendering pipeline to model 3D transparent objects with complex geometry and unknown indices of refraction. Traditional appearance modeling methods like Disney BSDF cannot accurately handle transparent objects due to the complex light paths bending through refractions and the strong dependency of surface appearance on illumination. NEMTO takes 2D images of a transparent object as input and is capable of high-quality novel view and relighting synthesis. It uses implicit Signed Distance Functions to model object geometry and a novel refraction-aware ray bending network to model light refraction within the object. This ray bending network is more robust to geometric inaccuracies than traditional physically-based rendering of transparent objects. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating high-quality results and the applicability of the approach. Key strengths are the ability to handle complex geometry, unknown refractive indices, and natural illumination while disentangling geometry and illumination-dependent appearance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NEMTO, a novel end-to-end neural rendering pipeline to model 3D transparent objects with complex geometry and unknown refractive indices. Existing appearance modeling techniques like the Disney BSDF model cannot accurately handle transparent objects due to the complex light paths bending through refractions and the strong coupling between surface appearance and illumination. NEMTO takes 2D images of a transparent object as input and is capable of high-quality novel view and relighting synthesis. It leverages implicit Signed Distance Functions to represent object geometry and proposes a refraction-aware ray bending network to model light refraction within the object. This ray bending network is more robust to geometric inaccuracies than traditional physically-based rendering of transparent objects. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate NEMTO's ability to generate high-quality results and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

In more detail, NEMTO disentangles geometry and illumination-dependent appearance through its ray bending network, unlike previous neural rendering techniques. It incorporates a ray bending network to decouple object geometry and light refraction, taking the estimated geometry as a prior. This network maps the incoming ray direction directly to the refracted outgoing direction, thereby learning object-specific refraction effects. NEMTO does not assume a homogeneous refractive index or fixed number of bounces. It represents the object surface with the zero level set of a signed distance function. This allows it to handle more complex geometry and refractive media than prior transparent object modeling techniques. By working with unknown refractive indices and natural illumination, NEMTO makes it practical to model real-world transparent objects for high-quality image-based synthesis.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes NEMTO, an end-to-end neural rendering pipeline to model transparent 3D objects with complex geometry and unknown refractive indices. The method takes 2D multi-view images of a transparent object under natural illumination as input, and is capable of high-quality novel view synthesis and relighting. The core of NEMTO is a Ray Bending Network (RBN) which learns to predict the refraction direction for each camera ray passing through the object, disentangling the effects of the complex geometry and refractive materials. The geometry is represented with a neural implicit surface modeled as the zero level set of a signed distance function. RBN takes the viewing direction, surface normal and intersection from the geometry network as input, and outputs the refracted direction to trace rays for rendering. This allows the method to handle complex light paths through the object better than analytical refraction models which are very sensitive to geometric errors. Experiments show NEMTO can synthesize more accurate views and relighting than prior neural rendering techniques for both synthetic and real transparent objects.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new method called NEMTO for modeling and rendering transparent 3D objects from images. The key problems and questions it aims to address are:

- Modeling transparent objects with complex geometries is challenging due to complex light paths bending through refraction and the strong coupling between object geometry and appearance. Existing methods make simplifying assumptions about known refractive indices or restricted light paths. 

- Can we develop an end-to-end neural rendering pipeline that can model arbitrary complex transparent geometries and unknown refractive indices?

- Can we disentangle and optimize the geometry and refractive appearance modeling parts to improve robustness and avoid entangled solutions? 

- How can we handle the ill-posed inverse problem of deriving geometry and refractive appearance from only 2D images?

To address these, the paper proposes NEMTO which combines implicit neural geometry modeling with a novel differentiable ray bending network to model refractions. It does not make assumptions on known refractive indices or restrict light bounces. The ray bending network helps disentangle geometry and appearance compared to analytical refractive rendering. The method is demonstrated on complex synthetic and real transparent objects to show high quality novel view synthesis and relighting results.

In summary, the key contributions are an end-to-end neural approach for modeling complex transparent geometries from images without known refractive information. The ray bending network is the key innovation that makes the usually coupled geometry-appearance problem more well-posed.
