# [Variational Auto-Encoder Based Deep Learning Technique For Filling Gaps   in Reacting PIV Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06461)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning technique called Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to accurately fill large gaps commonly found in particle image velocimetry (PIV) data from reacting flows. The CVAE model is trained on time-resolved vector fields from a swirl combustor containing artificial gaps covering 50-75% of the vectors. Partial convolutional networks allow the model to focus only on valid vectors during training. Unique conditioning variables tag each temporal snapshot to capture distinct flow features. During prediction, the decoder network combines sampled latent variables and conditioning variables to generate full vector fields. Remarkably, the CVAE technique demonstrates superior reconstruction capability, even for snapshots with 75% vector elimination. All key flow structures are recovered and velocity errors are on par with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CVAE provides inherent data compression. This generative deep learning approach offers a versatile solution to process large-scale, gappy experimental data for both model validation and training supervised learning models.
