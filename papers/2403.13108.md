# [Analyzing the Impact of Partial Sharing on the Resilience of Online   Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13108)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper addresses the issue of resilience against model poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL). FL allows devices like smartphones to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. However, some devices called Byzantine clients may be malicious and send corrupted model updates to degrade the global model performance. Existing communication-efficient FL algorithms lack analysis on resilience against such attacks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper analyzes the convergence and resilience of the Partial Sharing Online Federated Learning (PSO-Fed) algorithm against model poisoning attacks. PSO-Fed reduces communication overhead by having clients share only a subset of their model updates. 

The paper shows theoretically that PSO-Fed converges in mean and mean-square sense even under attacks. It derives the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) of PSO-Fed under attacks. A key finding is the existence of a non-trivial optimal step-size for PSO-Fed that minimizes this MSE. In contrast, for normal gradient descent, lower step-size always improves performance.

The paper also shows via analysis and experiments that partial sharing enhances resilience to attacks by limiting their impact, although it can worsen performance without attacks. There is thus an inherent tradeoff between communication efficiency and robustness against attacks.

Main Contributions:

- Theoretical convergence analysis of PSO-Fed under Byzantine model poisoning attacks
- Derivation of steady-state MSE of PSO-Fed incorporating impact of attacks  
- Identification and calculation of optimal step-size for PSO-Fed under attacks
- Demonstration via theory and simulations that partial sharing improves resilience to model poisoning attacks
- Analysis of tradeoff between communication efficiency and robustness against attacks with changing degree of partial sharing

The results provide useful insights into optimization of communication-efficient and attack-resilient federated learning algorithms.
