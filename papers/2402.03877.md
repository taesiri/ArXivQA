# [Beyond Lines and Circles: Unveiling the Geometric Reasoning Gap in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in constructive geometric problem solving, which requires planning, reasoning, and use of tools. Despite successes in other reasoning domains, LLMs struggle with this task. Specific issues identified include:

- Bias towards mimicking prompt examples rather than proper reasoning/abstraction
- Mathematical LLMs do not necessarily have better geometric reasoning
- Variable naming conventions significantly impact solutions
- Difficulties interpreting 2D spatial relationships and geometrically implausible actions

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework to enhance LLMs' geometric reasoning abilities. Main components:

1. Adaptive few-shot prompting - Updates prompt examples based on model's past experiences to build more nuanced context. 

2. Simulacra agents - Creates specialized solver/validator agents for natural language and geometric tool domains. Collaboration allows leveraging strengths of each while minimizing error propagation.

3. Visual relations prompt (VRP) - Auxiliary vision-language model describes spatial relationships/orientations between objects. Shared across agents to aid scene comprehension.  

4. Variable renaming - Replaces target variables like 'E' with more neutral 'X' to reduce naming convention biases.

Main Contributions:

- First extensive analysis showing state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with fundamental constructive geometry despite successes elsewhere

- Introduces adaptive prompting, multi-agent simulacra framework, VRP, and variable renaming to assist LLMs in overcoming limitations

- Achieves substantial improvements in geometric reasoning over non-collaborative methods through agents enhancing each others' specializations

- Framework is model-agnostic and cost-efficient. Significantly boosts smaller models to exceed few-shot performance of larger models


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-agent framework with specialized roles and interactions to enhance the geometric reasoning capabilities of large language models, which currently face challenges in constructive geometry problem-solving involving planning, spatial relationships, and tool usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The first extensive analysis revealing surprising difficulties state-of-the-art leading LLMs face in solving fundamental constructive geometric problems, highlighting a critical gap in their reasoning capabilities.

2. The introduction of three methods that assist LLMs in overcoming current limitations in the domain of constructive geometry:

(a) A dynamic prompting mechanism that enables LLMs to build upon previous interactions instead of static prompts

(b) A variable renaming technique that neutralizes biases from variable name conventions that complicate reasoning 

(c) A scene description prompt that enhances LLMs' abilities to understand and manipulate spatial relationships in a geometric context

3. A novel simulacra-based system that effectively combines tool usage, instruction following, and geometric problem solving. The system shows substantial improvement over non-collaborative methods, leading to effective solutions in geometric reasoning.

In summary, the key contribution is revealing deficiencies in LLMs for geometric reasoning and proposing methods to bridge this gap, including a multi-agent framework to enhance performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces an adaptive few-shot prompting mechanism. How does this compare to traditional few-shot prompting, and why is it more suitable for constructive geometry problems? What are the limitations of this approach?

2. The concept of simulacra is utilized for the conversational agents in the paper. Explain the differences between simulacra and traditional conversational agents. What advantages does using simulacra provide in solving geometric reasoning tasks?

3. The paper employs specialized agents in different domains, such as natural language and geometric tools. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of having domain-specific agents compared to more generalist agents. When would a specialized agent setup be preferred?  

4. Explain the visual relations prompt (VRP) introduced in the paper. How does it assist the agents in spatial reasoning and scene comprehension? What are the tradeoffs of using an auxiliary vision-language model like this?

5. The paper argues that variable naming conventions introduce biases that affect reasoning in LLMs. Elaborate on how the renaming technique addresses this issue. Does simply substituting variables fully mitigate this bias? Why or why not?

6. Compare and contrast the collaborative dialogue approach proposed versus more traditional approaches that rely on a single LLM. What unique benefits and limitations exist in formulating a multi-agent system?

7. One baseline introduced is attempting to randomly generate tool sequences and select variables to apply them to. Explain why this is an important baseline, and what it indicates regarding the complexity of constructive geometry.  

8. The method is shown to work on mathematical datasets besides Euclidea. Discuss the extent to which these results demonstrate true generalization versus simply tuning performance on specific tasks. What additional analyses could be done?

9. The limitations discuss preferring simpler single-agent approaches in some cases based on cost and speed. Propose some guidelines for determining when a complex, collaborative framework would be preferred over a simpler prompting approach.

10. The method aims to enhance reasoning capabilities in existing LLMs without modifying their weights. Compare this to alternative approaches that involve explicit training. What are the tradeoffs to consider between these two directions for improving abilities?
