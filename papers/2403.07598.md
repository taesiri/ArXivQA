# [Mondrian: On-Device High-Performance Video Analytics with Compressive   Packed Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Processing high-resolution video streams (e.g. 1080p) for object detection at high frame rates (>30 FPS) is challenging on resource-constrained edge devices due to limited throughput.
- Lightweight models still have low throughput (<2 FPS) on 1080p video. System optimization techniques like ROI extraction and tracking have limitations in accuracy and efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Mondrian, a high-performance object detection system for edge devices. 
- It uses a novel "Compressive Packed Inference" approach to minimize per-pixel processing cost by:
   1) Dynamically extracting and rescaling ROIs to "safe areas", the smallest regions that maintain accuracy. This is done efficiently using a hybrid ML-based prediction and reactive probing.
   2) Intelligently packing the scaled ROIs into large canvases to maximize accelerator utilization.

Main Contributions:
- Accuracy-aware ROI rescaling using a hybrid proactive predictor + reactive tuner to estimate optimal safe areas for ROIs.
- ROI packing scheduler that determines canvas sizes and packs ROIs into canvases to maximize throughput under latency constraints.
- End-to-end system Mondrian that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on throughput and accuracy. For example, it achieves 6.65x higher throughput than frame-wise inference on 1080p streams.
- Evaluated on multiple datasets, models and devices like Galaxy S22 to demonstrate generalizability.

In summary, the paper presents a novel compressive packed inference approach and an end-to-end system called Mondrian that enables high-performance object detection on high-resolution videos on resource-constrained edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Mondrian, an edge system that enables high-performance object detection on high-resolution video streams through a novel Compressive Packed Inference approach which minimizes per-pixel processing costs by selectively determining necessary pixels to process and combining them into packed canvases to maximize accelerator parallelism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing Mondrian, a high-performance edge-enabled object detection system that adopts a new "Compressive Packed Inference" approach to dynamically scale ROIs and pack them into large canvases to maximize accelerator parallelism.

2. Systematically exploring the effect of ROI scaling on inference accuracy and proposing an accurate and efficient ROI scale estimator. This is the first proposal to dynamically rescale ROIs based on the processor and their contents in object detection. 

3. Developing an ROI packing scheduler that intelligently combines ROIs into large packed canvases to maximize throughput of accelerators while satisfying latency requirements.

In summary, the key contribution is the new Compressive Packed Inference approach and associated techniques for dynamic ROI rescaling and packing to enable high-performance object detection on high-resolution videos using edge devices. The techniques are processor- and model-agnostic and demonstrate significant improvements in throughput and accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

- Compressive Packed Inference - The novel approach proposed in the paper to minimize per-pixel processing costs by selectively determining necessary pixels to process and combining them to maximize processing parallelism.

- ROI (Region of Interest) - The paper extracts and processes ROIs from input video frames rather than full frames to improve efficiency.

- Safe Area - The minimum ROI size that can be processed without compromising detection accuracy. Estimating this dynamically is a key challenge. 

- ROI Scale Estimator - A component proposed that estimates the safe area for ROIs using a hybrid machine learning and reactive probing approach.

- Packed Canvas Generator - A component that groups and packs the scaled ROIs into high-resolution packed canvases to maximize processing parallelism.

In summary, the key focus is on selectively processing pixels, dynamic ROI scaling, packing ROIs efficiently, and maximizing accelerator utilization to achieve high throughput and accuracy for object detection on high-resolution video streams.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel "Compressive Packed Inference" approach. Can you explain in more detail how this approach works and what are the key ideas behind it? 

2. The paper mentions the challenges of high variation in "safe areas" and efficient ROI packing. Can you elaborate on why estimating optimal safe areas is difficult and why ROI packing is an NP-hard problem?

3. The Hybrid ROI Scale Estimator contains two components - a Proactive Scale Predictor and a Reactive Scale Tuner. What is the motivation behind this hybrid approach? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using only proactive prediction or only reactive probing?

4. The paper extracts several visual features to predict the safe areas such as object size, pose, movement, and ROI reliability. Why are these useful indicators of the detection difficulty? Are there any other potential features you can think of? 

5. When designing the Packed Canvas Generator, the paper formulates an optimization problem with 0-1 knapsack, priority ordering, and 2D bin packing. Can you explain the rationale behind modeling it this way? What is the intuition?

6. The proposed system seems to rely heavily on the ROI extractor for good performance. What techniques are used in the ROI extractor and why are they important? What can go wrong in this component?

7. One of the baselines is "Emulated Batching" which divides the input into grids for batch processing. Why does the paper's approach of packing variable-sized ROIs into canvases work better than emulated batching?

8. How does the system handle dropped ROIs that cannot fit into the packed canvases? Why is consecutive drop minimization important here?

9. What are some ways the Packed Canvas Generator scheduling policy and algorithms can be improved or customized for different applications?

10. The paper focuses on utilizing the GPU parallelism better. How can the ideas be extended to other accelerators like NPUs and TPUs? What architecture-specific optimizations are possible?
