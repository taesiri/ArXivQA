# [Mondrian: On-Device High-Performance Video Analytics with Compressive   Packed Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Processing high-resolution video streams (e.g. 1080p) for object detection at high frame rates (>30 FPS) is challenging on resource-constrained edge devices due to limited throughput.
- Lightweight models still have low throughput (<2 FPS) on 1080p video. System optimization techniques like ROI extraction and tracking have limitations in accuracy and efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Mondrian, a high-performance object detection system for edge devices. 
- It uses a novel "Compressive Packed Inference" approach to minimize per-pixel processing cost by:
   1) Dynamically extracting and rescaling ROIs to "safe areas", the smallest regions that maintain accuracy. This is done efficiently using a hybrid ML-based prediction and reactive probing.
   2) Intelligently packing the scaled ROIs into large canvases to maximize accelerator utilization.

Main Contributions:
- Accuracy-aware ROI rescaling using a hybrid proactive predictor + reactive tuner to estimate optimal safe areas for ROIs.
- ROI packing scheduler that determines canvas sizes and packs ROIs into canvases to maximize throughput under latency constraints.
- End-to-end system Mondrian that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on throughput and accuracy. For example, it achieves 6.65x higher throughput than frame-wise inference on 1080p streams.
- Evaluated on multiple datasets, models and devices like Galaxy S22 to demonstrate generalizability.

In summary, the paper presents a novel compressive packed inference approach and an end-to-end system called Mondrian that enables high-performance object detection on high-resolution videos on resource-constrained edge devices.
