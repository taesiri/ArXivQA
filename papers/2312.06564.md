# [Promoting Counterfactual Robustness through Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06564)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the robustness of counterfactual explanations, which explain how an input to a machine learning model can be altered to change the model's prediction. The authors note that counterfactual explainers can lack robustness if a minor change in the input causes a major change in the explanation. They show both theoretically and empirically that reporting multiple diverse counterfactuals instead of a single one can improve robustness. However, computing an exhaustive set of all counterfactuals is infeasible, so they propose an efficient approximation algorithm that incrementally builds a diverse set of counterfactuals. Through experiments on several datasets, they demonstrate that their method generates more robust counterfactual explanations than the state-of-the-art DiCE algorithm, while also outperforming DiCE on other metrics like diversity and runtime. The authors conclude that promoting diversity is an effective strategy for improving the robustness of counterfactual explanations.
