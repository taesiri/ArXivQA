# [RLGNet: Repeating-Local-Global History Network for Temporal Knowledge   Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict future facts based on historical data. Most existing methods fail to concurrently understand historical information from both global and local perspectives. They also do not focus on learning from frequently recurring events in the history. This leads to overlooking important historical facts that can impact future trends.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Repeating-Local-Global History Network (RLGNet) that has three components:

1) Local History Encoder: Captures local facts by modeling TKG as a sequence of knowledge graphs across adjacent timestamps. Uses GCN, GRU and attention to learn structural features and evolution of entities and relations over the recent history.

2) Global History Encoder: Captures global facts by examining relevant facts across all previous timestamps. Uses attention to select important historical candidates based on their frequency and recency. 

3) Repeating History Encoder: Learns from frequently recurring historical events. Increases scores of candidates that have repeatedly occurred in the history.

The model combines scores from the three encoders to make final predictions. It also utilizes query information in all components to focus on pertinent facts.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel encoder design to concurrently understand repetitive, local and global historical facts based on the query.
2) Demonstrated the importance of global information in multi-step reasoning and local information in single-step reasoning. 
3) Extensive experiments proving the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 benchmark datasets for temporal knowledge graph reasoning.

In summary, the paper presents a new approach for temporal knowledge graph reasoning that learns repetitive, local and global historical patterns tailored to the query, advancing state-of-the-art in this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 RLGNet is a temporal knowledge graph reasoning model that captures repeating, local, and global historical information to effectively predict future facts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors designed three different levels of encoders (repeating, local, and global) to deal with repetitive, local, and global historical information respectively in temporal knowledge graphs.

2. The authors explored the contributions of repeating, global and local historical information to predictive performance in two different extrapolation settings - single-step reasoning and multi-step reasoning.

3. The authors conducted extensive experiments on six public temporal knowledge graph datasets, proving the effectiveness of their proposed model called RLGNet in entity prediction compared to existing models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel temporal knowledge graph reasoning model called RLGNet that captures repetitive, local and global historical information to achieve state-of-the-art performance on entity prediction across various benchmark datasets and reasoning settings.

The paper proposes a model called Repeating-Local-Global History Network (RLGNet) for temporal knowledge graph reasoning and entity prediction. The key ideas are using separate encoders to capture repeating, local, and global historical information in the knowledge graph, and integrating query information into these encoders. The model is evaluated on temporal reasoning tasks like single-step and multi-step reasoning on several benchmark TKG datasets. Some of the key findings are that considering all three types of historical information improves performance, and that query information helps capture facts most relevant for prediction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions capturing historical information from global, local, and repeating perspectives. Can you expand more on why considering these three perspectives is important for temporal knowledge graph reasoning? What unique insights does each perspective provide?

2. The local history encoder utilizes a GCN and GRU to model structural features and temporal evolution. What are the motivations behind choosing these specific network architectures? How do they help model local historical patterns? 

3. The global history encoder considers both time since last occurrence and frequency of occurrences for candidate entities. Why are both time and frequency important to consider from a global perspective? How do they differ in the insights they provide?

4. What motivated the design choice of using a time vector to represent both time and frequency in the global history encoder? What are the potential benefits and downsides of this design decision? 

5. The repeating history encoder focuses specifically on frequently occurring historical events. Why can learning from repetitive events be particularly useful for forecasting future facts? What mechanisms allow the model to identify and leverage these repetitive patterns?

6. The model trains the three encoders separately. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of training them independently? Do you think a joint training approach could be beneficial? Why or why not?

7. The alpha hyperparameter balances the local and global historical information. The optimal value differs substantially between single-step and multi-step reasoning. What causes this difference? How can the model better balance local vs global based on the reasoning task?

8. For the GDELT dataset, the performance is much more reliant on global rather than local history. What unique properties of GDELT could explain this? How could the model be adapted to better leverage local patterns in GDELT?

9. The number of GCN layers, omega, has little impact on ICEWS14 but significantly impacts YAGO. What differences in the datasets could lead to this difference in sensitivity? Should omega be optimized individually for each dataset?

10. The top k parameter for determining repetitive facts has a significant impact on YAGO but not on ICEWS14. Again, what explanations could there be for this difference? How should top k be determined for a new dataset?
