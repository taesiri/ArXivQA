The key aspects of this research question seem to be:- The aim is to create a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' mastery of diverse domain knowledge across many disciplines. - The benchmark intends to be more comprehensive and multi-dimensional compared to existing benchmarks, in order to better assess the knowledge capabilities of advanced LLMs with emergent skills.- There is a focus on evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs through granular analysis of their performance across fine-grained knowledge domains. - The benchmark aims to provide insights into how well current LLMs acquire and apply knowledge, as well as identify areas for improvement.- The overall goal is to develop an "ever-updating benchmark" that can keep pace with the rapid advancement of LLMs and continue providing effective evaluation.So in summary, the central research objective is creating a comprehensive, granular and adaptable benchmark tailored specifically for evaluating the holistic domain knowledge capabilities of advanced LLMs. The benchmark aims to provide richer insights compared to existing options.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be introducing a new benchmark called Xiezhi for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of Xiezhi highlighted in the paper are:- It covers 516 disciplines across 13 subject categories, making it the most comprehensive domain knowledge benchmark to date. The taxonomy of disciplines is derived from the Chinese Disciplinary Taxonomy.- It contains 249,587 multiple choice questions sourced from diverse exams and academic surveys. This makes it a very large and diverse dataset for evaluation.- It has an auto-updating framework that can continually expand the benchmark with new questions over time. This helps keep the benchmark fresher than the training data used by LLMs.- It consists of 3 versions - Xiezhi-Meta, Xiezhi-Specialty, and Xiezhi-Interdiscipline - to enable testing both specialty knowledge in individual domains and interdisciplinary knowledge.- The authors propose new evaluation protocols like using 50 options per question instead of 4 to better discern model capabilities. - Experiments are conducted on 47 LLMs using Xiezhi and 3 other benchmarks. The results demonstrate Xiezhi's ability to effectively differentiate between models and identify strengths/weaknesses.In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of Xiezhi as a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, and auto-updating benchmark for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of LLMs. The large scale, diversity, and novelty of the benchmark are emphasized.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field:- This paper introduces a new comprehensive benchmark called Xiezhi for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Other recent works have also proposed new benchmarks, but Xiezhi is unique in its breadth and depth of coverage across 516 disciplines. - The paper highlights the need for benchmarks that can effectively discern capabilities of both large and small LLMs. Many existing benchmarks only show performance differences on the most advanced LLMs. Xiezhi seems able to differentiate abilities across models of varying sizes.- The authors propose some novel evaluation methods, like using 50 options per question to reduce random guessing and ranking options by probability rather than extracting a chosen answer. These help address limitations in current LLM evaluation techniques.- Xiezhi incorporates auto-updating and balanced specialty/interdisciplinary subsets to stay ahead of LLM training data and align with trends in consolidating LLM capabilities. Other benchmarks have not emphasized these aspects as explicitly.- The large scale experimental evaluation on 47 LLMs is quite comprehensive compared to most prior works. The analysis of model performance differences across domains and benchmark types is a significant contribution.- Overall, Xiezhi pushes forward the state-of-the-art in domain knowledge benchmarking through its expansive scope, novel evaluation designs, and extensive empirical analysis. The paper sets a new standard for rigorous LLM assessment.In summary, this paper makes several notable contributions that advance beyond previous research in developing better benchmarks to evaluate the domain mastery abilities of LLMs. The Xiezhi benchmark represents an important step forward for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more comprehensive and prospective benchmarks to keep pace with the rapid development of LLMs. The authors suggest creating benchmarks that cover more tasks, reveal distinctions between models more precisely, and use fresher data than the models' training sets.- Improving evaluation methods for generative LLMs beyond using multiple choice questions and extraction. The authors propose evaluating based on generative probabilities to avoid relying on a model's ability to directly answer multiple choice questions.- Developing additional benchmarks focused on assessing LLMs' capabilities to understand instructions and align with human values. The authors argue these are important dimensions of LLMs that require dedicated benchmarks.- Continuing to expand the coverage of domains, disciplines, cultures, languages, and data sources included in benchmarks like Xiezhi. The authors suggest this will lead to more thorough and fair evaluations.- Releasing more training data and benchmarks publicly to facilitate research. The authors call upon academic and industrial sectors to contribute to the development of benchmarks.- Incorporating more automated updating into benchmarks to ensure they stay ahead of LLM training data.In summary, the main directions are developing more comprehensive and prospective benchmarks, improving evaluation methods, expanding domain coverage, releasing more data publicly, and automating updating of benchmarks. The key goal is to promote more effective evaluation to drive progress in LLM research.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new benchmark called Xiezhi for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Xiezhi consists of 249,587 multiple choice questions spanning 516 disciplines across 13 categories derived from the Chinese Disciplinary Taxonomy. The benchmark is constructed in two stages - first a manually annotated set of 20k questions from graduate entrance exams forms the Xiezhi-Meta dataset, which is used to train an annotation model for automated labeling. This model is then used to annotate 170k exam questions and 80k auto-generated questions from academic surveys to expand the benchmark. Additionally, Xiezhi-Specialty and Xiezhi-Interdiscipline datasets are provided to assess knowledge from a single domain versus across multiple domains. The paper evaluates 47 recent LLMs on Xiezhi and proposes generating probability rankings of options rather than extracting choices from the LLMs directly. Results show top performance requires large pretraining and fine-tuning, and that Xiezhi is effective at discerning capability differences between LLMs.
