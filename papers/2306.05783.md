## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be introducing a new benchmark called Xiezhi for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of Xiezhi highlighted in the paper are:

- It covers 516 disciplines across 13 subject categories, making it the most comprehensive domain knowledge benchmark to date. The taxonomy of disciplines is derived from the Chinese Disciplinary Taxonomy.

- It contains 249,587 multiple choice questions sourced from diverse exams and academic surveys. This makes it a very large and diverse dataset for evaluation.

- It has an auto-updating framework that can continually expand the benchmark with new questions over time. This helps keep the benchmark fresher than the training data used by LLMs.

- It consists of 3 versions - Xiezhi-Meta, Xiezhi-Specialty, and Xiezhi-Interdiscipline - to enable testing both specialty knowledge in individual domains and interdisciplinary knowledge.

- The authors propose new evaluation protocols like using 50 options per question instead of 4 to better discern model capabilities. 

- Experiments are conducted on 47 LLMs using Xiezhi and 3 other benchmarks. The results demonstrate Xiezhi's ability to effectively differentiate between models and identify strengths/weaknesses.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of Xiezhi as a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, and auto-updating benchmark for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of LLMs. The large scale, diversity, and novelty of the benchmark are emphasized.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more comprehensive and prospective benchmarks to keep pace with the rapid development of LLMs. The authors suggest creating benchmarks that cover more tasks, reveal distinctions between models more precisely, and use fresher data than the models' training sets.

- Improving evaluation methods for generative LLMs beyond using multiple choice questions and extraction. The authors propose evaluating based on generative probabilities to avoid relying on a model's ability to directly answer multiple choice questions.

- Developing additional benchmarks focused on assessing LLMs' capabilities to understand instructions and align with human values. The authors argue these are important dimensions of LLMs that require dedicated benchmarks.

- Continuing to expand the coverage of domains, disciplines, cultures, languages, and data sources included in benchmarks like Xiezhi. The authors suggest this will lead to more thorough and fair evaluations.

- Releasing more training data and benchmarks publicly to facilitate research. The authors call upon academic and industrial sectors to contribute to the development of benchmarks.

- Incorporating more automated updating into benchmarks to ensure they stay ahead of LLM training data.

In summary, the main directions are developing more comprehensive and prospective benchmarks, improving evaluation methods, expanding domain coverage, releasing more data publicly, and automating updating of benchmarks. The key goal is to promote more effective evaluation to drive progress in LLM research.

The paper demonstrates that Xiezhi effectively discerns capability differences between LLMs and serves as an impactful benchmark to drive continued progress. Key benefits of Xiezhi highlight its extensive domain coverage, large scale, and automatic updating mechanism to stay ahead of LLM training data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called Xiezhi for evaluating the domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Xiezhi consists of 249,587 multiple choice questions spanning 516 disciplines across 13 categories derived from the Chinese Disciplinary Taxonomy. The benchmark is constructed in two stages - first a manually annotated set of 20k questions from graduate entrance exams forms the Xiezhi-Meta dataset, which is used to train an annotation model for automated labeling. This model is then used to annotate 170k exam questions and 80k auto-generated questions from academic surveys to expand the benchmark. Additionally, Xiezhi-Specialty and Xiezhi-Interdiscipline datasets are provided to assess knowledge from a single domain versus across multiple domains. The paper evaluates 47 recent LLMs on Xiezhi and proposes generating probability rankings of options rather than extracting choices from the LLMs directly. Results show top performance requires large pretraining and fine-tuning, and that Xiezhi is effective at discerning capability differences between LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper seems to be addressing the need for new natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks to properly evaluate the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs). 

The key problems/questions it is trying to tackle are:

- Existing benchmarks are becoming outdated and unable to properly discern the capabilities of the latest LLMs, which have grown rapidly in size and complexity.

- New benchmarks are needed that cover a wider range of tasks across numerous diverse domains, provide large volumes of data, and use fresher data than what may already be included in LLM training sets. 

- There is a need for benchmarks that can effectively evaluate both the biggest LLMs like GPT-3 as well as smaller LLMs. Many existing benchmarks only show performance differences on the largest models.

- New evaluation methods are needed rather than just using multiple choice questions and extracting answers, which many LLMs struggle with. The authors propose using generative probability for ranking instead.

- There is a lack of comprehensive domain-specific benchmarks that assess real-world knowledge across many disciplines. The authors aim to provide this through their proposed Xiezhi benchmark.

In summary, the key focus is on developing more comprehensive and challenging NLP benchmarks using fresh data that can push the capabilities of modern LLMs and provide more nuanced evaluations between different models. The paper aims to address the limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating the latest advances in language models.
