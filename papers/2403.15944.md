# [Adaptive Super Resolution For One-Shot Talking-Head Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15944)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- One-shot talking head generation methods aim to synthesize a photo-realistic talking head video using only a single portrait image as input. However, existing methods often produce low quality results with blurry details due to relying solely on pixel transformations. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a novel approach to integrate adaptive super-resolution into the talking head generation pipeline to enhance the visual quality without requiring additional modules or post-processing. 

- The key idea is to intentionally downsample the input portrait image during training while keeping high-quality ground truth for supervision. This forces the network to learn to extract high-frequency details from low-quality inputs.  

- During inference, when a high-quality portrait is provided, the pre-trained encoder can better capture and reconstruct high-frequency facial details in the generated talking head video.

Main Contributions:
- First work to incorporate super-resolution techniques into talking head generation in an end-to-end trainable way unlike prior works.

- Proposed adaptive encoder-decoder structure that can extract high-frequency details from low-quality inputs and improve visual quality.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and metrics through extensive experiments. Outperforms existing methods in preserving identity and generating accurate motions.

- Qualitative results show significant improvements in visual quality especially in regions like teeth and eyes. User study also confirms enhanced realism.

In summary, the paper presents a simple yet effective super-resolution approach for one-shot talking head generation to reconstruct high-quality videeos without any external post-processing. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate clear improvements over previous state-of-the-art.
