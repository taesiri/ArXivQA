# [Graph Data Condensation via Self-expressive Graph Structure   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing graph data condensation methods have limitations in effectively preserving useful information from the original graph structure and capturing inter-node correlations within the condensed dataset. 
- Methods like GCond and SFGC do not leverage the original graph structure. SGDD uses the original structure but has unstable performance.
- No previous method constructs an explicit and interpretable graph structure for the condensed data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called Graph Data Condensation via Self-expressive Graph Structure Reconstruction (GCSR).
- It has 3 key modules:
   1) Initialization: Initializes node features using message passing on original graph. Initializes a regularizer using original graph structure.
   2) Self-Expressive Reconstruction: Reconstructs explicit graph structure for condensed data by exploiting self-expressiveness property of graph data. Uses a closed-form solution for efficiency.
   3) Update: Updates node features by matching gradients with original data. Updates regularizer in a bootstrapping manner.

Main Contributions:
- First method to construct explicit and interpretable graph structure for condensed data based on self-expressiveness of graph data.
- Proposes a novel 3-module framework GCSR for graph condensation via self-expressive graph reconstruction.
- Achieves superior performance over baselines on 5 datasets. Condensed data mimics inter-class similarity of original graph.
- Initialization via message passing brings better starting point and stability.
- Framework is model-agnostic and achieves excellent transferability.
