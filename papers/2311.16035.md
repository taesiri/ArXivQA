# [RobustState: Boosting Fidelity of Quantum State Preparation via   Noise-Aware Variational Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16035)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces RobustState, a novel training methodology for variational quantum state preparation that achieves both high robustness to noise and high training efficiency. The key innovation is performing backpropagation on a classical simulator using the noisy outputs from real quantum devices. This allows incorporating actual hardware noise information into the gradient calculations during training. RobustState is shown to significantly enhance state fidelity, coherence times, and reduce errors compared to alternative approaches across extensive experiments on 10 real IBM quantum computers. It serves as a versatile plugin that can improve gate or pulse-level ansatzes from existing frameworks. The noise-aware training concept is also extended to other variational algorithms like unitary synthesis. On average, RobustState improved state fidelity by 50% for 4-qubit and 72% for 5-qubit states over baselines. The coherent errors were reduced by up to 7.1x which highlights mitigating coherent errors as a source of RobustState's advantages. The plug-and-play nature, broad applicability across ansatzes, and consistent fidelity improvements demonstrate RobustState's effectiveness as a valuable subroutine for near-term quantum computing applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes RobustState, a noise-aware training framework for variational quantum state preparation that combines real hardware outputs with classical simulator intermediates to perform robust backpropagation, achieving high noise resilience and training efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a noise-aware training framework called RobustState for robust quantum state preparation. Specifically:

1) It introduces a noise-aware back-propagation approach that utilizes measurement outcomes from real quantum machines and intermediate results from classical simulators to calculate gradients that incorporate real noise information. This achieves both high noise robustness and training efficiency.

2) It is extensively applicable across various ansatz designs at both gate and pulse levels. It can also be applied to other variational algorithms like unitary synthesis and quantum state regression. 

3) Comprehensive experiments on 10 real quantum machines demonstrate the framework reduces coherent errors by up to 7.1x and improves state preparation fidelity by 50% on average for 4-qubit states and 72% on average for 5-qubit states compared to baseline approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating a versatile noise-aware training methodology to boost the fidelity of quantum state preparation on real noisy devices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Variational quantum state preparation (VQSP): Using a parameterized quantum circuit to iteratively refine and prepare a target quantum state. A core technique explored in this paper.

- Noise-aware training: Optimizing the parameters of a variational circuit using real hardware noise information to make the prepared states more robust. The key idea proposed in RobustState. 

- Gradient backpropagation: Computing gradients of the loss function with respect to all circuit parameters efficiently in one backward pass through a simulator. Enabled by RobustState for noise-aware VQSP.

- Quantum state fidelity: Measures the closeness between two quantum states. Used as a metric to evaluate prepared state quality.

- Hardware-efficient ansatzes: Quantum circuit architectures using primarily native gates to reduce errors and overheads. Utilized in the experiments.  

- Coherent errors: Errors that cause the state vector to deviate from the ideal, which can be reduced through software optimization techniques like RobustState.

So in summary, the key focus is using noise-aware backpropagation training to boost the fidelity of variational quantum state preparation in the presence of hardware noise, especially coherent errors. The proposed RobustState technique is evaluated on metrics like state fidelity using hardware-efficient ansatzes.
