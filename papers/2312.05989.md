# [A Note on the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05989)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper studies diffusion models, which are deep generative models for learning complex data distributions. Diffusion models come in two main flavors: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models (SGMs). Both transform samples from the data distribution into noise through a forward process, then learn a backward process to reverse this and generate new samples. Theoretical analysis of these models' convergence is still limited, with existing bounds relying on strong assumptions or suffering from exponential dependencies. 

Proposed Solution
This paper provides a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the model distribution learned by a DDPM. Unlike prior work, the bound avoids assumptions on the data distribution, learned score function, and exponential dependencies. The key ideas are:

1) View the DDPM as a hierarchical VAE with fixed encoders, and adapt proof techniques from VAE theory. 

2) Upper-bound the Wasserstein distance using the triangle inequality and bounds on two terms: distance between data distribution and empirical regenerated distribution, and distance between empirical regenerated distribution and model distribution.

3) Bound the first term using a reconstruction loss function and PAC-Bayes analysis. Bound the second term using the Lipschitz continuity of the backward process.


Main Contributions
- Derives a Wasserstein distance bound for DDPMs with no assumptions on data distribution or learned score function.

- Avoids exponential dependencies in the bound.

- Provides an explicit quantitative bound based on a reconstruction loss computed on a finite sample.

- Uses elementary proofs adapted from VAE theory, instead of relying on intricate stochastic differential equation analysis.

- Discusses reasonable ranges for the Lipschitz constants arising in the bound when using a common DDPM forward process.

- Specializes the main bound for this common forward process to provide a fully explicit convergence guarantee.

The approach opens an avenue to establish theoretical guarantees for diffusion models while avoiding common pitfalls, using simple and intuitive proof techniques.
