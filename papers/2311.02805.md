## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes MaRio (Multi-rewArd RatiOnalization), a method to improve the quality of rationales generated by small language models for question answering. The key idea is to leverage multiple "reward" metrics that measure different aspects of rationale quality, such as plausibility, diversity, and consistency, and optimize the model to maximize these rewards. MaRio first distills a small LM (e.g. T5-Large) on high-quality rationales from GPT-3, then uses a multi-reward reinforcement learning algorithm called QuaRK to optimize rationale generation based on rewards. Experiments on five QA datasets show MaRio rationales lead to better task accuracy while also improving quality metrics over baselines. The authors use human evaluations to confirm MaRio rationales are preferred and are more plausible/consistent. A key benefit is enabling small LMs to generate high-quality rationales competitive with much larger models. Limitations include dependence on initial GPT-3 data and the choice of reward metrics. Overall, MaRio provides an effective approach to tailor small LMs for high-quality self-rationalization.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MaRio, a method to improve the quality of rationales generated by small language models for question answering. Rationales are free-text explanations that justify an AI system's predictions. Prior work shows that high-quality rationales emerge at large model sizes, like GPT-3 with 175B parameters. This paper focuses on improving rationale quality from smaller models. 

MaRio first trains a small LM (e.g. T5-Large) on rationales generated by GPT-3, then uses a multi-reward conditioning method based on QuaRK to optimize the LM for higher rationale quality. Specifically, MaRio defines three key rationale properties - plausibility, diversity, and consistency - and uses automated metrics to score generated rationales on each one. The LM is trained to condition on control codes representing quality levels of each metric.

Experiments on 5 QA datasets show MaRio improves rationale quality and task accuracy over baselines. Human evaluations also preferred MaRio rationales as more plausible and consistent. While not reaching GPT-3 quality, MaRio significantly bridges the gap, enabling smaller 200x smaller LMs to generate higher quality rationales. Limitations include reliance on initial GPT-3 data and the need for more metrics capturing rationale properties. Overall, MaRio demonstrates promising advances in efficiently generating high-quality rationales from small LMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm called MaRio that improves the quality of rationales generated by small neural language models in terms of plausibility, diversity, and consistency, validated by both automatic metrics and human evaluation.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can small-sized language models be tailored to generate high-quality rationales that improve both downstream task performance and the semantic quality of the rationales themselves?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Small LMs can be effectively trained to generate rationales satisfying requirements like plausibility, consistency, and diversity while also improving task accuracy, using a multi-reward reinforcement learning approach.

2) Optimizing solely for downstream task accuracy does not naturally lead to improved rationale quality. Rationale quality needs to be directly optimized through rewards like plausibility, diversity, and consistency.

3) Rationale quality improvements can be achieved in small LMs by first distilling knowledge from a large LM's rationales, then fine-tuning with multi-reward reinforcement learning.

In summary, the central research focus is on improving rationale quality in small LMs through a combination of distillation and multi-reward reinforcement learning, rather than just optimizing for task accuracy alone. The key hypothesis is that this approach can make small LMs generate better rationales while also improving their task performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MaRio, a multi-reward optimization method for improving the quality of rationales generated by small language models. The key ideas are:

- Using rationales generated by large LMs like GPT-3 as initial supervision to train a small LM for self-rationalization. 

- Framing rationale generation as a multi-reward conditioned problem, where the LM is optimized to maximize rewards corresponding to rationale quality properties like plausibility, diversity, and consistency. 

- Introducing two variants of MaRio - Canonical and Additive that explore different ways to optimize for multiple rewards.

- Evaluating MaRio on 5 QA datasets and showing it improves rationale quality in terms of the targeted properties as well as downstream task accuracy, compared to baselines.

- Conducting human evaluations that show MaRio rationales are preferred and qualitatively better than supervised finetuned rationales.

So in summary, the main contribution is a new method to improve the quality of rationales from small LMs by optimizing for multiple rationale properties through reward conditioning. This is shown to work better than existing approaches like fine-tuning or filtering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of self-rationalizing language models:

- It focuses on improving the quality of rationales generated by smaller LMs, whereas most prior work uses very large LMs like GPT-3. This could make self-rationalization more accessible with smaller, more efficient models. 

- It optimizes rationale quality directly using multiple reward signals like plausibility, diversity, and consistency. Much prior work focuses only on downstream task performance. Optimizing rationale quality more directly is a newer approach.

- It uses a multi-reward reinforcement learning method to optimize rationale quality, whereas most prior work uses supervised learning on human rationales or few-shot prompting of large LMs. Using RL to optimize non-differentiable quality metrics is a relatively new technique. 

- It incorporates human evaluation to compare rationale quality, going beyond just automated metrics. Human assessment of rationale quality is important but less common in prior work.

- The paper focuses on commonsense reasoning and science QA datasets where logical reasoning is required. This is a useful testbed for rationale quality compared to simpler tasks like sentiment analysis.

Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in focusing on rationale quality, optimizing it more directly, showing results on smaller LMs, and rigorously evaluating with humans. The approach seems promising compared to prior work that overlooks rationale quality or uses massive LMs. More work is still needed to scale up the approach and extend it to other tasks and metrics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending their algorithm to improve rationales along more dimensions like completeness, factuality, and human utility. The authors note that the properties they focused on in this work (plausibility, diversity, consistency) are necessary but not sufficient for high-quality rationales. They suggest exploring additional properties and metrics.

- Collecting an extended set of rationale properties and corresponding metrics, then applying their multi-reward MaRio method to optimize for those properties concurrently. The authors acknowledge that determining a complete set of necessary rationale properties is still an open problem. 

- Investigating issues around multi-reward "hacking" more deeply, where models find shortcuts to game metrics without improving rationale quality. The authors encountered some challenges with weak or incompatible rewards leading to repetitive or illogical rationales.

- Evaluating the impact of rationale quality improvements on downstream model and human utility. The authors generated higher-quality rationales with their method, but did not deeply investigate if those rationales lead to better model or human outcomes.

- Experimenting with more diverse tasks beyond question answering. The authors focus on QA tasks in this work, but suggest expanding to other tasks like summarization, translation, etc. that also require explanations.

In summary, the main future directions are: extending the rationale properties optimized, collecting more metrics, mitigating reward hacking, demonstrating downstream utility, and generalizing across more tasks. The authors aim to build on this work to develop more efficient, high-quality, and human-centric rationalization techniques.
