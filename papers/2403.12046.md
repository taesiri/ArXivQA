# [GPT-4V(ision) Unsuitable for Clinical Care and Education: A   Clinician-Evaluated Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
OpenAI recently released GPT-4V, a large multimodal model capable of processing images and text. However, its ability to interpret medical images and provide accurate diagnoses is unknown. This paper evaluates GPT-4V's proficiency in analyzing diverse medical images and assessing if its outputs can be safely relied upon for clinical care and education.

Methods:  
The authors collected a dataset of 142 medical images across modalities like x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ECGs, endoscopy images etc. covering various diseases. Clinicians like surgeons, physicians, cardiologists and dermatologists evaluated GPT-4V's image interpretations and diagnoses. They rated multiple aspects like accuracy, safety of advice, and suitability for medical education.  

Results:
GPT-4V correctly interpreted only 15 out of 69 general images. Its ECG analyses were rated 2.25/5 in quality and were less competent than standard automated reads. Only 3/24 ECG analyses were considered helpful for medical students. Across modalities, around 30-40% of GPT-4V's analyses provided unsafe advice. Clinicians expressed low comfort in letting students rely on GPT-4V's content.

Conclusions:  
The study reveals that GPT-4V has major limitations in interpreting medical images and providing accurate diagnoses. Its advice can be unsafe at times. The authors advise against using GPT-4V for clinical decision making and suggest further evaluation is needed before deployment in healthcare settings. They highlight the need for transparency regarding training data and rigorous real-world testing of large language models before making overblown claims about revolutionizing healthcare.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates GPT-4V's ability to interpret medical images across various modalities and finds that while it can identify some features, its diagnostic accuracy is poor, posing risks to patient safety if used for clinical decision-making.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

An evaluation by clinicians (senior residents and board-certified physicians) assessing the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4V model in interpreting various medical images and providing diagnosis and management recommendations. The key findings were that while GPT-4V could identify some features in medical images, its diagnostic accuracy was poor across modalities like CT scans, MRIs, ECGs, and clinical photos. The model also frequently provided dangerous or incorrect advice. The authors conclude that GPT-4V in its current state is unsuitable for clinical care or medical education due to patient safety concerns. The paper serves as an important benchmark and warning about the limitations of large language models in high-stakes medical applications.

In summary, the main contribution is a clinician-evaluated assessment highlighting the deficiencies of GPT-4V for medical image interpretation and diagnosis despite its capabilities as a large multimodal model.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords that seem most relevant are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- GPT-4V
- Multimodal learning
- Medical imaging
- Interpretation 
- Diagnosis
- Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Patient safety
- Training data
- Bias
- Healthcare AI

The paper evaluates GPT-4V, OpenAI's large multimodal model, on its ability to interpret various medical images and provide accurate diagnosis and advice. It conducts an assessment involving physicians across specialties to determine GPT-4V's capabilities and limitations in areas like radiology, cardiology, and dermatology. Key concepts examined are the model's diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making abilities, safety for medical education, issues around training data such as bias and representation, and the need for further evaluation of healthcare AI. So keywords around these main topics seem most salient.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the rationale behind using both senior residents and board-certified physicians to evaluate GPT-4V's capabilities? Does having evaluators at different levels of expertise provide any additional insights?

2. The study utilized public-facing images that may have been part of GPT-4V's training dataset. How might this have impacted the model's performance? Would additional experiments with entirely new datasets be warranted? 

3. For the image prompts provided to GPT-4V, what considerations went into designing prompts that were medically relevant but also aligned with OpenAI's content policy? Could the prompts have been designed differently to better evaluate GPT-4V's capabilities?

4. The evaluation platform collected both quantitative measurements (e.g. Likert scale ratings) and qualitative feedback (free-text comments) from clinicians. What are the tradeoffs between these two types of responses in evaluating LLMs, and how might future studies best combine both quantitative and qualitative analyses?

5. What additional modalities could have been included in the image dataset (e.g. pathology slides, ophthalmology, etc.) to provide a more comprehensive assessment of GPT-4V across medical specialties? How feasible would it be to compile such a dataset?

6. For the prompts provided, GPT-4V was asked to take on the persona of a medical tutor. How might framing the prompts differently (e.g. as a consulting physician providing a second-opinion) have impacted how leading/directive the model's responses were?

7. What risks are introduced when using public-facing patient images without contextual clinical information? Could the lack of patient context have disadvantaged GPT-4V in this evaluation?

8. What potential harms could arise from inaccurate or low-quality outputs from large language models used in medical education? How can we safeguard against this?

9. The study notes that newer models are being designed specifically for clinical settings. What evaluation frameworks could be used to rigorously validate these models prior to any real-world piloting? 

10. If GPT-4V's responses had proven more accurate, what additional experiments would have been needed to establish whether the model has the reasoning and decision-making capabilities necessary for clinical deployment?
