# [SplattingAvatar: Realistic Real-Time Human Avatars with Mesh-Embedded   Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05087)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SplattingAvatar: Realistic Real-Time Human Avatars with Mesh-Embedded Gaussian Splatting":

Problem:
- Creating photorealistic and animatable human avatars that can render in real-time is challenging. Increasing model quality typically means increasing complexity which leads to higher computational demands. 
- Existing methods using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have limitations in capturing high-frequency details and realistic surface deformations due to reliance on MLP-based motion control and ambiguous mapping between canonical and posed space during volume rendering.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SplattingAvatar, a hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh with 3D Gaussians embedded on the mesh using trainable embeddings. 
- The mesh captures body motion and surface deformations efficiently. The Gaussians modeled using Gaussian Splatting capture high-frequency geometry and appearance details crucial for realism.
- The embeddings associate each Gaussian with a triangle on the mesh, defined by barycentric coordinates and displacement along the normal. This allows explicit control of Gaussian motion by the mesh.

Key Contributions:
- A novel framework that combines the efficiency of meshes and detail capability of spline-based Gaussian Splatting for avatar modeling.
- An embedding technique to associate Gaussians with the mesh, allowing explicit and non-ambiguous motion control.
- Lifted optimization during training to simultaneously optimize Gaussian parameters and embeddings.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art quality on head and full body avatars while achieving real-time rendering on mobile devices.

In summary, SplattingAvatar advances avatar modeling through an efficient hybrid representation that achieves both realism and performance by disentangling mesh-based motion control and spline-based appearance modeling. The explicit integration of these complementary techniques is enabled by a trainable embedding method.
