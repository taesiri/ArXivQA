# [Natural Language as Polices: Reasoning for Coordinate-Level Embodied   Control with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional approaches for robotics action planning from natural language tend to be task-specific, struggle to generalize to novel tasks/objects, and require extensive training. 
- Recent LLM-based approaches focus on generating code from instructions, but this lacks high-level contextual meaning to efficiently describe skills. Also limited by predefined APIs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based reasoning framework that generates natural language plans and low-level actions instead of code. 
- Convert visual inputs to text descriptions. Provide manually created natural language reasoning chains as examples. 
- LLM then predicts coordinate-level plans without relying on predefined APIs. Converts between front and top views.

Key Contributions:
- Reasoning with direct environment interaction using language
- Coordinate-level action prediction 
- Teaching robots via natural language
- Demonstrates potential to transfer skills from known to novel tasks

Evaluation:
- Tested on VIMABench multimodal benchmark
- CoT reasoning significantly improves success rate over no reasoning
- Shows promise for novel tasks by extracting skills from examples
- Handles numeric values well in many cases
- Limitations: limited object description, no feedback, restricted actions 

Conclusions:
- Quantitative results don't consistently outperform others, but shows potential
- Underscores capability for novel task generalization
- Future work on more tasks/situations and generalization
