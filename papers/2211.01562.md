# [PINTO: Faithful Language Reasoning Using Prompt-Generated Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01562)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we build an interpretable model that can generate free-text rationales to reveal its reasoning process before making a prediction, while ensuring the faithfulness of the rationales to the model's predictions?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) A pipeline approach with separate modules for rationalization and reasoning can improve both performance and faithfulness compared to prior methods. 

2) Prompt-based learning can be used for the rationalization module to avoid expensive human rationale annotation.

3) Counterfactual regularization during training can help ensure the reasoning module properly utilizes the generated rationales.

4) Faithful reasoning based on rationales can improve the model's generalization ability.

So in summary, the central focus seems to be developing techniques to produce free-text rationales that faithfully reflect the model's reasoning, with the goals of improving performance, interpretability and generalization. The key ideas are using prompt-based learning for rationale generation and counterfactual regularization to connect the rationales with the model's predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting PINTO, a method for generating free-text rationales to explain neural language model predictions, while ensuring the rationales are used faithfully. Specifically:

- PINTO uses a large frozen language model to generate rationales via prompt-based learning, avoiding the need for expensive rationale annotation. 

- A smaller reasoning module is trained to make predictions using the generated rationales as context. 

- Crucially, the reasoning module is regularized via counterfactual training to reduce its confidence when rationales are perturbed, enforcing faithful reliance on them.

- Experiments across 4 QA datasets show PINTO improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy compared to baselines. The rationales are also shown to be more faithful in explaining the reasoning module's predictions.

In summary, the key contribution is a new rationale-based reasoning paradigm that generates free-text rationales without annotations, and ensures they are used properly via counterfactual training. This improves performance while providing more reliable rationales to explain the model's reasoning process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PINTO, a pipeline for generating free-text rationales via prompt-based learning with a frozen medium-scale language model, and then reasoning over the rationales with a fine-tuned small-scale language model that is regularized via counterfactual training to ensure faithful use of the rationales.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper presents a novel pipeline approach for rationale-based reasoning, consisting of a prompted rationalizing module and a counterfactually regularized reasoning module. Other works have explored pipeline approaches, but they typically rely on expensive human rationale annotation and do not enforce rationale faithfulness like the counterfactual regularization in this paper.

- The paper demonstrates strong performance on commonsense reasoning benchmarks like CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA. This aligns with the overall goal in this field to develop AI systems capable of sound implicit reasoning, though performance metrics and datasets vary across papers. 

- A key focus of this work is improving the faithfulness of rationales to model predictions. Many other papers have proposed rationale generation methods, but faithfulness has been a major concern and methods to directly improve it are still limited. The counterfactual regularization technique here provides a way to address this.

- The prompted rationalizing module transfers knowledge from a large frozen LM into the pipeline with minimal annotation. Other approaches like self-rationalization or pipeline methods tend to require expensive rationale annotation. Prompting frozen LMs is gaining more traction as a knowledge-transfer technique.

- Analyses in this paper, like varying rationale quality or using perturbed rationales at test time, provide insights into how faithfulness impacts overall pipeline performance. Such focused analysis helps advance understanding of how rationales interact with reasoning.

Overall, the approach and evaluations in this paper help address key challenges around faithfulness and annotation costs for rationale-based reasoning. The novel components like counterfactual regularization and prompted rationalization align with emerging techniques while also providing new ways to improve faithfulness. The analyses also give useful insights into rationale-reasoning dynamics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Developing better methods for evaluating the faithfulness and helpfulness of generated rationales. The authors note that evaluating rationale quality remains an open challenge. 

- Extending the approach to other tasks and domains beyond QA datasets. The paper focuses on commonsense reasoning QA datasets, but the approach could potentially be applied to other types of reasoning tasks.

- Scaling up the rationalizing module to even larger pretrained LMs. The paper uses a 20B parameter LM, but notes that prompting even larger LMs could further improve performance.

- Refining the counterfactual training techniques for improved regularization. The paper proposes masking and replacing rationale tokens, but other perturbation strategies could be explored.

- Incorporating external knowledge more directly, rather than just via the pretrained LM. The authors suggest incorporating knowledge graphs or retrieved evidence could further improve reasoning.

- Developing methods to iteratively refine generated rationales. The paper shows providing human rationales improves performance, suggesting iteratively editing machine rationales could also be beneficial.

- Exploring different reasoning module architectures besides the standard Transformer LM. Other architectures may be better suited for leveraging rationales.

- Studying the interplay between faithfulness and accuracy more deeply. There is still an open question regarding whether the two objectives are fully aligned.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving rationale quality, generalization, counterfactual training, knowledge incorporation, iterative refinement, reasoning architectures, and deeper analysis of faithfulness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PINTO, a pipeline method for generating free-text rationales to explain the predictions of a language model on question answering tasks. PINTO has two components - a rationalizing module and a reasoning module. The rationalizing module is a large, frozen pretrained language model that generates choice-specific rationales for a given question and answer choices using prompt-based learning, without requiring extra training or rationale annotations. The reasoning module is a smaller fined-tuned language model that makes predictions on the QA task using the question, choices, and generated rationales as input. To ensure the rationales are used faithfully, the reasoning module is trained with a counterfactual regularization loss that penalizes overconfident predictions when the rationales are masked or perturbed. Experiments on several QA datasets show PINTO improves generalization and out-of-distribution performance compared to baselines, while also yielding rationales that are more faithful to the model's predictions. The method provides a way to transfer knowledge from large pretrained LMs into more interpretable models without expensive annotation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper proposes PINTO, a language model pipeline for generating and reasoning over free-text rationales. PINTO consists of a rationalizing module and a reasoning module. The rationalizing module is a medium-scale pretrained language model that generates choice-specific rationales from a prompt with a few question-answer-rationale examples. The reasoning module is a smaller fine-tuned language model that predicts the answer based on the question, choices, and generated rationales. To ensure the rationales are used properly, the reasoning module is trained with counterfactual regularization, where it gets noisy labels when rationales are perturbed. Experiments on 4 QA datasets show PINTO improves accuracy and rationale-label association over baselines, demonstrating the benefits of prompt-based rationale generation and counterfactual training for faithful reasoning.

Paragraph 2: Through experiments, PINTO is shown to achieve higher accuracy than baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. Analysis reveals PINTO's counterfactual regularization helps improve low-resource performance and model refinement based on rationales. Perturbing rationales via token replacement is more effective than masking for counterfactual training. Overall, the results demonstrate that PINTO's prompted rationalization and counterfactual reasoning lead to performance gains in accuracy, faithfulness, and generalizability. The findings showcase the potential of prompt-based knowledge transfer and counterfactual regularization for improving language models' reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes PINTO, a two-stage pipeline for generating free-text rationales and using them to make predictions on question answering tasks. The first stage is a "rationalizing module" which uses a medium-scale pretrained language model (GPT-NeoX) that is frozen and prompted to generate a rationale for each answer choice given a question. This allows the LM to retrieve relevant knowledge from its parameters without being influenced by spurious correlations in the downstream training data. The second stage is a "reasoning module" which is a smaller transformer LM (T5-Base) that is fine-tuned on the task using the generated rationales as additional context. Crucially, the reasoning module is regularized via counterfactual training - it is trained to output less confident predictions when the rationale is perturbed through masking or replacing tokens. This encourages the reasoning module to properly leverage the rationale, rather than exploiting shortcuts in the input. Experiments across four QA datasets show this pipeline improves generalization and out-of-distribution performance compared to baselines, while also utilizing the rationales more faithfully.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, this paper is addressing the problem of how to build interpretable neural language models that can generate explanations to justify their predictions on commonsense reasoning tasks. 

Specifically, the paper discusses that neural language models have shown impressive performance on commonsense reasoning tasks, but due to their blackbox nature, it's unclear what knowledge they are using and whether it constitutes generalizable reasoning. To address this, prior work has tried generating free-text rationales using the model's internal knowledge to explain its predictions. However, existing methods for rationale generation have limitations around performance, efficiency, and assurance that the rationales faithfully reflect the model's reasoning process. 

The key question this paper tries to address is how to develop a system that can generate free-text rationales to explain commonsense reasoning predictions, while ensuring the rationales are faithful and improve the model's generalization ability. The proposed method, PINTO, introduces a pipeline approach with a prompted rationalization module and counterfactually regularized reasoning module to achieve these goals.

In summary, the core problem is developing neural language models that can provide faithful and helpful rationales to explain their commonsense reasoning, rather than exploiting spurious correlations. The key question is how to build such a rationale-based reasoning system that generates high-quality explanations while improving generalization performance.
