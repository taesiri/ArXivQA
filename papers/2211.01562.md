# PINTO: Faithful Language Reasoning Using Prompt-Generated Rationales

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we build an interpretable model that can generate free-text rationales to reveal its reasoning process before making a prediction, while ensuring the faithfulness of the rationales to the model's predictions?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A pipeline approach with separate modules for rationalization and reasoning can improve both performance and faithfulness compared to prior methods. 2) Prompt-based learning can be used for the rationalization module to avoid expensive human rationale annotation.3) Counterfactual regularization during training can help ensure the reasoning module properly utilizes the generated rationales.4) Faithful reasoning based on rationales can improve the model's generalization ability.So in summary, the central focus seems to be developing techniques to produce free-text rationales that faithfully reflect the model's reasoning, with the goals of improving performance, interpretability and generalization. The key ideas are using prompt-based learning for rationale generation and counterfactual regularization to connect the rationales with the model's predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting PINTO, a method for generating free-text rationales to explain neural language model predictions, while ensuring the rationales are used faithfully. Specifically:- PINTO uses a large frozen language model to generate rationales via prompt-based learning, avoiding the need for expensive rationale annotation. - A smaller reasoning module is trained to make predictions using the generated rationales as context. - Crucially, the reasoning module is regularized via counterfactual training to reduce its confidence when rationales are perturbed, enforcing faithful reliance on them.- Experiments across 4 QA datasets show PINTO improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy compared to baselines. The rationales are also shown to be more faithful in explaining the reasoning module's predictions.In summary, the key contribution is a new rationale-based reasoning paradigm that generates free-text rationales without annotations, and ensures they are used properly via counterfactual training. This improves performance while providing more reliable rationales to explain the model's reasoning process.
