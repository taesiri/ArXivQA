# [WikiWhy: Answering and Explaining Cause-and-Effect Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12152)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we create a question answering dataset to better assess the reasoning capabilities of large language models? 

The key points are:

- Existing QA datasets are limited in their ability to measure reasoning skills, as they focus on retrieving factoids or conducting multi-hop fact chaining. 

- The authors propose that "why" questions requiring explanations can better probe for reasoning skills.

- They introduce WikiWhy, a new QA dataset containing "why" questions along with answers and multi-sentence rationales explaining the answers. 

- The aim is to use WikiWhy to analyze whether LLMs can generate satisfactory explanations demonstrating reasoning skills and commonsense knowledge, rather than just memorization.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a QA dataset, using "why" questions and explanations, that can better measure the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The hypothesis is that models will struggle to produce complete and logically valid explanations for WikiWhy compared to just retrieving answers, indicating deficiencies in reasoning skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing WikiWhy, a new question answering dataset for testing reasoning capabilities of large language models. Specifically:

- WikiWhy contains over 9,000 "why" question-answer-rationale triples grounded in Wikipedia facts across diverse topics. 

- Each rationale is a set of supporting statements explaining why the answer is true, aiming to require models to demonstrate understanding rather than just memorization. 

- Experiments show state-of-the-art generative models like GPT-3 struggle to produce satisfying explanations, with only 38.7% correctness based on human evaluation. 

- The paper proposes new automatic metrics for evaluating free-form explanation generation, and shows these correlate with human judgments of explanation quality.

In summary, the key contribution is the creation of WikiWhy as a new benchmark for probing and improving reasoning skills of large language models, which requires generating explicit explanations justifying answers using common sense knowledge. Baseline results leave significant room for future improvement on this challenging task.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my understanding of the paper and related work in explainable question answering, here are some key comparisons:

- Scope: The paper introduces WikiWhy, a new QA dataset focused on explaining cause-effect relations, spanning 11 diverse topics sourced from Wikipedia. This is broader in scope compared to previous explainable QA datasets like CoS-E, eQASC, and EntailmentBank that cover mainly a single domain (commonsense, grade school science). 

- Explanation Structure: WikiWhy uses rationale sets or chains, which provide more flexibility than fixed-length explanations in some datasets, while staying more natural than complex entailment trees. This aims to balance complexity and scalability.

- Task Format: Many prior datasets focus on selecting or retrieving explanations. WikiWhy aims to be fully generative without giving the model access to an explanation corpus during training/inference. This makes the task more challenging.

- Scale: At over 9000 QA pairs, WikiWhy is moderately sized compared to some other benchmarks. But it is larger than several specialized explainable QA datasets like eQASC and EntailmentBank.

- Evaluation: The paper proposes new automatic metrics to evaluate free-form explanation generation, using ideas like longest common subsequence to align steps. It analyzes metric validity through human correlations.

- Results: Experiments with strong baselines like GPT-3 show significant room for improving explanation quality, with only 38.7% human-rated correctness on the end-to-end task. This highlights the difficulty of the dataset compared to model capabilities.

In summary, WikiWhy pushes research forward in scale, domain breadth, explanation structure, and task formulation compared to related explainable QA datasets. The paper's experiments and proposed evaluation metrics also facilitate benchmarking progress on this reasoning task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for free-form text generation tasks like explanation generation. The authors propose some initial metrics but note there is room for improvement. They suggest developing metrics that better correlate with human judgments of explanation correctness. 

- Continued work on generative explanation models and reasoning tasks. The authors establish baselines on the WikiWhy dataset but note there is significant room for improvement, especially on the end-to-end "answer and explain" task. They motivate further research on generative explanation models.

- Analysis of reasoning gaps in large language models. The authors suggest certain incorrect or incomplete explanations may indicate gaps in commonsense reasoning ability of models like GPT-3. They propose the WikiWhy dataset could be used for further diagnosis of these gaps.

- Multimodal approaches to capture implicit commonsense knowledge. The authors note WikiWhy requires implicit commonsense knowledge unlikely to be present in the training text alone. They suggest multimodal self-supervised approaches as a way to potentially learn this kind of intuitive knowledge.

- Expanding the scope of explanation datasets. The authors highlight the broader coverage of topics in WikiWhy compared to prior explanation datasets. They motivate continued work on diverse explanation datasets covering a wide range of concepts and situations.

In summary, the main directions include improving evaluation of generated explanations, advancing generative explanation models, analyzing reasoning gaps, incorporating multimodal knowledge, and expanding the scope of explanation datasets. The authors frame WikiWhy as a valuable resource for research in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWhy, a new question answering dataset focused on explaining cause-and-effect relations. WikiWhy contains over 9,000 question-answer-rationale triples grounded in Wikipedia facts across 11 diverse topics. Each rationale is a set of statements connecting the question to the answer, requiring models to demonstrate reasoning and knowledge beyond simple memorization. Experiments with GPT-2 and GPT-3 show current generative models struggle to produce satisfactory explanations, achieving only 38.7% correctness when jointly predicting answers and explanations. The authors propose new automatic evaluation metrics to compare free-form explanation text, finding similarity to references correlates with human judgments of correctness. Overall, WikiWhy serves as a challenging benchmark to analyze reasoning capabilities of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWhy, a new question answering dataset for testing the reasoning abilities of large language models. WikiWhy contains over 9,000 "why" question-answer pairs, where each answer is accompanied by a rationale explaining why the answer is true. The rationales consist of multiple supporting statements that connect the question to the answer, making WikiWhy more challenging than datasets that just require retrieving factoids. 

The authors demonstrate that current state-of-the-art generative models like GPT-3 struggle to produce good explanations on WikiWhy, achieving only 38.7% correctness based on human evaluation. They also introduce new automatic metrics for evaluating free-form explanation generation, and show these metrics correlate with human judgments of explanation quality. Overall, WikiWhy serves as a useful benchmark for analyzing and improving reasoning in large language models, covering a broad range of topics and requiring deeper multi-hop reasoning compared to prior QA datasets. The low performance of strong baselines indicates significant room for future work in this area.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces WikiWhy, a new question answering dataset for testing reasoning capabilities of large language models. The key idea is that each question-answer pair in WikiWhy has an associated rationale - a set of supporting statements that explain why the answer is true. To create the dataset, the authors extract cause-effect relations from Wikipedia passages using causal keywords. Crowdworkers then reframe these into why-questions and provide multi-hop explanations connecting the cause (which becomes the answer) to the effect. The explanations have flexible set or chain topologies. The authors test baselines like GPT-2 and GPT-3 on generating explanations for provided cause-effect pairs, as well as end-to-end answering and explaining from just the question. Both automatic metrics and human evaluation show significant room for improvement, indicating WikiWhy poses a challenging reasoning task. Overall, the main method is the novel dataset collection procedure to create explanatory rationale for QA pairs, along with generative baselines and evaluations.
