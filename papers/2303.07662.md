# [One scalar is all you need -- absolute depth estimation using monocular   self-supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07662)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to transfer the depth scale from datasets with ground truth depth to a monocular depth estimator trained with self-supervision on a new dataset without ground truth depth. The key hypothesis is that the relationship between predicted up-to-scale depth and ground truth depth is linear across images from different datasets. This enables using a global depth scaling factor learned on a source dataset to convert predicted up-to-scale depth to absolute depth on a target dataset.In summary, the paper aims to solve the scale ambiguity issue in self-supervised monocular depth estimation by transferring depth scale from existing datasets with ground truth depth. The key idea is that depth rankings are linearly correlated across datasets, allowing a global depth scaling factor to be applied.
