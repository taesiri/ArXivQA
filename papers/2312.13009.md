# [EMG-based Control Strategies of a Supernumerary Robotic Hand for the   Rehabilitation of Sub-Acute Stroke Patients: Proof of Concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stroke often causes upper limb disability, with loss of hand functionality. Starting rehabilitation in the sub-acute phase (first 3 months) is most effective for recovery. 
- Task-specific training (TST) of the impaired hand is effective but often not possible due to lack of strength or risk of increasing spasticity. 
- Existing robotic assistive devices require some residual mobility to control, limiting their applicability. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use a supernumerary robotic hand called SoftHand-X secured to patient's forearm to provide extra grasping capability.
- Control the hand using surface EMG signals from patient's extensor muscles to detect intention to open hand. 
- Test two EMG control strategies: (1) On-Off control to fully open/close hand when signal exceeds a threshold (2) Proportional control to modulate aperture proportional to EMG level.

Contributions:
- Show EMG signal can detect intention to move even in absence of visible motion in sub-acute patients
- Simple 1-sensor setup still robust against stroke-corrupted EMG signals 
- On-Off control effective for TST as requires less effort from patient
- Therapist can adjust EMG threshold in real-time to customize to patient
- Positive testing on 4 sub-acute stroke patients indicates viability to extend TST to more severe cases

In summary, the paper demonstrates a practical EMG-driven supernumerary robotic hand system to provide grasping assistance for more intensive and effective task-specific hand rehabilitation in sub-acute stroke patients. The simple but adaptable control scheme makes it accessible even soon after a stroke when residual mobility is low.
