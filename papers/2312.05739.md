## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The proliferation of fake news on social media has become a pressing issue, as it misleads public perceptions and impacts social stability. Although deep learning methods have enhanced fake news detection by analyzing news content, they overlook the social context during news propagation. Graph-based techniques incorporate this context but require large labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes an unsupervised fake news detection method called GAMC (Graph Autoencoder with Masking and Contrastive learning) that eliminates the need for labeled data. GAMC models news propagation as a graph and performs data augmentation by feature masking and edge dropping to create two enhanced graphs. A graph encoder then generates latent representations capturing both context and content. A decoder reconstructs the graphs, and a composite loss with reconstruction error and contrast loss is minimized to teach effective feature learning and enforce consistency across augmented graphs.

Key Contributions:
1) Introduces self-supervised learning to fake news detection, removing dependence on labeled data.
2) Proposes a graph autoencoder integrating reconstruction error loss and contrast loss for robust feature learning. 
3) Validates superior performance over benchmark methods on real-world datasets, demonstrating efficacy of model.

The unsupervised nature of GAMC makes it widely applicable for fake news detection scenarios with limited labeled data. Its graph-based modeling also effectively encodes the social context of news propagation. By teaching the model to leverage both context and content as self-supervision, GAMC pushes the boundaries of fake news detection.
