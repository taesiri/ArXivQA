# [Multi-hop Question Answering under Temporal Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00492)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-hop question answering (MQA) requires complex reasoning over multiple facts to derive the final answer. 
- Existing MQA methods perform poorly when new knowledge needs to be incorporated without forgetting old knowledge, a task known as knowledge editing (KE).  
- They particularly struggle with questions having explicit temporal context, as most store edits in an unstructured format.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called TEMPorLEMQA for MQA under temporal knowledge editing. 
- It constructs a Time-Aware Graph (TAG) to store edit knowledge in a structured format, preserving temporal contexts.  
- An inference path is generated leveraging pre-trained language models (LLMs) to decompose the reasoning chain for a given question.
- A structural retrieval mechanism is proposed to effectively query relevant knowledge from TAG by analyzing semantic similarities along multiple dimensions like relations, concepts etc.  
- Finally, joint reasoning is performed over the inference path using LLMs and retrieved knowledge from TAG to answer the question.

Main Contributions:
- A new method TEMPorLEMQA that can perform reliable MQA under significant volumes of temporal knowledge editing without forgetting historical facts.
- Introduction of time-aware graph and specialized prompting techniques to store edit knowledge in a structured format.
- A novel procedure for planning, specialized structural retrieval for knowledge graphs, and joint reasoning for answering.
- Extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over 7 baselines on multiple benchmarks. 
- A new benchmark dataset TKEMQA, specifically designed for evaluating MQA with temporal scopes.
