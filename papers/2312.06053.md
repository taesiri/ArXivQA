# [IEKG: A Commonsense Knowledge Graph for Idiomatic Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06053)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph called IEKG (Idiomatic Expression Knowledge Graph) that focuses specifically on representing commonsense knowledge related to the figurative interpretations and usage of idiomatic expressions (IEs). The goal is to provide explicit IE knowledge to enable neural models to better comprehend IEs. IEKG extends the ATOMIC knowledge graph by adding 56k knowledge tuples covering over 1200 IEs using 11 relation types that describe causes, effects, intents, reactions, etc. related to the subject and object of an IE event. 

Experiments demonstrate IEKG's high quality via human and automatic evaluation. When used to train knowledge models, IEKG generalizes better to unseen IEs and unseen relations compared to only using ATOMIC. Applications show that injecting IEKG knowledge significantly benefits neural models on IE comprehension tasks like natural language inference and continuation classification, outperforming both baseline pretrained models and models fine-tuned only on task-specific datasets. For example, on the IMPLI natural language inference benchmark containing IEs, an IEKG-injected BART model achieves state-of-the-art performance, even generalizing to unseen IEs. Overall, explicitly representing figurative IE knowledge in IEKG enables neural models to achieve better IE comprehension abilities.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Idiomatic expressions (IEs) are challenging for natural language processing systems to comprehend due to their non-compositional nature. Prior work has focused on learning IE representations implicitly from limited idiomatic sentences. However, the contextual information in these sentences is often sparse, making it difficult for models to learn the meanings of IEs. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes IEKG, a commonsense knowledge graph focused on figurative interpretations of IEs. IEKG organizes knowledge related to 1,229 IEs and 11 relation types covering causes, effects, attributes etc. It has over 56K knowledge tuples created via human annotation. 

The paper shows IEKG can be used to train knowledge models by transforming various pre-trained language models like BERT, BART etc. on the knowledge tuple completion task. Experiments demonstrate trained knowledge models have improved ability to complete unseen knowledge tuples of seen IEs and generalize to unseen IEs.

The paper also shows injecting knowledge from IEKG improves IE comprehension. A BART model injected with IEKG knowledge achieves state-of-the-art results on natural language inference using the IMPLI benchmark containing IEs. It also shows significant gains on a continuation classification task using the Figurative Narrative Benchmark.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes IEKG, a commonsense knowledge graph focused on figurative interpretations of idioms with over 56K tuples.

2) Demonstrates IEKG can transform various pre-trained language models into knowledge models for idiom knowledge inference and generalization.

3) Shows injecting IEKG knowledge improves pre-trained language model's IE comprehension ability, achieving SOTA results on IE NLI and sizable gains on continuation classification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a commonsense knowledge graph called IEKG that provides explicit figurative interpretations of idiomatic expressions, which can then be used to inject knowledge into pre-trained language models to improve their idiomatic expression comprehension ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors propose IEKG, a commonsense knowledge graph focusing on idiomatic expressions (IEs). IEKG organizes figurative interpretations of IEs using reasoning types that cover the effects, causes, and attributes for both the subject and object in an IE.

2) The authors show that various pre-trained language models (PTLMs) can be converted into knowledge models (KMs) that can encode and infer commonsense knowledge related to IE usage by training on IEKG. Compared to a KM trained on ATOMIC, IE-aware KMs can better generalize to unseen IEs and unseen relations for seen IEs on an IE knowledge tuple completion task. 

3) Through applications in natural language understanding tasks involving IEs, the authors demonstrate that injecting knowledge from IEKG into PTLMs improves their IE comprehension ability. A PTLM injected with IEKG knowledge achieves state-of-the-art results on an IE natural language inference benchmark and significantly outperforms a baseline PTLM on a continuation classification task.

In summary, the main contribution is the construction of IEKG and showing its utility for equipping PTLMs with explicit commonsense knowledge to better comprehend idiomatic expressions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Idiomatic expressions (IEs): The paper focuses specifically on enhancing the understanding and processing of idiomatic expressions, which are non-compositional phrases where the meaning is not derived from the component words (e.g. "kick the bucket").

- Knowledge graph (KG): The authors construct a new commonsense knowledge graph called IEKG that organizes information about the figurative interpretations and usage of idiomatic expressions. 

- Knowledge model (KM): Various pre-trained language models are adapted into knowledge models that can complete knowledge tuples from the IEKG, encoding idiom-related commonsense reasoning.

- Knowledge injection: The IEKG is directly injected into pre-trained language models to imbue them with explicit idiomatic knowledge and improve performance on idiom comprehension tasks. 

- Tasks: Key applications explored include natural language inference and continuation classification in the presence of idioms. Performance gains are demonstrated after IEKG injection compared to baseline PTLM models.

- Generalization: An important capability is being able to generalize idiom knowledge to unseen expressions not covered in the IEKG knowledge graph. Experiments aim to evaluate this out-of-graph generalization.

In summary, the core focus is on representing and injecting knowledge about idiomatic expressions to enhance language model understanding, using the constructed IEKG resource. Evaluations center around idiom-related reasoning and generalization abilities.
