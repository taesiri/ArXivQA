# [IEKG: A Commonsense Knowledge Graph for Idiomatic Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06053)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph called IEKG (Idiomatic Expression Knowledge Graph) that focuses specifically on representing commonsense knowledge related to the figurative interpretations and usage of idiomatic expressions (IEs). The goal is to provide explicit IE knowledge to enable neural models to better comprehend IEs. IEKG extends the ATOMIC knowledge graph by adding 56k knowledge tuples covering over 1200 IEs using 11 relation types that describe causes, effects, intents, reactions, etc. related to the subject and object of an IE event. 

Experiments demonstrate IEKG's high quality via human and automatic evaluation. When used to train knowledge models, IEKG generalizes better to unseen IEs and unseen relations compared to only using ATOMIC. Applications show that injecting IEKG knowledge significantly benefits neural models on IE comprehension tasks like natural language inference and continuation classification, outperforming both baseline pretrained models and models fine-tuned only on task-specific datasets. For example, on the IMPLI natural language inference benchmark containing IEs, an IEKG-injected BART model achieves state-of-the-art performance, even generalizing to unseen IEs. Overall, explicitly representing figurative IE knowledge in IEKG enables neural models to achieve better IE comprehension abilities.
