# [Training-Free Pretrained Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01753)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing model merging methods either require additional training/fine-tuning which is computationally expensive, or can only merge models with the same pre-trained initialization which severely limits applicability. 
- Current unit matching methods rely solely on similarity in either weight space or activation space. But similarity in these two spaces is not always consistent, which leads to poor matching.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new model merging framework called "Merging under Dual-Space Constraints (MuDSC)" that encourages similarity in both weight space and activation space. 
- MuDSC linearly combines the similarity matrices in both spaces to find better matched units. This is theoretically equivalent to optimizing objectives in both spaces simultaneously.
- An iterative algorithm is used to resolve contradictions between weight space matching and activation space matching.
- Adaptations to support merging models with group norm or multi-head attention are also provided.

Main Contributions:
- Highlights inconsistency between weight and activation similarity during model merging, and shows impact of this through experiment.
- Proposes MuDSC framework to address this inconsistency by matching under constraints from both weight and activation spaces.
- Shows MuDSC boosts performance significantly over prior arts in multiple experiments (homogenous tasks, heterogenous tasks, large-scale data).
- Visualizes MuDSC merged model in multi-task loss landscape and shows it resides in overlapping lower loss region.

In summary, the key innovation is constraining model merging using dual similarities to achieve better matched units and improved multi-task performance.
