# [Language Model Adaptation to Specialized Domains through Selective   Masking based on Genre and Topical Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models like BERT use random word masking during training, which may disregard domain-specific linguistic attributes when adapting the model to specialized domains.
- More selective masking strategies are needed to tailor language models to specialized domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an innovative masking approach that leverages genre and topicality information to guide the masking procedure when adapting models to specialized domains. 
- Two scoring methods are used to prioritize words for masking:
   - MetaDiscourse score: Assesses words based on how characteristic they are of a particular text genre, using meta-discourse markers.
   - TF-IDF score: Evaluates words based on their topical salience within a document compared to the whole corpus.
- These scored words are then selectively masked during continued pre-training of BERT on a legal domain corpus. 

Main Contributions:
- Proposes original masking strategies for language model training based on meta-discourse and TF-IDF scoring to identify significant words.
- Develops a systematic approach to incorporate selected words effectively during model training.
- Shows through experiments on the LegalGLUE benchmark that selectively masking words based on genre and topicality information improves model performance in the legal domain compared to random masking.
- Releases pre-trained models and code to facilitate adaptable training of models to specific domains using this selective masking approach.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage indicators of a word's genre and topical significance to determine what gets masked during continued pre-training of language models on specialized corpora, tailoring the model to that domain. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements on legal NLP tasks.
