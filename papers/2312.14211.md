# [Experimenting with Large Language Models and vector embeddings in NASA   SciX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper describes an experiment by the NASA SciX team to utilize large language models (LLMs) to improve information retrieval and data augmentation for their scientific literature database. The key problem they aimed to solve was the issue of "hallucination" - when LLMs generate fictional responses because they lack the relevant knowledge or context. 

To address this, they implemented a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system. This involves prompting the LLM with the user's question along with relevant text snippets from the literature. The snippets provide context to ground the LLM's response in reality. They experimented with different strategies to select good snippets, including:

1) Using a separate LLM to translate questions into queries for the SciX search engine. This retrieves relevant abstracts. 

2) Creating semantic vector embeddings of paragraphs from full text articles. Closest vectors to the question vector are retrieved as snippets.

They built a web interface and API to interact with the LLMs. Based on subjective human evaluation, RAG with full text snippets produced the best quality responses with less hallucination. 

The experiment demonstrated the potential for LLMs to improve SciX's capabilities while respecting data copyright and user privacy. It also highlighted the importance of grounding the models in relevant data to reduce fictional responses. Further work is needed to design additional SciX features leveraging this technology. But overall it opens up new possibilities for better serving users via LLMs.
