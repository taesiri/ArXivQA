# [Composed Video Retrieval via Enriched Context and Discriminative   Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16997)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on the problem of composed video retrieval (CoVR). In CoVR, the goal is to retrieve a target video from a database that matches the visual content of a query video but incorporates desired modifications specified in text. 
- CoVR is challenging because it requires bridging the domain gap between the query video and modification text, and simultaneously aligning the multi-modal embeddings with the dynamic target video embeddings.
- Existing methods like CoVR-BLIP rely only on visual query features and struggle to preserve query-specific context.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a CoVR framework that leverages detailed language descriptions of the query video, in addition to the visual query and modification text.
- Detailed descriptions are automatically generated using a multi-modal conversational model to provide complementary contextual information.
- The framework learns discriminative embeddings of vision, text and vision-text features using multiple target datasets and alignments.
- This allows better encoding of query context and its alignment to target videos.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces detailed language descriptions to preserve query context and reduce gap with modification text.
- Learns complementary discriminative embeddings of vision, text and vision-text for alignment.  
- Achieves new SOTA results on WebVid-CoVR dataset with 7% higher recall.
- Shows strong generalization to image retrieval tasks in zero-shot transfer learning.
- Provides new benchmark results across three datasets - WebVid-CoVR, CIRR and FashionIQ.

In summary, the key innovation is using detailed language descriptions for context modeling and learning multi-modal discriminative embeddings for superior alignment and video retrieval performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel composed video retrieval framework that leverages detailed language descriptions to explicitly encode query-specific contextual information, learns discriminative embeddings of vision, text and vision-text for better alignment, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on composed video and image retrieval tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework for composed video retrieval (CoVR) that leverages detailed language descriptions to explicitly encode query-specific contextual information. This helps reduce the domain gap with the change text and enables learning discriminative embeddings of vision, text, and vision-text for better alignment between the composed query and target videos. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Using a multi-modal conversational model to generate detailed textual descriptions of the query video to complement the visual input. This provides richer context and semantics. 

2) Learning joint multi-modal embeddings by fusing embeddings of the query video, detailed description, and change text. This encodes the necessary context to alter the video composition based on the change text.

3) Employing multiple target datasets based on visual, multi-modal, and text embeddings of videos during training for enhanced diversity and alignment. 

4) State-of-the-art performance on CoVR using the WebVid-CoVR benchmark, with gains of up to 7% in recall@1 score over prior works. The approach also shows strong zero-shot transfer capabilities on composed image retrieval tasks.

In summary, the novelty lies in using detailed language descriptions and learning discriminative joint embeddings for effectively aligning the composed query to target videos in CoVR.
