# [Middleware for LLMs: Tools Are Instrumental for Language Agents in   Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive language capabilities, but their true potential is to act as generalist language agents that can aid humans across complex real-world tasks. 
- Many real-world tasks involve interacting with complex environments like large knowledge bases or databases. Directly feeding the full environment description into the LLM's limited context window faces severe scalability issues.

Proposed Solution:
- Equip LLMs with customized tools tailored for different complex environments, which serve as middleware between the LLM and environment.
- Tools provide comprehensive functionality to navigate and query the environment on-demand, shielding the LLM from full complexity.
- Adapt the ReAct algorithm to tightly couple tool usage with the LLM's reasoning through chain-of-thought. Add strategies to enhance action prediction accuracy.
- Overall framework called Fuxi allows investigating LLM potential in complex environments when aided by tools.

Experiments and Results: 
- Implement and evaluate Fuxi in two complex environments - knowledge bases and databases, using tailored toolsets.
- Test on appropriate benchmarks featuring complexity and instructions mirroring real-world situations.
- Significantly outperforms all baselines across metrics, almost doubling or tripling performance. Underscores critical role of tools.
- Analysis shows tools enable LLM to flexibly gather necessary info on-demand, overcoming context window limitations.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the framework Fuxi to equip LLMs with customized tools as middleware for handling complex environments.
- Comprehensive toolsets implemented for knowledge bases and databases grounded in domain expertise.
- Carefully chosen benchmarks providing proper testbed for language agents.
- Extensive experiments demonstrating great promise of tool-enhanced LLMs in complex real-world tasks.
