# [AniFaceDrawing: Anime Portrait Exploration during Your Sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07476)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can AI be used to assist users in creating high-quality anime portraits from rough freehand sketches throughout the entire sketching process?Specifically, the paper focuses on developing an AI system that can take a sequence of incomplete freehand sketches as input, and generate corresponding high-quality anime portraits as guidance to match the sketches and assist the user in creating the portrait. The key challenges are:- Maintaining high quality anime portrait generation from very rough and incomplete sketches during early sketching stages due to the ill-posed nature of conditional image generation.- Achieving stroke-level matching between the input sketches and generated portraits throughout the sketching process.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel approach based on latent space exploration of StyleGAN using a two-stage training strategy and stroke-level disentanglement learning, without requiring additional paired data. Experiments and user studies demonstrate the proposed system can generate high-quality matched portraits to assist users in creating anime portraits from scratch.In summary, the core hypothesis is that by using the proposed latent space exploration and disentanglement learning approach, an AI system can achieve stroke-level matching to assist in anime portrait creation from freehand sketches throughout the drawing process. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing an AI system to assist users in creating high quality anime portraits from their freehand sketches. Specifically:- They propose a novel framework called "AniFaceDrawing" that can generate high quality anime portraits matching a user's sketch strokes throughout the entire drawing process. - They introduce the concept of "stroke-level disentanglement" which allows mapping sketch strokes to the corresponding parts of the anime portrait at a local level without needing semantic labels. This is achieved through a two-stage training strategy.- They simulate the drawing process on-the-fly during training to teach the system how sketches evolve from simple to complex. This allows it to handle progressive and incomplete sketches.- They conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in generating high quality and locally matching anime portraits from rough sketches.- They validate the system through a user study, showing it can assist novice users in creating anime portraits following their intentions and improving their sketches.In summary, the key contribution is developing an end-to-end AI framework for interactive anime portrait drawing assistance that can generate high quality results matched to the user's sketch throughout the drawing process. The proposed "stroke-level disentanglement" concept and training strategy enables handling progressive rough sketches.
