# [AniFaceDrawing: Anime Portrait Exploration during Your Sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07476)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can AI be used to assist users in creating high-quality anime portraits from rough freehand sketches throughout the entire sketching process?Specifically, the paper focuses on developing an AI system that can take a sequence of incomplete freehand sketches as input, and generate corresponding high-quality anime portraits as guidance to match the sketches and assist the user in creating the portrait. The key challenges are:- Maintaining high quality anime portrait generation from very rough and incomplete sketches during early sketching stages due to the ill-posed nature of conditional image generation.- Achieving stroke-level matching between the input sketches and generated portraits throughout the sketching process.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel approach based on latent space exploration of StyleGAN using a two-stage training strategy and stroke-level disentanglement learning, without requiring additional paired data. Experiments and user studies demonstrate the proposed system can generate high-quality matched portraits to assist users in creating anime portraits from scratch.In summary, the core hypothesis is that by using the proposed latent space exploration and disentanglement learning approach, an AI system can achieve stroke-level matching to assist in anime portrait creation from freehand sketches throughout the drawing process. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.
