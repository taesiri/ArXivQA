# [Quadrupedal Locomotion Control On Inclined Surfaces Using Collocation   Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08621)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a control strategy for a quadrupedal robot called Husky Carbon to traverse steep slopes, inspired by the wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) maneuver performed by chukar birds. The authors leverage Husky Carbon's unique design featuring four onboard thrusters to generate external forces that can manipulate ground reaction forces and friction cone limits, allowing the robot to walk on slopes up to 45 degrees. They develop a high-fidelity SimScape model of Husky Carbon as well as a reduced-order model (HROM) to rapidly compute optimal joint torque and thruster force inputs using a collocation approach. The collocation controller synchronously manipulates the leg motions and thruster forces to satisfy friction cone constraints and achieve stable locomotion on inclined surfaces. Through simulations, they demonstrate Husky Carbon traversing various slope angles from 0 to 45 degrees using fixed gaits while satisfying constraints. The work provides a foundation to implement WAIR on the physical Husky Carbon robot for unmatched mobility.
