# [Quadrupedal Locomotion Control On Inclined Surfaces Using Collocation   Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08621)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a control strategy for a quadrupedal robot called Husky Carbon to traverse steep slopes, inspired by the wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) maneuver performed by chukar birds. The authors leverage Husky Carbon's unique design featuring four onboard thrusters to generate external forces that can manipulate ground reaction forces and friction cone limits, allowing the robot to walk on slopes up to 45 degrees. They develop a high-fidelity SimScape model of Husky Carbon as well as a reduced-order model (HROM) to rapidly compute optimal joint torque and thruster force inputs using a collocation approach. The collocation controller synchronously manipulates the leg motions and thruster forces to satisfy friction cone constraints and achieve stable locomotion on inclined surfaces. Through simulations, they demonstrate Husky Carbon traversing various slope angles from 0 to 45 degrees using fixed gaits while satisfying constraints. The work provides a foundation to implement WAIR on the physical Husky Carbon robot for unmatched mobility.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inspired by chukar birds that use wing flapping to assist with running up steep slopes (wing-assisted incline running or WAIR), the authors aim to develop controls for a quadruped robot called Husky Carbon to climb slopes using both leg forces and thrust from onboard ducted fans. 
- Climbing steep slopes is challenging for legged robots as friction cone limits on feet contacts with the ground can be violated, leading to slipping.  Using both leg forces and thruster forces provides more control authority.

Proposed Solution:
- A high fidelity dynamical model of Husky Carbon with 18 degrees of freedom is created in SimScape. This includes distributed masses and compliant ground contact models.
- A simplified 6 degree of freedom reduced order model (HROM) is also derived, with massless legs and thruster forces applied to the body center of mass.
- For control, a direct collocation approach is used with the HROM discretized over N time samples. A cubic interpolation method is used to approximate the states and inputs between samples, greatly speeding up the optimization.
- The collocation optimization minimizes tracking error of body states to references while satisfying ground friction cone constraints. It calculates optimal leg joint accelerations and thruster forces over the maneuver.

Key Contributions:
- First work to develop controls for wing-assisted incline running with a quadrupedal robot using both leg forces and thrusters.
- Rapid collocation optimization approach with interpolated dynamics fitting to handle the complexity of controlling many degrees of freedom.
- Demonstrated in simulation the ability to climb slopes up to 45 degrees without violating ground friction constraints.

In summary, the key idea is leveraging both leg and thruster forces in a optimized control framework to expand mobility for legged systems to traverse steep slopes they couldn't with legs alone. The interpolating collocation method provides an efficient way to calculate these controls.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a collocation-based control method using a reduced-order model to rapidly compute optimal joint motions and thruster forces that enable a quadrupedal robot called Husky Carbon to walk up steep slopes of up to 45 degrees, inspired by wing-assisted incline running of birds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The proposition of a novel collocation method based on approximating the dynamics of Husky for rapid control calculations in the wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) maneuver. Specifically, the authors implement this collocation-based control method to synchronously control joint motions and thrusters forces to traverse steep slopes of up to 45 degrees without violating contact conditions. The paper states that this collocation method will be considered for real-world tests of the WAIR maneuver using the Husky robot.

In summary, the main contribution is a new collocation control method that enables the Husky robot to perform wing-assisted incline running to climb very steep slopes, by coordinating joint motions and thruster forces. This method is intended to be implemented on the real Husky robot in future work.
