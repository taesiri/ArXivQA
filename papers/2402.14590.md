# [Scaling Up LLM Reviews for Google Ads Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14590)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Goal is to accurately detect Google Ads policy violations, especially "Non-Family Safe" violations related to sexual/adult content, across large volume of image ad traffic
- Using large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to high computational costs of running inference on all ads

Proposed Solution:
- Funneling - Use heuristics to filter and select candidate ads for LLM review, including content similarity, actor similarity, deduping, and sampling for diversity
- LLM Labeling - Carefully engineer prompts and tune smaller parameter LLM model for labeling candidates 
- Label Propagation - Propagate LLM labels to similar ads based on content embeddings
- Feedback Loop - Add labeled ads back to funneling stage to find more similar candidates 

Key Contributions:
- End-to-end pipeline to effectively scale up LLM reviews and maximize accuracy under compute constraints
- Funneling stage greatly reduces volume needed for LLM review (400 million to 400k ads)   
- Achieves 2x recall compared to baseline non-LLM model
- Doubles number of labeled ads through propagation
- Helped remove 15% more violating impressions in image ads
- Approach is generalizable to multiple ad formats and policies beyond image ads

In summary, the paper provides an end-to-end solution to efficiently scale up LLM content moderation for Google Ads while maximizing accuracy and coverage across a massive corpus of ads.
