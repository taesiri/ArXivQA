# [Identification of Causal Structure in the Presence of Missing Data with   Additive Noise Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Missing data is ubiquitous in real-world datasets, making causal discovery challenging. 
- Existing methods make the assumption of "no self-masking missingness", where a missing value does not cause its own missingness indicator. This is unrealistic.
- Methods like PC and FCI algorithms fail under "self-masking missingness". They produce incorrect causal skeletons or many equivalent classes.
- Recovering the full joint distribution is impossible under self-masking missingness. So traditional methods cannot be applied directly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows additive noise models (ANMs) can identify causality under certain self-masking missingness. 
- They define "weak self-masking missingness", where missingness depends only on the variable itself.
- Under this assumption, the joint distribution is recoverable conditional on self-masking indicators.
- They extend PC algorithm constraints to allow weak self-masking missingness. This identifies the causal skeleton correctly.
- For causal direction, they introduce "IN-equivalent" patterns to encode ANM constraints. Combined with the skeleton, these patterns identify causality up to an equivalence class.
- An orientation rule is provided to orient more edges in the IN-equivalent pattern.

Main Contributions:
- Allowing and handling weak self-masking missingness in causal discovery. Previous works did not consider this.
- Method to identify causal skeleton under weak self-masking missingness.
- Sufficient conditions for ANMs to identify causality under missingness. 
- Concept of IN-equivalent pattern to encode ANM constraints.
- Orientation rule to further improve causality decisions.
- Algorithms SM-MVPC and LCS-MD that implement the theoretical contributions.

Overall, the paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art in handling missing data for causal discovery. The assumptions are more realistic and the methods demonstrate strong performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the identifiability of learning causal structure from missing data under additive noise models, allowing weak self-masking missingness mechanisms, and shows the causal skeleton is identifiable and the causal direction is identifiable up to an equivalent pattern that encodes the independent noise properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a practical causal skeleton learning algorithm (SM-MVPC) for learning the skeleton among causal variables and missingness indicators in the presence of weak self-masking missingness. 

2. It provides a theoretical analysis of the identification of the additive noise model (ANM) under missing data. Specifically, it gives a sufficient and necessary condition for the identifiability of ANM causal pairs.

3. It shows that by combining the learned causal skeleton and additive noise model, the causal structure can be identified up to an IN-equivalent pattern. An IN-equivalent pattern encodes the set of independent noises of ANMs.  

4. It provides an insightful orientation rule to further orient the undirected edges in the IN-equivalent pattern. This rule orients edges by making sure there is no introduction of new identifiable ANM structures.

In summary, the key contribution is extending causal discovery algorithms to allow weak self-masking missingness and providing theoretical results for identifying causal skeleton and directions under missing data and additive noise models. The proposed methods and theories address an important open problem in causal discovery.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Missing data
- Missingness mechanisms
- Missing completely at random (MCAR) 
- Missing at random (MAR)
- Missing not at random (MNAR)
- Self-masking missingness
- Missingness graphs (m-graphs)
- Additive noise model (ANM)
- Conditional independence (CI) 
- Test-wise deletion
- Causal discovery
- Causal skeleton
- Causal direction
- Independent noise (IN) equivalent pattern
- Weak self-masking missingness assumption
- Identifiability

The paper focuses on the problem of learning causal structure from observational data with missing values, allowing the existence of self-masking missingness variables. It leverages the additive noise model framework and relaxes the typical "no self-masking missingness" assumption. Key contributions include:

1) Extending identifiability of the causal skeleton to allow weak self-masking missingness 
2) Providing conditions for identifying causal direction under additive noise models
3) Characterizing the learning problem using IN-equivalent patterns
4) Proposing algorithms for learning the causal skeleton and directions

The key terms reflect important concepts, assumptions, models, and methods related to these contributions and the overall problem being addressed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes the existence of "weak self-masking missingness." What exactly constitutes weak self-masking missingness and how does allowing this assumption affect identifiability compared to prior work that rules it out? 

2. Proposition 1 provides a method to recover the joint distribution P(V) up to P(V|R_S). Walk through the details of how this recovery is achieved and discuss its theoretical guarantees.

3. Lemma 1 provides a method to identify indicators of self-masking missingness variables. Explain the key intuition behind why the method works, including the role of the "structure condition" assumption.  

4. Theorem 2 states that causal relations of missing indicators are identifiable under the specified assumptions. Prove this result and discuss whether the assumptions can be further relaxed.

5. Theorem 3 characterizes precisely when an additive noise model is identifiable versus non-identifiable in the missing data setting. Provide examples to illustrate the theorem and sketch a proof.

6. Explain intuitively why the "Potential Non-identifiable Paths" definition captures paths that make a variable's ANM non-identifiable due to missingness. Provide examples.  

7. The paper introduces an "IN-equivalent pattern" to encode independency relations in missing data. Discuss how this pattern is constructed and how it can be leveraged algorithmically.

8. The Orientation Rule in Theorem 4 provides a method to further orient undirected edges in the IN-equivalent pattern. Provide an intuitive explanation of why this rule holds and works.

9. Analyze the computational complexity of the full SM-MVPC and LCS-MD algorithms. What are the computational bottlenecks?

10. The theoretical results make quite strong assumptions. Discuss limitations of the method and assumptions that need to be relaxed to make the approach more widely applicable.
