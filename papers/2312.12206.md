# [Identification of Causal Structure in the Presence of Missing Data with   Additive Noise Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Missing data is ubiquitous in real-world datasets, making causal discovery challenging. 
- Existing methods make the assumption of "no self-masking missingness", where a missing value does not cause its own missingness indicator. This is unrealistic.
- Methods like PC and FCI algorithms fail under "self-masking missingness". They produce incorrect causal skeletons or many equivalent classes.
- Recovering the full joint distribution is impossible under self-masking missingness. So traditional methods cannot be applied directly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows additive noise models (ANMs) can identify causality under certain self-masking missingness. 
- They define "weak self-masking missingness", where missingness depends only on the variable itself.
- Under this assumption, the joint distribution is recoverable conditional on self-masking indicators.
- They extend PC algorithm constraints to allow weak self-masking missingness. This identifies the causal skeleton correctly.
- For causal direction, they introduce "IN-equivalent" patterns to encode ANM constraints. Combined with the skeleton, these patterns identify causality up to an equivalence class.
- An orientation rule is provided to orient more edges in the IN-equivalent pattern.

Main Contributions:
- Allowing and handling weak self-masking missingness in causal discovery. Previous works did not consider this.
- Method to identify causal skeleton under weak self-masking missingness.
- Sufficient conditions for ANMs to identify causality under missingness. 
- Concept of IN-equivalent pattern to encode ANM constraints.
- Orientation rule to further improve causality decisions.
- Algorithms SM-MVPC and LCS-MD that implement the theoretical contributions.

Overall, the paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art in handling missing data for causal discovery. The assumptions are more realistic and the methods demonstrate strong performance.
