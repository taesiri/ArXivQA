# [NutritionVerse-Synth: An Open Access Synthetically Generated 2D Food   Scene Dataset for Dietary Intake Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06192)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

NutritionVerse-Synth (NV-Synth) is a large-scale synthetic food image dataset introduced to address the need for diverse and accurately annotated data to advance automated dietary assessment. It contains 84,984 photorealistic meal images algorithmically rendered from 7,082 dynamically composed 3D scenes modeled using real-world food assets from the NutritionVerse-3D dataset. The meal images exhibit diversity in foods, compositions, viewpoints, and lighting and are paired with perfect ground truth annotations including segmentation masks, bounding boxes, depth maps, and detailed nutritional information per ingredient. The data generation framework leverages Nvidia's Isaac Sim physics engine to enable realistic simulation and automatic annotation. NV-Synth highlights the value of configurable synthetic data pipelines for generating rich annotated datasets to overcome limitations of manual approaches. As the largest public open-access synthetic food dataset with scalable pipelines released, NV-Synth provides an essential benchmark to drive innovations in nutrition-aware computer vision and dietary monitoring.
