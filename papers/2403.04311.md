# [ALTO: An Efficient Network Orchestrator for Compound AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Compound AI systems like pipelines of language models are becoming more complex and need to be served efficiently at scale. 
- Generative language models produce outputs incrementally token-by-token. This provides an opportunity to stream intermediate outputs between pipeline stages to reduce latency and increase throughput. 
- However, streaming introduces new challenges around correctness when some stages are stateful and need to aggregate over partial outputs, and around load balancing when different prompts generate varying amounts of outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ALTO, a network orchestrator to address the challenges with streaming compound AI pipelines.
- ALTO provides an "aggregation-aware routing" interface to express routing constraints for stateful stages that need to aggregate partial outputs. This ensures correctness.
- ALTO also proposes "distributed prompt-aware scheduling" to handle the diverse resource consumption of different prompts and maximize prompt locality across instances.

Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrate streaming provides up to 3x higher throughput and 1.8x lower tail latency on a pipeline.
- Identify and analyze novel challenges with streaming - correctness for stateful aggregation, and load balancing across diverse prompts. 
- Propose aggregation-aware routing interface in ALTO system to address correctness.
- Motivate need for and provide ideas on distributed prompt-aware scheduling to optimize load balancing.

In summary, the paper makes a case for streaming architectures for compound AI systems using partial outputs from language models, while highlighting and providing initial solutions for new correctness and load balancing problems that emerge as a result.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents ALTO, a system that orchestrates streaming compound AI pipelines built around generative language models by allowing developers to specify aggregation constraints for correct routing while also providing automatic load balancing across pipeline stages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of ALTO, a network orchestrator system for efficiently serving compound AI systems built around pipelines of generative language models. Specifically:

- The key observation is that streaming intermediate outputs between distributed pipeline stages can reduce end-to-end latency and increase throughput for compound AI systems. 

- The paper highlights two key challenges that emerge when trying to stream intermediate outputs: correctness when some stages aggregate data, and efficient load balancing across prompts that can have varying computational requirements. 

- The paper proposes aggregation-aware routing, an interface to express aggregation constraints so partial outputs can be correctly routed to stateful stages. It also motivates the need for distributed prompt-aware scheduling to address the load balancing challenge.

- The paper evaluates a prototype ALTO implementation on a pipeline inspired by FacTool, a fact checking system. The results demonstrate significant improvements in throughput and tail latency compared to a baseline non-streaming approach.

In summary, the main contribution is the analysis, design, and evaluation of the ALTO system for orchestrating streaming compound AI pipelines in a way that ensures correctness while optimizing performance. The key ideas of aggregation-aware routing and distributed prompt-aware scheduling are highlighted as important directions for future work.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- ALTO (Automatic Language Token Orchestrator) - The proposed system for efficiently serving compound AI pipelines built around generative language models by streaming intermediate outputs.

- Compound AI systems - Complex AI systems composed of multiple components chained together, such as pipelines of language models.

- Generative language models (LMs) - Models that can generate text output token-by-token in an incremental, autoregressive fashion.

- Partial output streaming - The core technique in ALTO of streaming intermediate outputs between pipeline stages instead of waiting for complete outputs. This reduces latency and increases throughput.

- Aggregation-aware routing - An interface in ALTO to specify where partial outputs need to be routed to ensure correct aggregation for stateful pipeline stages.

- Distributed prompt-aware scheduling - A proposed load balancing technique to maximize throughput across prompts with diverse resource requirements.

- Throughput, latency - Performance metrics that partial output streaming aims to optimize.

- Correctness, load balancing - Key challenges that emerge when streaming across distributed pipeline stages.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed system (ALTO), the application area (compound AI systems), the core techniques (partial output streaming), the routing mechanisms (aggregation-aware routing), performance goals (throughput, latency), and the main challenges (correctness, load balancing).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes aggregation-aware routing to address the correctness challenge when streaming partial outputs between pipeline stages. Can you expand on why existing streaming interfaces are insufficient to specify the complex aggregation logic required here? What are some examples of aggregation operators that would be useful to include in a general library for specifying aggregation logic?

2. The paper argues that distributed prompt-aware scheduling is necessary to efficiently load balance requests across language model instances. What are some ways prompt statistics like output data size and latency could be measured accurately given challenges like internal scheduling in serving engines? How might an optimization problem be formulated to balance prompt locality and flexible load balancing?

3. Streaming partial outputs seems most applicable to pipelines with autoregressive language models. What opportunities might exist to apply similar ideas to other components like retrievers or classifiers? Would the scheduling and routing challenges differ in these alternate settings?

4. The evaluation focuses on a pipeline inspired by FacTool. How do you think performance would change for other complex compound AI systems like chatbots or question answering systems? Would the relative throughput/latency improvements from streaming be greater or smaller?

5. The paper proposes integrating language model serving systems like vLLM as high-throughput LM executors. What practical challenges might come up when trying to integrate such engines? Would it limit flexibility in prompt-aware scheduling or routing policies?  

6. What other types of constraints beyond aggregation might need to be considered when routing partial outputs? For example, are there privacy or security implications to how data flows between certain pipeline stages?

7. The paper argues that streaming provides throughput and latency benefits over non-streaming approaches. What overhead is introduced by the asynchronous queues and centralized routing logic proposed? How might this overhead tradeoff with optimization benefits at different scales or loads?

8. What types of compound AI systems might not benefit as much from streaming optimizations proposed in this paper? For example, would purely extractive pipelines see similar gains?

9. The scheduling policy hashes constraints to pick a destination. Could more advanced policies like weighted round robin or join-shortest-queue perform better? What challenges might come up when implementing them?

10. Beyond FACTOOL, what are some other promising practical applications which could directly build on top of ALTO's capabilities today with minimal modification? What components would need to be built out further to serve a broader range of compound AI systems?
