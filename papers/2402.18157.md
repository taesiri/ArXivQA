# [From Summary to Action: Enhancing Large Language Models for Complex   Tasks with Open World APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18157)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in comprehending human language. However, their capabilities are limited when tackling complex real-world tasks that require using specialized tools. 
- Prior works have tried augmenting LLMs with tools using two main approaches: 1) dataset construction and model fine-tuning, 2) in-context learning. But these have limitations in handling complicated tasks and diverse tools.
- Existing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) and ReAct can propagate errors. Tree-based reasoning methods like Depth First Search Decision Tree (DFSDT) may repeat actions and ignore valuable information from past branches.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Sum2Act, a novel framework with two key components:
   1) Router: Decides the next action based on current state, instruction and tools.
   2) State Manager: Summarizes observations from tool executions and updates the state.
- The router plans actions iteratively. If it decides the task is completed, it provides the final response. 
- The state manager maintains a summarized representation of current results and failure history. This helps keep context concise while minimizing information loss.
- Sum2Act incorporates a reflection capability to identify and rectify errors.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes router and state manager framework that equips LLMs to explicitly monitor progress and correct mistakes. 
- Integrates over 16,000 real-world APIs and additional visual APIs.
- Outperforms existing methods like CoT, ReAct and DFSDT on the ToolBench benchmark.
- Showcases adept handling of diverse vision tasks by seamlessly combining open-world and visual APIs.

In summary, the paper presents Sum2Act, a novel and effective reasoning framework to enhance LLMs' capability in addressing complex real-world tasks using massive tools and APIs.
