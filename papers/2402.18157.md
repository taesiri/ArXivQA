# [From Summary to Action: Enhancing Large Language Models for Complex   Tasks with Open World APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18157)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in comprehending human language. However, their capabilities are limited when tackling complex real-world tasks that require using specialized tools. 
- Prior works have tried augmenting LLMs with tools using two main approaches: 1) dataset construction and model fine-tuning, 2) in-context learning. But these have limitations in handling complicated tasks and diverse tools.
- Existing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) and ReAct can propagate errors. Tree-based reasoning methods like Depth First Search Decision Tree (DFSDT) may repeat actions and ignore valuable information from past branches.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Sum2Act, a novel framework with two key components:
   1) Router: Decides the next action based on current state, instruction and tools.
   2) State Manager: Summarizes observations from tool executions and updates the state.
- The router plans actions iteratively. If it decides the task is completed, it provides the final response. 
- The state manager maintains a summarized representation of current results and failure history. This helps keep context concise while minimizing information loss.
- Sum2Act incorporates a reflection capability to identify and rectify errors.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes router and state manager framework that equips LLMs to explicitly monitor progress and correct mistakes. 
- Integrates over 16,000 real-world APIs and additional visual APIs.
- Outperforms existing methods like CoT, ReAct and DFSDT on the ToolBench benchmark.
- Showcases adept handling of diverse vision tasks by seamlessly combining open-world and visual APIs.

In summary, the paper presents Sum2Act, a novel and effective reasoning framework to enhance LLMs' capability in addressing complex real-world tasks using massive tools and APIs.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces a novel tool invocation framework comprising a router and a state manager. This framework equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capability to explicitly monitor task progress and rectify errors.

2. Comparative experiments on ToolBench reveal that the proposed framework outperforms existing baselines like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Depth First Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in addressing complicated real-world tasks. 

3. Visual APIs are additionally incorporated with open-world APIs in ToolBench, showing the ability of the proposed Sum2Act framework to handle more diverse vision tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is a new reasoning framework called Sum2Act that enhances the reasoning and tool use capabilities of large language models to solve complex real-world tasks involving both text and visual data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called "Sum2Act" for enhancing large language models to solve complex real-world tasks using APIs. Can you explain in detail the key components of this framework and how they work together? 

2. One of the main ideas in Sum2Act is the "summarization" step after taking each action. Why is this summarization important? How does it help guide the model's reasoning and avoid common issues like error propagation?

3. The Sum2Act framework incorporates both a "router" and a "state manager". What are the specific roles and responsibilities of each? How do they interact within the overall pipeline?

4. The paper argues that Sum2Act combines strengths of both chain-based and tree-based reasoning methods. Can you analyze this claim and explain how Sum2Act balances qualities of both approaches? 

5. What specifically does the "state" represent in Sum2Act and how is it updated after each action? How does this differ from a traditional memory structure?

6. One experiment in the paper explores adding a module for task decomposition. What were the results of this experiment? Why might accurate task decomposition still be an open challenge?  

7. How does the prompting structure and content provided to the router and state manager components guide the model's behavior? Can you analyze the prompts in more detail?

8. The ToolBench benchmark contains over 16,000 real-world APIs. How does this dynamic and extensive API access enable more complex and unbounded reasoning? 

9. What additional capabilities were gained by incorporating visual APIs into the ToolBench benchmark? How does this showcase Sum2Act's versatility?

10. Can you discuss limitations of Sum2Act and challenges that still remain open for future work in this direction of tool-based reasoning for language models?
