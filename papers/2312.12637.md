# [Domain-Independent Disperse and Pick method for Robotic Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12637)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robotic grasping of novel objects in cluttered environments is challenging due to difficulties in segmenting objects and singulating the target object from clutter. This leads to grasp failures or picking multiple objects. 
- Existing solutions using deep learning require large amounts of training data and simulation-to-real transfer is difficult. Analytical methods can fail due to clutter obstructing the gripper.

Proposed Solution:
- A framework called "Disperse and Pick" that incorporates clutter removal to assist grasping of novel objects in cluttered environments without needing object models or training data.  
- It has 3 main components:
   1) Clutter Estimation: Uses a feature congestion model to generate a pixel-wise clutter map of the scene and estimate global & local clutter scores.
   2) Action Selection: Decides between grasp and a push-to-move "disperse" action based on clutter scores to reduce clutter at grasp locations.
   3) Improved Grasp Planning: An enhanced analytic grasping method using optimized grasp scoring and adaptive estimation of number of objects for unsupervised pose clustering.

Main Contributions:
- A domain-independent clutter removal approach using heuristic push actions that does not need deep learning and works on novel objects
- An improved analytic grasping algorithm incorporating clutter awareness and adaptivity  
- Integrated system combining clutter removal and grasping showing significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real-world experiments. 

The key novelty is the introduction of model-free clutter manipulation to aid analytic grasping of novel objects in cluttered scenes. By dispersing clutter when needed, the integrated system can grasp effectively without collisions or multi-picks.
