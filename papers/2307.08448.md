# [Not All Steps are Created Equal: Selective Diffusion Distillation for   Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we leverage diffusion models for fast and high-quality image manipulation while avoiding their inherent trade-off between editability and fidelity? 

The key hypothesis seems to be: By training a separate feedforward image manipulation network under the guidance of a pretrained diffusion model, it may be possible to distill the generation capabilities of diffusion models into an efficient model that can manipulate images with only a single forward pass, avoiding the slow iterative process required by diffusion models.

Specifically, the paper proposes training the image manipulation network by passing manipulated images through the diffusion model and using its training loss and generated gradients as supervision signal. Additionally, it introduces a method to select semantically relevant timesteps in the diffusion process to provide more useful supervision. 

The paper shows experimentally that this approach can manipulate images while retaining fidelity more effectively than directly using diffusion models or other baselines. It also demonstrates significantly faster manipulation than iterative diffusion-based approaches.

In summary, the main research thrust is using diffusion model knowledge distillation and selective timestep guidance to create an efficient high-quality image manipulation model, circumventing tradeoffs faced by diffusion models directly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a new framework called Selective Diffusion Distillation (SDD) for image manipulation that ensures both fidelity and editability of images. 

2. Training a feedforward image manipulation network under the guidance of a diffusion model, avoiding the dilemma caused by the diffusion process directly manipulating images.

3. Proposing an effective indicator called the hybrid quality score (HQS) to select semantic-related timesteps to obtain correct semantic guidance from the diffusion model.

4. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that the proposed SDD framework avoids the editability-fidelity tradeoff in diffusion-based image manipulation while achieving higher efficiency.

In summary, the key ideas seem to be using a diffusion model to supervise training an efficient feedforward image manipulator network, and selecting appropriate timesteps using the proposed HQS to provide correct semantic guidance during training. This avoids tradeoffs faced by directly manipulating images with a diffusion model, while achieving effective and efficient image manipulation as demonstrated experimentally.
