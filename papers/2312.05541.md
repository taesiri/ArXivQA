- DPoser is designed for flexibility and integration into various pose-related tasks like human mesh recovery, pose completion and motion denoising. 
- These tasks are formulated as inverse problems, and variational diffusion sampling techniques are employed to incorporate DPoser as a regularization term.
- A novel truncated timestep scheduling strategy is introduced during test-time optimization to boost efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of DPoser, a diffusion model based framework to craft a robust human pose prior for integration into diverse applications.
