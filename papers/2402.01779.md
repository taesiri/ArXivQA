# [Plug-and-Play image restoration with Stochastic deNOising REgularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01779)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image restoration tasks like deblurring and inpainting are ill-posed inverse problems. They are commonly formulated as optimization problems with a data fidelity term and a regularization term.
- Choosing good regularization terms is challenging. Recently, plug-and-play (PnP) methods that use pre-trained deep denoisers as regularization have shown promising results. 
- However, in PnP methods the denoiser is applied on images that get less and less noisy over iterations, which causes a distribution shift from training data. Recent diffusion model-based methods apply denoisers only on noisy inputs but lack theoretical convergence guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new regularization called Stochastic deNOising Regularization (SNORE) where the denoiser is applied on a noisy version of the image at each iteration.
- SNORE is based on an explicit regularization that measures if noisy versions of an image look like samples from the noisy image prior. Its gradient applies the denoiser on noisy inputs.
- This leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for image restoration that provably converges to critical points of the optimization problem. An annealed version is also motivated.

Main Contributions:  
- A new regularization for PnP image restoration where the denoiser sees noisy images, avoiding distribution shift issues.
- Theoretical analysis providing convergence guarantees for the proposed stochastic optimization algorithm.
- Competitive or better quantitative and qualitative performance compared to state-of-the-art PnP and diffusion methods on image deblurring and inpainting.
- Bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees of PnP methods and practical performance of diffusion model-based approaches.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled way to apply denoisers only on noisy images in PnP image restoration, with convergence guarantees, leading to results that are comparable or better than the state-of-the-art.
