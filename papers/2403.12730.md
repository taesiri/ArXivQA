# [What Does Evaluation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence Actually   Tell Us? A Case for Compositional and Contextual Validation of XAI Building   Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) systems remains challenging due to their sociotechnical nature - they involve both technical algorithmic components and social aspects related to human users. 
- Existing evaluation approaches have limitations:
    - Inconsistent or contradictory evaluation findings, especially from user studies
    - Neglect of context and specific use cases 
    - Oversimplification of the human explanatory process as a one-way communication
    - Treatment of XAI systems as monolithic rather than modular
    - Overlooking the effect of model quality on explanation effectiveness

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a utility-based evaluation framework that recognizes the sociotechnical gap spanned by XAI systems
- Identify functionally independent technical, social and sociotechnical components of XAI systems 
- Evaluate these components at multiple levels (individually, in modules, end-to-end) using appropriate computational, user-based or mixed validation 
- Explicitly account for intended operational context to determine suitable evaluation criteria and ensure validity

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of limitations of existing XAI evaluation approaches
- Identification of key deficiencies: inconsistency, context neglect, human process oversimplification, monolithic misconstruing, model quality effects
- Proposal of a flexible, modular evaluation framework tailored to sociotechnical XAI systems 
- Guidelines for multi-level component evaluation accounting for technical correctness, social effectiveness and operational context
- Potential to streamline validation and enable repositories of validated XAI building blocks

The summary covers the problem context, highlights limitations of current methods, explains the proposed modular evaluation framework, and describes its main advantages in validating sociotechnical XAI systems in context.
