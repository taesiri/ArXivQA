# [LoRETTA: Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation for   Ultra-Low-Parameter Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like BERT and LLaMA on downstream tasks requires updating all model parameters, which is computationally expensive. 
- Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters and LoRA still have too many trainable parameters for large models. For example, LoRA needs to update over 16 million parameters for LLaMA-2-70B.
- There is a need for an ultra parameter-efficient method with minimal trainable parameters yet maintains performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose LoRETTA, a framework with two variants - LoRETTA_adp and LoRETTA_rep for efficient LLM fine-tuning.
- LoRETTA employs tensor train (TT) decomposition to compress large weight matrices into small TT factors. Only these factors are updated during fine-tuning.
- LoRETTA_adp uses lightweight tensorized adapters with TT layers inserted into self-attention blocks. 
- LoRETTA_rep reparameterizes weight matrices as the product of TT factors and updates these TT factors.

Main Contributions:
- LoRETTA achieves comparable or better performance than widely used PEFT methods on LLaMA-2 with up to 100x fewer trainable parameters. 
- LoRETTA_adp outperforms all existing PEFT methods given the same number of parameters.
- LoRETTA requires substantially lower memory for parameter storage and training. LoRETTA_rep uses less than 1MB storage.
- LoRETTA shows better multi-task learning ability and handles overfitting more effectively.
- Code is provided for easy adoption of LoRETTA. Experiments cover diverse tasks and models including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa and LLaMA.

In summary, LoRETTA enables highly efficient LLM fine-tuning with ultra-low trainable parameters yet maintains performance across models and tasks. The tensor train formulation proves to be a compact and effective way to update large model weights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LoRETTA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large language models that uses tensor-train decomposition to achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning and other methods but with up to 100x fewer trainable parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes LoRETTA, an ultra-parameter-efficient framework that significantly reduces trainable parameters through tensor-train decomposition for fine-tuning large language models. Specifically, it proposes two methods - LoRETTA_{adp} using tensorized adapters, and LoRETTA_{rep} using weight parameterization with tensor factors.

2) LoRETTA achieves comparable or better performance than most widely used PEFT methods with up to 100x fewer parameters on the LLaMA-2-7B models. Empirical results demonstrate it effectively improves training efficiency, enjoys better multi-task learning performance, and enhances anti-overfitting capability.

3) Comprehensive studies are conducted against other PEFT methods regarding storage/computation efficiency, anti-overfitting ability, forgetting risks for multi-task learning, and performance under different setups.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LoRETTA framework that enables ultra-parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models with improved efficiency, effectiveness, and versatility compared to prior PEFT methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- LoRETTA (Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation): The proposed framework for ultra-parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models using tensor train decomposition. Includes two variants - LoRETTA_{adp} and LoRETTA_{rep}.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT): Methods for adapting large pre-trained models using only a small subset of trainable parameters rather than fine-tuning the whole model. Help address computational costs.  

- Tensor train (TT) decomposition: Method for compressing high-dimensional tensors into a series of smaller core tensors connected along modes. Used to represent weight matrices in LoRETTA with low storage.

- Adapters: Small trainable modules injected into model to leave most parameters frozen. LoRETTA uses lightweight "tensorized adapters".

- Reparameterization: Updating existing weight matrices with low-rank structures. LoRETTA_{rep} updates weights with tensorized layers.  

- Large language models (LLMs): Models like BERT and GPT-3 with huge parameter counts, requiring efficient fine-tuning methods.

- Multi-task learning: Training model on multiple tasks/datasets. LoRETTA shows good anti-forgetting abilities here.

- Overfitting: Models losing generalization capability by over-learning patterns in training data. LoRETTA mitigates this issue.
