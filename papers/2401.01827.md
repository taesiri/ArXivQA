# [Moonshot: Towards Controllable Video Generation and Editing with   Multimodal Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video diffusion models rely solely on text prompts for conditional control. This lacks precision in describing desired visual appearance and geometry of generated videos.
- Inserting temporal modules in spatial UNet hinders integration of image control networks like ControlNet.
- Absence of visual conditioning overburdens temporal modules in ensuring both temporal consistency and spatial quality. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces Multimodal Video Block (MVB) architecture with spatial-temporal UNet layers and decoupled multimodal cross attention.
- Spatial-temporal UNet preserves spatial features allowing reuse of pre-trained image ControlNets.
- Decoupled multimodal cross attention conditions simultaneously on text and images, enhancing visual cues.
- Facilitates tasks like personalized video generation, image animation and video editing.

Key Contributions:
- Multimodal Video Block with spatial-temporal UNet and decoupled cross attention for precision control.
- Immediate reuse of image ControlNet modules without added training. 
- Versatile conditioning mechanisms for personalized video generation.
- State-of-the-art performance on image animation and video editing tasks.
- Potential to serve as a fundamental architecture for controllable video generation.

In summary, the paper introduces an architecture that combines spatial-temporal modeling capacity with multimodal conditioning to achieve precision control over generated video appearance and layout. The flexibility of the approach is validated through strong results on diverse video generation tasks.
