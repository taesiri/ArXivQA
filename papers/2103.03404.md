# [Attention is Not All You Need: Pure Attention Loses Rank Doubly   Exponentially with Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03404)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that pure self-attention networks (transformers without skip connections or MLPs) suffer from a rapid "rank collapse" where the output converges doubly exponentially to a rank-1 matrix, making all tokens identical. 

The key research questions addressed are:

1) Why does rank collapse occur in pure self-attention networks?

2) What architectural components of the transformer (skip connections, MLPs) counteract this rank collapse?

3) How can we analyze and understand this phenomenon theoretically?

Specifically, the authors introduce a "path decomposition" framework to analyze transformers as ensembles of paths, where each path is a sequence of attention heads. Using this, they show theoretically that each path rapidly loses rank, leading to rank collapse. They further analyze how skip connections and MLPs mitigate this. Overall, the goal is to understand the inductive biases of transformers and the roles of different components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proving that pure multi-head self-attention networks, without skip connections or MLPs, lose rank doubly exponentially with depth. Specifically, the paper shows that the output of such networks converges to a rank 1 matrix that makes all tokens identical. 

The key findings are:

- Using a "path decomposition", the paper shows that a multi-head self-attention network can be decomposed into a sum of simpler single-head networks, referred to as "paths". 

- Analyzing these paths, the paper proves that each path's output converges cubically to a rank 1 matrix. Since there are exponentially more paths as the network depth increases, the overall network's output also collapses to rank 1.

- This indicates a strong inductive bias in pure self-attention towards "token uniformity".

- Adding skip connections and MLPs to the self-attention network are shown to counteract this rank collapse. Skip connections do so by enabling short paths that do not lose rank, while MLPs slow down the convergence by increasing the Lipschitz constant.

- Experiments verify the theoretical results, showing rank collapse in pure self-attention networks and its mitigation when skip connections and MLPs are introduced.

In summary, the paper provides new theoretical insights into self-attention networks and reveals the opposing effects of different transformer components in contributing to or preventing rank collapse. The path decomposition is also a useful new tool for analyzing transformers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper shows that pure self-attention networks, without skip connections or MLPs, lose expressive power doubly exponentially as they get deeper, converging to a rank-1 matrix with identical rows, but skip connections and MLPs counteract this by increasing rank and preventing token uniformity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on understanding and analyzing attention mechanisms:

- Focus on rank collapse of output: This paper provides novel theoretical analysis showing that multi-head self-attention layers cause the output to converge to rank 1 (i.e. rank collapse) exponentially quickly without skip connections or MLPs. Prior work has studied properties like the rank of individual attention matrices, but this is the first to analyze conditions for rank collapse of the full network output.

- Path decomposition method: The paper introduces a new way to analyze transformers by decomposing them into sums over "paths" corresponding to sequences of attention heads. This modularizes the analysis and provides a view of transformers as ensembles of interdependent shallow networks. This path view seems unique to this paper. 

- Analysis of different architectural components: The paper systematically studies how different transformer components (self-attention, skip connections, MLPs, etc.) contribute to or prevent rank collapse. This sheds new light on the roles of these components, especially revealing skip connections are vital to stop rank collapse. 

- Connections to model efficiency: The rank collapse analysis provides a new perspective on model efficiency. The paper suggests models overly reliant on long paths may be less efficient and robust. This aligns with recent findings showing huge overparameterization in models like GPT-3.

- Focus on theory: Much prior work has analyzed transformers empirically or proposed new architectures. This paper's focus on theoretical analysis of core transformer components provides complimentary insights. The theoretical results align well with experiments.

In summary, this paper provides novel theoretical perspectives on transformers, especially concerning rank collapse and path decompositions, while also connecting these insights to practical issues like model efficiency and the roles of different components. The analysis stands out from prior work and adds important new understanding of transformer architectures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions based on their findings:

1. How can we leverage the token-uniformity inductive bias revealed in this work to design more effective networks, perhaps better at utilizing long paths? The authors indicate there is currently underutilized capacity in long paths, and preventing their rank collapse could make transformers more effective.

2. What are the practical implications for the width-depth trade-off in transformer design? The results reveal a tug-of-war between self-attention convergence and MLP counteracting forces that likely has architectural design implications. 

3. Can we prove meaningful lower bounds on residual convergence for transformers? The authors were able to show upper bounds on convergence, but providing lower bounds is noted as an open challenge.

4. Can the insights from the path decomposition be used to build more efficient models? The authors suggest models with more diverse path distributions may be more parameter efficient, but leave detailed exploration for future work.

5. How do the findings connect to ongoing work on efficient transformer variants (Xformers)? The analysis provides a new lens to understand tradeoffs in many recently proposed approximations to self-attention.

Overall, the authors put forth a range of interesting research questions to further understand and improve transformers based on the new theoretical insights provided in the paper. Key directions involve better utilizing model capacity, translating findings to architectural design, and connecting ideas to other active areas like efficient transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper investigates the properties and inductive biases of self-attention networks (SANs), which form the basis of transformer networks. The key findings are:

- SANs can be decomposed into a sum of "paths", where each path consists of a sequence of attention heads across layers. This provides a new way to analyze SANs as consisting of many weakly dependent shallow networks. 

- Without skip connections or MLPs, SANs converge doubly exponentially fast to a rank-1 matrix with identical rows ("token uniformity"). This implies a strong inductive bias in pure SANs towards reducing token diversity.

- Skip connections are crucial to stop rank collapse, revealing a vital role beyond just gradient flow. MLPs also help slow down rank collapse. 

- Experiments confirm the theory and show that short paths (<3 layers) account for most of the expressive power of SANs. This supports viewing SANs as ensembles of shallow networks.

The key insight is that skip connections and MLPs act as vital counterforces to the strong bias of SANs towards token uniformity and rank collapse. This provides a new understanding of the role of different components in making transformers effective.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies self-attention networks, specifically transformers, and aims to understand their effectiveness and limitations. The authors show that pure self-attention networks, without skip connections or MLPs, converge doubly exponentially to a rank-1 matrix with identical rows as the depth increases. This indicates a strong inductive bias towards "token uniformity". Through a novel "path decomposition", the paper decomposes self-attention networks into independent paths of different lengths, with each path passing through one head per layer. Using this decomposition, they prove the rapid rank collapse for pure self-attention nets. 

The paper then studies how different components of the transformer architecture counteract this rank collapse. Skip connections are shown to be crucial, as they allow many short paths which preserve rank. MLPs placed after attention also help by increasing representational power through their nonlinearity. Experiments verify the theory, showing rank collapse occurs in standard architectures when skip connections are removed. Overall, this work provides new theoretical insights into self-attention networks, revealing the competing forces of attention vs. skip connections/MLPs that shape the transformer's inductive biases. The path decomposition is a novel tool for understanding and designing attention architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes analyzing self-attention networks through a "path decomposition" that expresses the network output as a sum of terms, where each term corresponds to the operation of a sequence of attention heads across layers (referred to as a "path"). Specifically, a depth L self-attention network with H heads per layer can be decomposed into H^L paths, each corresponding to a particular sequence of head choices across the L layers. The paper then analyzes how the residual (the difference between the output and a rank 1 approximation) evolves when propagating an input through the network, both for individual paths and for the full network. This analysis reveals that without skip connections or MLPs, the output of both individual paths and the overall network converges doubly exponentially to a rank 1 matrix, indicating an inductive bias towards "token uniformity". The paper further studies how architectural modifications like skip connections and MLPs counteract this convergence.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the phenomenon of rank collapse in self-attention networks/transformers. More specifically:

- The paper shows that pure self-attention networks (without skip connections or MLPs) converge doubly exponentially to a rank-1 matrix that makes all tokens identical. This indicates a strong inductive bias towards "token uniformity". 

- The paper aims to understand why transformers work well in practice despite this apparent tendency of attention to lose rank. It identifies skip connections and MLPs as two key components that counteract the rank collapse phenomenon in transformers.

- More broadly, the paper provides new insights into the inner workings and architectural design of transformers by studying how different components (self-attention, skip connections, MLPs) impact the rank and expressivity.

In summary, the key questions addressed are:

1) Why does pure self-attention rapidly lose rank/expressivity with depth? 

2) How do skip connections and MLPs counteract this rank collapse?

3) What does this reveal about the overall inductive biases and architectural design of transformers?

By studying the rank dynamics, the paper provides both a theoretical understanding of self-attention as well as practical insights into transformer design.

 The paper studies the inductive biases and rank properties of self-attention networks (SANs). The key findings are:

- SANs without skip connections or MLPs converge doubly exponentially to a rank-1 matrix with identical rows as the depth increases. This shows SANs have a strong bias towards "token uniformity". 

- Skip connections play a crucial role in stopping the rank collapse by introducing short paths and diversifying the path distribution. This reveals a previously unknown vital utility of skip connections beyond just facilitating optimization.

- MLPs inserted after attention also help counteract the rank collapse, but do so by increasing the Lipschitz constant which can hurt robustness. 

- The output of a SAN can be decomposed into a sum of "paths", each path corresponding to a sequence of single heads across layers. This view reveals SANs behave like ensembles of shallow networks, with short paths contributing most of the expressivity.

- Experiments on transformer variants validate the theory, showing rapid rank collapse when skip connections are removed, and deteriorating path effectiveness as path length increases.

Overall, the work provides new theoretical understanding about the oppositions and synergies between different transformer components, revealing self-attention's bias towards token uniformity which gets balanced by other elements like skip connections. The path perspective also offers new ways to analyze and improve SANs.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the rank collapse phenomenon in self-attention networks (SANs). The authors show that pure SANs without skip connections or MLPs lose expressive power doubly exponentially as network depth increases, converging to a rank-1 matrix that makes all tokens identical. They derive this result through a novel "path decomposition" of SANs into simpler single-head paths and prove bounds on the residual matrix norm after each path. Adding skip connections and MLPs counteracts the rank collapse by creating shorter paths and increasing nonlinearity. Experiments on transformer variants confirm the theory - pure self-attention suffers rank collapse, while transformers are robust due to skip connections. The path decomposition also provides a new view of transformers as ensembles of shallow networks. Overall, the paper reveals the opposing effects of self-attention vs skip connections and MLPs on rank, explaining why transformers work despite the degeneration of pure self-attention.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper shows that pure self-attention networks lose expressive power doubly exponentially with depth due to rank collapse. However, what exactly causes this rapid rank collapse as the network gets deeper? Is it fundamentally an issue with the attention mechanism itself or the way it is applied in transformers?

2. The path decomposition method provides an interesting way to analyze self-attention networks. However, are there any limitations to this approach? For example, does it overlook certain interactions between paths that may affect the convergence behavior? 

3. The paper identifies the opposing effects of self-attention versus skip connections and MLPs on rank collapse. Have there been any attempts to more explicitly balance or control these effects, rather than having them compete? Could this lead to better-behaved self-attention networks?

4. How sensitive are the convergence results to different architectures and hyperparameters? For example, do wider self-attention networks exhibit slower rank collapse? Or do different attention mechanisms like gaussian attention behave differently?

5. The paper shows skip connections are vital to prevent rank collapse, but are there other architectural modifications that could have a similar effect? For instance, could sparsity patterns in attention retard convergence?

6. The path effectiveness experiments provide evidence that transformers rely on short paths. But what causes longer paths to lose expressiveness - is it an optimization issue or more fundamental? 

7. Are the identified convergence phenomena unique to self-attention, or do other sequence models like RNNs exhibit similar behavior? Are there parallels in other domains like computer vision?

8. How do the theoretical results translate into differences in model performance and efficiency? Are there clear gains from preventing rapid rank collapse?

9. The paper focuses on rank collapse in self-attention. But are there other problematic inductive biases that could be studied? For example, biases related to depth, width, or attention patterns. 

10. The path ensemble view provides a new perspective on transformers. How could we leverage this understanding - for example by explicitly training or regularizing individual paths? Are there other theoretical insights enabled by this view?
