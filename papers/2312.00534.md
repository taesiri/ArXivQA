# [LiDAR-based curb detection for ground truth annotation in automated   driving validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00534)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a methodology to provide 3D curb pre-annotations from LiDAR point clouds for use in annotation tools to reduce manual annotation time. The method has two steps: a deep neural network to detect curbs scan-wise in bird's eye view representations, and a refinement process to generate 3D curb polylines sequence-wise. Experiments show the DNN achieves 90.7% precision at detecting curbs. The complete pipeline is validated through a curb annotation campaign with 4 annotators. Results show that the annotation time is reduced by 50.99% using the automatically generated pre-annotations versus annotating from scratch, while maintaining data quality within a 2.647% average F-score difference. The demonstrated ability to significantly decrease annotation time highlights the potential of the proposed methodology to efficiently generate high-quality ground truth curb data at scale to facilitate development and validation of automated driving systems.
