# [On the rates of convergence for learning with convolutional neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the approximation and learning capacities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, it aims to derive convergence rates for estimators based on CNNs in nonparametric regression and classification that are minimax optimal. 

Proposed Solution:
1) Provides new bounds for approximating smooth functions with CNNs that have explicit control on the network weights. Shows the approximation rate of $O(L^{-\alpha/d})$ for functions with smoothness $\alpha$ and CNN depth $L$. 

2) Gives improved analysis of the covering number (complexity measure) for feedforward neural networks including CNNs. The bound is $O(L \log(LM/\epsilon))$ when the weights have constraint level $M$. This is better than general bounds when $M$ grows slowly with $L$.

3) Applies the approximation and covering number bounds to analyze least squares regression and binary classification with CNNs. Carefully balances approximation vs estimation error and network complexity to attain optimal convergence rates.

Key Contributions:

- Establishes minimax optimal rates for nonparametric regression with CNNs based least squares under smoothness assumptions. Closes gap compared to previous suboptimal analyses.

- For binary classification, proves excess risk convergence rates for CNN classifiers that are optimal under Tsybakov noise and smoothness conditions. First such result for CNNs. 

- Provides a framework for estimating sample complexity of learning with feedforward neural networks based on weight constraints. May find wider applications.

Overall, the paper significantly advances theoretical understanding of CNNs by providing optimal learning guarantees in important statistical settings. The analysis techniques can enable further progress.
