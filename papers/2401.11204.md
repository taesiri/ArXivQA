# [Towards Category Unification of 3D Single Object Tracking on Point   Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing 3D single object tracking (SOT) methods are category-specific, requiring separate models to track different object categories like cars, pedestrians, etc. This leads to limited generalization capability and redundant parameters. The paper explores the possibility of developing a unified model that can track all object categories using a single network. 

However, directly training a model on cross-category data results in suboptimal performance due to varying size, shape and motion attributes across categories. Specifically, existing networks have fixed receptive fields unable to capture varying geometric details. Search regions have inconsistent foreground-background ratios for different categories. And output distributions are very different due to distinct sizes and shapes.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two category-unified models - SiamCUT and MoCUT that can track all categories using a single siamese network and single motion network respectively. 

The key ideas are:
1) A new point set network called AdaFormer that uses deformable groups and vector attention to encode geometric details of different categories uniformly.

2) Unified model inputs generated using template target's size to maintain consistent foreground/background ratios across categories.  

3) Unified learning objective that transforms output offsets to consistent scale and uses shape-aware labels to balance positive/negative samples across categories.

Contributions:
1) First work to unify 3D SOT across all categories with a single network.

2) Novel AdaFormer network to encode cross-category geometric details uniformly.

3) Unified model inputs and objective for stable training.

Results:
Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets show SiamCUT and MoCUT achieve excellent performance and outperform category-specific state-of-the-arts. They also generalize well to unseen datasets like Waymo. The unified modeling provides consistent improvements over specializing models individually per category.

In summary, the paper makes category-unified 3D tracking possible with improved performance over category-specific methods, demonstrating the generalization capability of unified models to track arbitrary objects.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes category-unified 3D single object tracking models, SiamCUT and MoCUT, which can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a single network with shared parameters, achieving better performance than category-specific counterparts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two category-unified models, SiamCUT and MoCUT, for 3D single object tracking (SOT). These models can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a single network with shared parameters, instead of requiring separate category-specific models. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing the first category-unified models for 3D SOT based on Siamese and motion-centric paradigms. This unifies tracking across object categories.

2) Designing a novel point set network called AdaFormer that can encode shape and size information from different object categories in a unified manner. This enables the models to adapt to cross-category data.

3) Introducing unified model inputs and learning objectives to facilitate learning a unified representation, enhancing generalization and stability.

4) Comprehensive experiments showing SiamCUT and MoCUT achieve strong performance and outperform category-specific counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified models.

In summary, the main contribution is enabling 3D SOT across categories with unified models SiamCUT and MoCUT, through innovations like the AdaFormer network and unified model inputs/objectives. This is the first work aiming to unify tracking across object categories.
