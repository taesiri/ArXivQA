# [HOTR: End-to-End Human-Object Interaction Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13682)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes HOTR, a novel transformer-based framework for human-object interaction (HOI) detection that directly predicts a set of human-object-interaction triplets from an image. HOTR features an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel instance and interaction decoders that share an encoder. The interaction decoder predicts "HO Pointers" that associate each interaction representation with corresponding human and object detections from the instance decoder. This allows exploiting relationships between detections while avoiding redundant localization predictions. A recomposition step then assembles the final HOI triplets from the outputs of the two decoders. Compared to prior HOI methods, HOTR eliminates the need for post-processing like NMS or heuristic matching between detected instances and interactions. It is end-to-end trainable with a loss based on optimal bipartite matching and Hungarian matching. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on the V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks, with inference under 1ms. Ablations validate the benefits of the proposed HO Pointers, a shared encoder, and interactiveness suppression. Overall, HOTR advances HOI detection through an effective set prediction formulation within a transformer framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes HOTR, a transformer-based framework for human-object interaction detection that directly predicts interaction triplets in a scene using parallel decoders and pointer networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while being significantly faster than prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes HOTR, the first transformer-based set prediction approach for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. HOTR eliminates the need for hand-crafted post-processing stages required by previous HOI detectors, while being able to model correlations between interactions.

2. It proposes various training and inference techniques for HOTR: HO Pointers to associate the outputs of two parallel decoders, a recomposition step to predict a set of final HOI triplets, and a new loss function to enable end-to-end training. 

3. HOTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark HOI detection datasets (V-COCO and HICO-DET), while having significantly faster inference time compared to previous parallel HOI detectors (under 1ms vs 5-9ms).

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first transformer-based set prediction model for HOI detection, along with associated training and inference techniques, that achieves top performance while being much faster than prior art.

The paper proposes a new transformer-based framework called HOTR for HOI detection. It formulates HOI detection as a set prediction problem and uses an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoders. Key components include the HO Pointers to associate human and object boxes, a recomposition step to predict the final HOI triplets, interactiveness suppression to remove redundant predictions, and end-to-end training. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks with very fast (<1ms) inference times.
