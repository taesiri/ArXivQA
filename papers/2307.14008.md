# [Adaptive Frequency Filters As Efficient Global Token Mixers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14008)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is exploring how to design an efficient vision transformer backbone that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for practical applications. Specifically, the paper proposes a new token mixing approach called Adaptive Frequency Filtering (AFF) to replace the computationally expensive self-attention mechanism in standard vision transformers. The main hypothesis is that adaptive frequency filters can serve as an efficient way to perform global token mixing, by utilizing the convolution theorem to convert token mixing into frequency filtering.The major research questions addressed in this paper include:- Can adaptive frequency filters be an effective and efficient alternative to self-attention for global token mixing in vision transformers?- How should the frequency filtering operation be designed to enable semantic-adaptive and channel-adaptive mixing? - Can a vision transformer backbone built with the proposed AFF token mixer achieve superior accuracy and efficiency trade-offs compared to other lightweight network designs?Through theoretical analysis, architecture designs, and extensive experiments, the paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AFF token mixer and the AFFNet backbone built with it. The goal is to develop a high-performance yet lightweight vision transformer that is suitable for practical applications on edge devices.In summary, the core hypothesis is using adaptive frequency filtering for efficient global token mixing, and the key research questions focus on designing the frequency filtering operation and evaluating its capabilities as a replacement for standard self-attention in lightweight vision transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new vision transformer model called Twins that uses a simple yet effective spatial attention mechanism. The key ideas are:1. It proposes a two-branch architecture consisting of a local spatial attention (LSA) module and a global spatial attention (GSA) module. 2. The LSA module divides the input feature map into non-overlapping windows and applies self-attention within each window to capture fine-grained details.3. The GSA module first applies a strided convolution to downsample the feature map, then performs self-attention on this downsampled map to capture long-range dependencies.4. The outputs of the LSA and GSA modules are combined to produce the final embeddings.5. This divided spatial attention design is simple yet effective. It allows the model to jointly attend to local and global contexts, capturing multi-scale spatial relationships in an efficient manner.6. The authors show that Twins achieves competitive results on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed spatial attention mechanism.In summary, the core contribution is the novel two-branch spatial attention design that divides the attention into local and global components. This provides an efficient way for vision transformers to model both fine details and long-range dependencies in images.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new vision transformer architecture called Twins that introduces a simple yet effective spatial attention mechanism. The key ideas are:1. The model has two components - a local spatial attention (LSA) module that captures fine details, and a global spatial attention (GSA) module that models long-range dependencies. 2. The LSA module divides the input into non-overlapping windows and applies self-attention within each window.3. The GSA module first sub-samples the input tokens into a lower resolution via strided convolution, then applies self-attention on the global tokens, followed by upsampling to restore the original resolution.4. By combining both local and global attention, Twins achieves strong performance on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with improved efficiency compared to standard vision transformers.In summary, the main contribution is a new spatial attention design for vision transformers that captures both local and global information effectively and efficiently.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more optimized implementations of FFT/iFFT for deep learning frameworks to reduce computational costs. The authors point out that currently FFT has not undergone the same level of low-level optimization as convolutional neural networks, so optimizing FFT could help close the efficiency gap. - Exploring lightweight designs tailored for specific downstream tasks like detection, segmentation, pose estimation etc. This work focuses on general-purpose backbones, but task-specific designs could further improve efficiency.- Applying the idea of using frequency domain filtering for token mixing in other domains beyond computer vision, such as natural language processing. The authors suggest the approach could have benefits in other fields as well.- Further theoretical analysis of why frequency domain filtering works well as an efficient token mixing operation, and under what conditions it can provide advantages.- Exploring other possible frequency domain operations or transformations that could enable efficient token mixing.- Combining the idea with other techniques like knowledge distillation to further optimize the accuracy and efficiency.Overall, the main future directions are around 1) optimizing the engineering implementation of frequency domain operations like FFT, 2) exploring task-specific lightweight designs, 3) extending the approach to other domains beyond vision, 4) more theoretical analysis, and 5) investigating other related frequency domain techniques for efficient token mixing.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Reformer, a Transformer model that uses reversible layers and locality-sensitive hashing to improve efficiency on long sequences. The key ideas are:- Reversible layers allow executing the network forwards and backwards in O(1) memory, rather than O(n) memory required by normal backpropagation. This allows handling much longer sequences.- Locality-sensitive hashing is used to limit attention to tokens within the same "bucket". This reduces the overall attention complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlog(n)). - Together, these modifications allow the Reformer to handle sequences with over 10,000 tokens, while maintaining performance close to standard Transformers. Experiments show Reformer matches BERT's performance on language modeling and GLUE benchmarks while using less computation.The limitations are that Reformer may lose some accuracy due to only considering local tokens within each bucket, and hash collisions may group unrelated tokens together. The hashing scheme also requires careful tuning for different sequence lengths. But overall, Reformer demonstrates how Transformer models can be adapted to improve efficiency and handle longer sequences.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Reformer, a more efficient transformer model for processing long sequences. The standard transformer self-attention has quadratic memory and compute requirements with respect to sequence length, making it impractical for very long sequences. Reformer introduces two main modifications to improve efficiency. First, it uses locally sensitive hashing to group tokens into "buckets" and limit self-attention computation to only tokens that hash to the same bucket. This reduces the complexity from O(N^2) to O(NlogN). Second, Reformer uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residual connections, which allows storing only one intermediate activation at a time instead of two. This reduces the memory requirements by up to 50%. Together, these modifications allow Reformer to handle sequences with tens of thousands of tokens using hundreds of layers. Experiments show Reformer achieves state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks while being more parameter- and memory- efficient than transformers. A limitation is that performance starts degrading with very long sequences due to approximations in self-attention. Overall, Reformer demonstrates it is possible to effectively model long sequences with transformers at reduced compute costs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Reformer, a Transformer model that uses reversible layers and locality-sensitive hashing to improve efficiency on long sequences. The main method is:- Reformer uses reversible residual layers which allow the inputs to be reconstructed from the outputs. This reduces memory usage and allows training deep networks. - It uses locality-sensitive hashing for attention. The attention matrix is split into buckets using hashes of query and key vectors. Attention is only computed between queries and keys in the same bucket. This reduces the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N). - Reformer also chunks long sequences into smaller segments so that self-attention can be applied locally within each segment, further reducing complexity.In summary, Reformer improves the efficiency of Transformers on long sequences through 1) reversible residual layers, 2) locality-sensitive hashing attention, and 3) chunking sequences into segments. This reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.

MobileViTs also achieve much better performance compared to prior ViT models designed for efficiency like DeiT when evaluated on mobile platforms in terms of latency, throughput, and energy consumption.5. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of design choices related to model architecture, training strategies, and inference optimizations to build efficient vision transformers for on-device usage scenarios. In summary, the key question addressed is how to design mobile-friendly vision transformer models that can surpass the accuracy and efficiency of state-of-the-art mobile convolutional networks. The MobileViT family proposed in this paper offers an effective solution through careful architecture search and training methodology optimizations.
