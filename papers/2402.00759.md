# [Building Expressive and Tractable Probabilistic Generative Models: A   Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Generative modeling aims to model complex data distributions, but faces tradeoffs between flexibility to capture complex dependencies (expressivity), and ability to efficiently compute inferences like probability densities, marginals etc (tractability). Classical probabilistic graphical models are tractable but not very expressive, while modern deep generative models (DGMs) based on neural nets are highly expressive but lack exact & efficient inference. 

Solution:
The paper provides a unified perspective on Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) - a family of tractable graphical models that strike a balance between tractability and expressivity via mixtures and structured factorizations. It discusses algorithms to learn both their parameters and structures from data. It also explores recent techniques to make them more expressive by incorporating elements from neural networks and DGMs to create hybrid models.

Key Contributions:

- Provides a taxonomy categorizing techniques to design expressive PCs via better learning algorithms and structural extensions 

- Outlines probabilistic interpretations of neural concepts like attention and convolutions to enable infusion in PCs

- Discusses training PCs by distilling knowledge from complex but intractable DGMs into PCs

- Explores hybrid models merging PCs with Variational Autoencoders and Normalizing Flows

- Identifies open challenges like theoretically understanding overparameterized PCs, incorporation of symmetries and equivariances for relational data, multi-modal modeling etc.

In summary, the paper provides a holistic understanding of the motivations, techniques and recent advancements in designing expressive and tractable probabilistic circuits, while identifying promising future directions for probabilistic generative modeling.
