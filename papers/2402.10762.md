# [On Explaining Unfairness: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "On Explaining Unfairness: An Overview":

Problem:
As artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used to automate decisions in critical domains like healthcare, education, finance, etc., concerns have been raised about their potential to exhibit biases against protected demographic groups. Explaining and mitigating such biases or unfairness is crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. However, there has been little work at the intersection of explainability and fairness. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a systematic overview of work on explaining unfairness in AI systems. The key contributions are:

1. Comprehensive taxonomies of fairness and explanation methods:
    - Fairness taxonomy covers level, criteria, stage, tasks, and data modalities. 
    - Explanation taxonomy covers stage, model access, coverage, output, task specificity.

2. Identification of 3 directions for explaining unfairness:
    (a) Enhancing fairness metrics using explanations
    (b) Understanding causes of unfairness using explanations 
    (c) Designing methods to mitigate unfairness using explanations

3. Detailed analysis of existing approaches for explaining unfairness:
    - Most use counterfactual explanations to measure unfairness burden or bias. 
    - Some use Shapley values to explain feature contributions to unfairness.
    - Cover classification and recommendations, focus on group fairness.

4. Outlines several promising future research directions, including:
    - Exploring more types of fairness definitions
    - Bridging individual vs. group fairness
    - Expanding to more ML tasks 
    - Generating diverse explanation types
    - Developing new metrics balancing utility, fairness and explainability

By systematically categorizing the landscape of explaining unfairness and identifying research gaps, this paper provides valuable insights to guide future work towards trustworthy and transparent AI systems.
