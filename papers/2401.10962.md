# [One Step Learning, One Step Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current prevailing full fine-tuning method for visual models suffers from knowledge forgetting issue as it focuses solely on fitting the downstream training set, leading to reduced accuracy on both upstream and downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution:  
- A novel weight rollback-based fine-tuning method called OLOR (One step Learning, One step Review) that combines fine-tuning with optimizers by incorporating a weight rollback term into the weight update at each step.

- Weight rollback brings current weights closer to pre-trained weights to mitigate overfitting and knowledge forgetting. Avoids delay defects by incorporating current gradient into penalty term.

- A layer-wise penalty employs penalty decay and diversified decay rate to adjust rollback levels of layers. Gives more rollback to shallow layers and less to deeper layers. Adapts rollback levels to task variations.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes OLOR method that cooperates with optimizers to address knowledge forgetting and improve fine-tuning.

- Weight rollback design avoids delay defects and smoothens review process. Layer-wise penalty enhances adaptation to varying downstream tasks.  

- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on extensive downstream tasks including different types of classification, detection and segmentation using diverse backbones.

- Validation experiments and analysis demonstrate OLOR's effectiveness in mitigating knowledge forgetting and rationality of parameters.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel optimizer-based fine-tuning approach OLOR to tackle the knowledge forgetting issue. It achieves superior performance on diverse vision tasks while avoiding common defects of existing methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method called OLOR that incorporates a weight rollback term into the weight update. Can you explain in more detail how this weight rollback term is calculated and incorporated? What is the intuition behind using this to mitigate knowledge forgetting?

2. OLOR is implemented by combining with popular optimizers like SGD and Adam. Can you explain how the algorithms differ for SGD and Adam versions? What changes need to be made to the typical SGD/Adam update rules? 

3. The paper identifies a "delay defect" in previous regularization techniques like weight decay. Can you explain this defect and why it causes unintended behavior? How does OLOR address this issue?

4. Explain the penalty decay mechanism in the layer-wise penalty component of OLOR. Why is it reasonable to apply less weight rollback for deeper layers? What assumptions does this rely on?

5. The diversified decay rate is introduced to make the penalty decay more adaptive across tasks. Can you explain how this exponent helps adjust the decay rate? When would you set this exponent to a larger vs. smaller value?

6. Walk through the process of selecting the hyperparameters ι1, ι2, γ for the layer penalties when applying OLOR to a new dataset. What factors determine suitable values? 

7. The paper shows OLOR outperforms prior methods quite significantly on some datasets but more modestly on others. What factors might cause it to have more or less of an impact when fine-tuning?

8. How does OLOR conceptually differ from other techniques like L2-SP and VPT? What are possible advantages or disadvantages compared to those methods?

9. The paper hypothesizes that shallower layers require fewer updates compared to deeper layers. Do you think this assumption always holds? Can you think of counter examples?

10. Could the ideas in OLOR be extended to continual learning scenarios with a sequence of tasks? What modifications might be needed?
