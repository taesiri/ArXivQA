## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Harmonic Mobile Manipulation (HarmonicMM), an end-to-end learning approach that jointly optimizes navigation and manipulation for complex mobile manipulation tasks. The authors argue that separating navigation and manipulation modules, as done in prior work, fails for tasks requiring coordinated movement. To address this, they propose HarmonicMM which controls all degrees of freedom simultaneously using visual observations and proprioception. They introduce the Daily Mobile Manipulation Task Suite benchmark comprised of challenging tasks like opening doors, cleaning tables, and opening fridges in visually diverse simulated houses. Experiments demonstrate that HarmonicMM outperforms prior methods by 17.6% in average success rate across tasks. It exhibits emergent coordinated behaviors like reaching towards objects while moving. HarmonicMM also transfers successfully to a real apartment setting without any fine-tuning, validating its ability to bridge the reality gap. Through both the new benchmark and learning approach, this work pushes towards more capable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many everyday household tasks require coordinated mobile manipulation, such as opening doors or cleaning tables. However, most prior work in robotics treats navigation and manipulation separately, which fails on tasks needing synchronized actions. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling robots to perform complex mobile manipulation tasks that require concurrent navigation and manipulation.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach called Harmonic Mobile Manipulation (HarmonicMM) that jointly optimizes for navigation and manipulation. The key ideas are:

1) Train the model entirely in simulation using ProcTHOR environments with additional functionality for tasks like opening doors and cleaning tables. This allows learning complex behaviors without real-world trial-and-error.

2) Use an end-to-end model that takes as input visual observations and robot proprioception and outputs simultaneous navigation and manipulation actions. This enables concurrent control unlike prior work.

3) Design a coordinated reward function that incentivizes progress towards task completion through coordinated navigation and manipulation.

The proposed HarmonicMM method demonstrates substantial improvements averaged across tasks compared to prior methods.

Main Contributions:

1) A new benchmark called the Daily Mobile Manipulation Task Suite focusing on tasks requiring concurrent navigation and manipulation, including opening doors, cleaning tables, opening fridges.

2)Expanding ProcTHOR simulation capabilities to support the new task suite through additional functionalities.

3) The HarmonicMM model that coordinately learns mobile manipulation, outperforming prior approaches by 17.6% averaged across the benchmark tasks.

4) Successful sim-to-real transfer by deploying HarmonicMM on a physical robot in real unmodified apartments, demonstrating the feasibility of complex mobile manipulation via end-to-end learning.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions towards enabling robots to perform daily household activities through synchronized navigation and manipulation abilities learned entirely in simulation and transferred to the real world.
