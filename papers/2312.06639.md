## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Harmonic Mobile Manipulation (HarmonicMM), an end-to-end learning approach that jointly optimizes navigation and manipulation for complex mobile manipulation tasks. The authors argue that separating navigation and manipulation modules, as done in prior work, fails for tasks requiring coordinated movement. To address this, they propose HarmonicMM which controls all degrees of freedom simultaneously using visual observations and proprioception. They introduce the Daily Mobile Manipulation Task Suite benchmark comprised of challenging tasks like opening doors, cleaning tables, and opening fridges in visually diverse simulated houses. Experiments demonstrate that HarmonicMM outperforms prior methods by 17.6% in average success rate across tasks. It exhibits emergent coordinated behaviors like reaching towards objects while moving. HarmonicMM also transfers successfully to a real apartment setting without any fine-tuning, validating its ability to bridge the reality gap. Through both the new benchmark and learning approach, this work pushes towards more capable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments.
