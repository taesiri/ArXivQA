# [The SMART approach to instance-optimal online learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of online learning, where at each time step the learner chooses an action, suffers a loss, and aims to minimize regret (difference in total loss compared to best fixed action in hindsight). The goal is to design an algorithm that is "instance optimal", meaning it achieves regret competitive with the best of two algorithms - Follow-The-Leader (FTL, optimal for stochastic settings) and a worst-case optimal algorithm (e.g. Cover's algorithm). Specifically, the aim is an algorithm with regret at most $\gamma$ times $\min\{\text{Regret}_{\text{FTL}}, \text{Regret}_{\text{Cover}}\}$ for some constant $\gamma$. 

Proposed Solution - The SMART Algorithm:
The paper proposes the "Switching via Monotone Adapted Regret Traces" (SMART) algorithm. SMART starts by playing FTL. In parallel, it tracks an anytime estimate of FTL's regret. If this estimate exceeds the worst-case regret bound of the Cover algorithm for the remaining rounds, SMART switches to playing Cover for the rest of the game. 

Main Results:
- SMART achieves regret within a factor $(e/(e-1)) \approx 1.58$ times the minimum regret of FTL and any given worst-case optimal algorithm. This holds for any online learning problem where the worst-case algorithm's regret guarantee is known.
- For binary prediction, SMART achieves regret within 1.58 times the minimum of the regret of FTL and Cover. This is shown to be nearly optimal - no algorithm can achieve a factor better than 1.43.
- SMART can be extended to compete against FTL and algorithms with small loss bounds, achieving regret within a constant factor of the minimum regret.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in formulating the goal of instance optimality and providing an elegant, modular algorithm based on a reduction to ski rental that provably achieves this goal within near optimal constant factors across general online learning settings.
