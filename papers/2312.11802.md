# [IKT-BT: Indirect Knowledge Transfer Behavior Tree Framework for   Multi-Robot Systems Through Communication Eavesdropping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper examines different knowledge transfer modalities - direct and indirect - for groups of robots to efficiently share and update their knowledge in the context of search and rescue missions. The goal is to compare the performance of different modalities in terms of target retrieval rates, knowledge updates, and propagation across robots with varying opportunities to acquire knowledge.

Proposed Solutions:
Four knowledge transfer modalities are studied:
1) Query-Response-Action (QRA): Robots query others when lacking knowledge, receive responses, and act but don't retain information.  
2) Query-Response-Update (QRU): Adds knowledge retention to QRA through updates after responses.
3) Eavesdrop-Update (EU): Robots eavesdrop on messages between others and directly update own knowledge.
4) Eavesdrop-Buffer-Update (EBU): Eavesdropped messages are stored in buffers for timed duration before update.

The performance metrics analyzed are:
- Target retrieval rates over time
- Knowledge updates through querying vs eavesdropping 
- Effective query percentages
- Knowledge levels across robots

Main Contributions:
- Validation that indirect modalities (EU, EBU) outperform direct (QRA, QRU) for higher target retrieval rates. This is attributed to reduced querying delays.
- Demonstration that opportunities significantly impact knowledge updates and levels across robots for all modalities. Higher opportunities result in more updates and higher knowledge levels.  
- Analysis showing buffer-based EBU modality adapts updates based on condition frequencies, saving computation compared to EU. But EU showed faster updates.
- Overall, the studies quantify advantages of indirect modalities for efficient knowledge propagation even in low opportunity scenarios. The suitability of buffer vs non-buffer based indirect transfer depends on the task constraints.
