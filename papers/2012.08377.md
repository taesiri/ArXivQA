# CARE: Commonsense-Aware Emotional Response Generation with Latent   Concepts

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that combining rationality (commonsense) and emotion into conversational agents can improve response quality and human ratings. The authors note that most existing conversational AI models tend to specialize in either rationality or emotion, but not both. This can lead to dull, generic, or unrelated responses. They hypothesize that blending these two elements together can produce better conversational responses.To test this hypothesis, the paper focuses specifically on incorporating commonsense knowledge as the rationality element, and discrete emotions as the emotional element. It proposes a model called CARE that constructs "latent concepts" from a commonsense knowledge graph, and incorporates those concepts into emotional response generation. The experiments then evaluate whether CARE produces better responses compared to models that only incorporate commonsense or emotion alone. The results provide evidence that combining these two elements leads to more natural, appropriate, and human-preferred conversational responses.In summary, the central hypothesis is that conversational agents can be improved by jointly modeling rationality and emotion, rather than just one or the other. The CARE model and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing CARE, a novel model for commonsense-aware emotional response generation. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Identifying the problem of existing conversational models lacking either rationality or emotion, which leads to dull or unrelated responses. The paper hypothesizes that combining rationality and emotion can improve response quality.2. Focusing on commonsense knowledge as an aspect of rationality, and proposing CARE to generate responses that are both commonsense-aware and emotional. 3. Constructing an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph (EA-CKG) by augmenting ConceptNet with emotional triplets extracted from conversations.4. Proposing a framework to construct latent concepts from the EA-CKG embeddings for generating commonsense-aware emotional responses.5. Introducing three methods (emotion-aware graph attention, dynamic label smoothing, concept-aware top-K decoding) to incorporate the latent concepts into the Transformer-based response generation model.6. Conducting extensive experiments on two conversational datasets to demonstrate CARE's ability to produce better commonsense-aware emotional responses than state-of-the-art models. The results support the hypothesis that combining rationality and emotion improves response quality.In summary, the key contribution is proposing CARE to address the lack of either rationality or emotion in existing conversational models, through constructing and incorporating commonsense and emotional latent concepts into response generation. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CARE.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel model called CARE for generating emotional responses that are aware of commonsense knowledge by constructing latent concepts from an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph and incorporating them into a Transformer model through attention, optimization, and sampling techniques.
