# [CARE: Commonsense-Aware Emotional Response Generation with Latent   Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08377)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that combining rationality (commonsense) and emotion into conversational agents can improve response quality and human ratings. 

The authors note that most existing conversational AI models tend to specialize in either rationality or emotion, but not both. This can lead to dull, generic, or unrelated responses. They hypothesize that blending these two elements together can produce better conversational responses.

To test this hypothesis, the paper focuses specifically on incorporating commonsense knowledge as the rationality element, and discrete emotions as the emotional element. It proposes a model called CARE that constructs "latent concepts" from a commonsense knowledge graph, and incorporates those concepts into emotional response generation. 

The experiments then evaluate whether CARE produces better responses compared to models that only incorporate commonsense or emotion alone. The results provide evidence that combining these two elements leads to more natural, appropriate, and human-preferred conversational responses.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that conversational agents can be improved by jointly modeling rationality and emotion, rather than just one or the other. The CARE model and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CARE, a novel model for commonsense-aware emotional response generation. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Identifying the problem of existing conversational models lacking either rationality or emotion, which leads to dull or unrelated responses. The paper hypothesizes that combining rationality and emotion can improve response quality.

2. Focusing on commonsense knowledge as an aspect of rationality, and proposing CARE to generate responses that are both commonsense-aware and emotional. 

3. Constructing an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph (EA-CKG) by augmenting ConceptNet with emotional triplets extracted from conversations.

4. Proposing a framework to construct latent concepts from the EA-CKG embeddings for generating commonsense-aware emotional responses.

5. Introducing three methods (emotion-aware graph attention, dynamic label smoothing, concept-aware top-K decoding) to incorporate the latent concepts into the Transformer-based response generation model.

6. Conducting extensive experiments on two conversational datasets to demonstrate CARE's ability to produce better commonsense-aware emotional responses than state-of-the-art models. The results support the hypothesis that combining rationality and emotion improves response quality.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing CARE to address the lack of either rationality or emotion in existing conversational models, through constructing and incorporating commonsense and emotional latent concepts into response generation. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CARE.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel model called CARE for generating emotional responses that are aware of commonsense knowledge by constructing latent concepts from an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph and incorporating them into a Transformer model through attention, optimization, and sampling techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of emotional conversational AI:

- This paper focuses on combining rationality (commonsense) and emotion to improve response quality in conversational agents. Most prior work has focused on only one aspect - either rationality or emotion. So this work explores a new direction of blending these two qualities.

- The idea of using knowledge graphs and graph embeddings to incorporate external commonsense knowledge is fairly common in recent conversational AI research. However, augmenting the knowledge graph with emotional triplets extracted from data and using it to construct emotional latent concepts is a novel contribution of this paper.

- For incorporating emotion, many prior works have used adversarial training, conditioned language models, or auxiliary emotion classifiers. The methods proposed in this paper for incorporating latent concepts during attention, optimization, and decoding are simpler yet effective alternatives.

- This is the first work that systematically evaluates combining commonsense and emotion for conversational response generation. The results support the hypothesis that blending these two qualities can improve response quality, which is a valuable finding for the community.

- Compared to large pre-trained models like CTRL, this method has much lower complexity allowing it to be easily deployed in real applications. So it explores a better tradeoff between response quality and efficiency.

- One limitation is the mediocre accuracy of the emotion classifier used to annotate training data. This could potentially be improved in future work with larger emotion datasets or leveraging BERT-like models.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel model architecture and training methods to address the new problem of commonsense-aware emotional response generation. The results demonstrate the value of combining rationality and emotion for conversational AI. It opens up a promising research direction that can potentially complement existing methods focused solely on rationality or emotion.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced methods for extracting emotional conversational concept pairs (CCPs) from dialogues, beyond just using PMI. The authors mention potentially using few-shot learning methods.

- Improving the accuracy of the emotion classifier used to label the training data with emotions. The authors suggest this could be done by leveraging few-shot learning on large pretrained language models like BERT.

- Extending the model to incorporate other aspects of rationality beyond just commonsense knowledge, such as logical reasoning capabilities. 

- Evaluating the model's performance on a broader range of emotions beyond just Ekman's basic emotions. The authors suggest the model could be extended to handle more nuanced and complex emotions.

- Exploring different methods for constructing the emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph (EA-CKG), beyond just augmenting ConceptNet.

- Applying and evaluating the model on additional conversational tasks beyond just open-domain chitchat, such as task-oriented dialog.

- Conducting more comprehensive human evaluations to assess additional qualities like engagement, conversational depth, etc.

In summary, the main directions are improving the methods for extracting emotional knowledge, enhancing the emotion classification, incorporating more aspects of rationality, expanding the range of emotions covered, constructing better knowledge graphs, and evaluating on more tasks and metrics.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CARE, a novel model for commonsense-aware emotional response generation in conversational agents. The key idea is to combine rationality and emotion to improve the quality of generated responses. The authors focus on commonsense as an important aspect of rationality, and represent emotion in a discrete manner using Ekman's basic emotions. 

To generate commonsense-aware emotional responses, CARE first constructs latent concepts from an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph (EA-CKG). This allows reasoning over relational and emotional connections between concepts. CARE then incorporates the latent concepts into the response generation process through three collaborative methods: emotion-aware graph attention, dynamic label smoothing, and concept-aware top-K decoding. Experiments on two conversational datasets demonstrate that CARE produces more accurate emotional responses with increased commonsense compared to existing models focusing solely on either emotion or commonsense. The results support the hypothesis that combining rationality and emotion improves response quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a commonsense-aware emotional response generation model called CARE. The key method is to construct latent concepts from an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph (EA-CKG) using knowledge graph embeddings, and incorporate the concepts into response generation. Specifically, the EA-CKG is built by augmenting ConceptNet with emotional triplets extracted from conversations using PMI statistics. The model uses TransE to learn concept and relation embeddings on the EA-CKG. Given a message and desired emotion, it constructs relational and emotional latent concepts using the EA-CKG embeddings. Three methods are then proposed to incorporate the concepts: 1) emotion-aware graph attention to attend more related concepts, 2) dynamic label smoothing to enforce concept supervision, and 3) concept-aware top-K sampling to generate more concept-related tokens. Experiments on two conversational datasets show CARE can produce more accurate and commonsense-aware emotional responses than previous models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem that existing conversational AI models tend to specialize in either rationality (such as incorporating commonsense knowledge) or emotion, but not both. This can lead to responses that are dull, generic, or unrelated. 

The key question seems to be: can combining rationality and emotion in conversational agents lead to improved response quality and human ratings?

To address this, the paper specifically focuses on commonsense knowledge as an aspect of rationality, and discrete emotions as a representation of emotion. It proposes a model called CARE that aims to generate responses that are both commonsense-aware and emotional.

The main contributions seem to be:

1) Identifying the limitations of existing models in capturing either rationality or emotion, but not both.

2) Proposing the CARE model to combine commonsense and emotions for response generation.

3) Building an emotion-aware commonsense knowledge graph to support this. 

4) Methods to construct and incorporate latent concepts from this knowledge graph.

5) Evaluations showing CARE can produce better commonsense and emotional responses than other state-of-the-art models.

In summary, the key focus is on improving conversational response quality by combining rationality and emotion, with a specific implementation for commonsense and discrete emotions.
