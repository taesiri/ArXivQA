# [All you need for horizontal slicing in 5G network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11477)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can horizontal slicing be utilized to efficiently share resources and satisfy service level agreements (SLAs) between infrastructure providers and tenants in 5G networks?The paper provides an overview of 5G networks, network slicing concepts, and focuses on evaluating horizontal slicing approaches to allocate resources and meet quality of service requirements specified in SLAs. The main hypothesis appears to be that by optimizing horizontal slicing through things like properly weighting network slices and allocating bandwidth, the model proposed in the paper can satisfy SLAs for multiple virtual network operators sharing the same physical infrastructure. The case study and simulations aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed horizontal slicing model.In summary, the key research question is how to leverage horizontal slicing techniques to efficiently and fairly share 5G network resources across tenants and meet service quality guarantees outlined in SLAs. The paper proposes and evaluates an optimization model for horizontal slicing to address this question.
