# [All you need for horizontal slicing in 5G network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11477)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can horizontal slicing be utilized to efficiently share resources and satisfy service level agreements (SLAs) between infrastructure providers and tenants in 5G networks?The paper provides an overview of 5G networks, network slicing concepts, and focuses on evaluating horizontal slicing approaches to allocate resources and meet quality of service requirements specified in SLAs. The main hypothesis appears to be that by optimizing horizontal slicing through things like properly weighting network slices and allocating bandwidth, the model proposed in the paper can satisfy SLAs for multiple virtual network operators sharing the same physical infrastructure. The case study and simulations aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed horizontal slicing model.In summary, the key research question is how to leverage horizontal slicing techniques to efficiently and fairly share 5G network resources across tenants and meet service quality guarantees outlined in SLAs. The paper proposes and evaluates an optimization model for horizontal slicing to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Providing an overview of 5G networks, including the architecture, key characteristics, and how 5G differs from previous generations of mobile networks.- Discussing the role of SDN and NFV in enabling network slicing in 5G networks. The paper explains how these technologies allow efficient utilization of physical and virtual resources for network slicing.- Analyzing and proposing an efficient model for 5G horizontal slicing to utilize available network resources. A practical simulation is presented to allocate user weights and data rates to satisfy service level agreements between infrastructure providers and tenants. - Implementing the proposed 5G slicing model using the CVX optimization tool in MATLAB. Experiments are conducted by varying radio link throughput and number of users to study the influence on allocated data rates.- Demonstrating how the proposed horizontal slicing model can satisfy SLAs of different virtual network operators independently under varying radio conditions. The total network capacity is shared efficiently between slices.So in summary, the key contribution appears to be the analysis, proposed model, and sample implementation of 5G horizontal slicing to effectively utilize network resources and satisfy service agreements, validated through simulations. The paper provides useful insights into 5G network slicing.
