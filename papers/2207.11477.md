# [All you need for horizontal slicing in 5G network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11477)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can horizontal slicing be utilized to efficiently share resources and satisfy service level agreements (SLAs) between infrastructure providers and tenants in 5G networks?The paper provides an overview of 5G networks, network slicing concepts, and focuses on evaluating horizontal slicing approaches to allocate resources and meet quality of service requirements specified in SLAs. The main hypothesis appears to be that by optimizing horizontal slicing through things like properly weighting network slices and allocating bandwidth, the model proposed in the paper can satisfy SLAs for multiple virtual network operators sharing the same physical infrastructure. The case study and simulations aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed horizontal slicing model.In summary, the key research question is how to leverage horizontal slicing techniques to efficiently and fairly share 5G network resources across tenants and meet service quality guarantees outlined in SLAs. The paper proposes and evaluates an optimization model for horizontal slicing to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Providing an overview of 5G networks, including the architecture, key characteristics, and how 5G differs from previous generations of mobile networks.- Discussing the role of SDN and NFV in enabling network slicing in 5G networks. The paper explains how these technologies allow efficient utilization of physical and virtual resources for network slicing.- Analyzing and proposing an efficient model for 5G horizontal slicing to utilize available network resources. A practical simulation is presented to allocate user weights and data rates to satisfy service level agreements between infrastructure providers and tenants. - Implementing the proposed 5G slicing model using the CVX optimization tool in MATLAB. Experiments are conducted by varying radio link throughput and number of users to study the influence on allocated data rates.- Demonstrating how the proposed horizontal slicing model can satisfy SLAs of different virtual network operators independently under varying radio conditions.

The paper provides useful insights into 5G network slicing.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper provides an overview of 5G network architecture and key technologies like software-defined networking, network function virtualization and network slicing, and presents a simulation model for 5G radio access network slicing to allocate resources across multiple virtual network operators according to service level agreements.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of 5G network slicing:- The paper provides a good general overview of 5G network slicing concepts, including the end-to-end architecture, types of slicing, and management framework. This aligns with other review papers on 5G slicing.- The section on slicing at the radio access network (RAN) level provides more technical details compared to some other overview papers. It discusses RAN resource management, control/user planes, admission control, and UE configurations related to slicing. This level of RAN detail is not found in all slicing papers.- The example scenario of slicing across virtual RANs to meet service level agreements is a fairly unique contribution compared to other papers. Many slicing papers stay high-level or theoretical, but this gives a specific algorithm and simulation. The multi-VNO optimization model seems novel compared to other published examples.- The usage of the CVX tool to solve the optimization problem is also an interesting technical contribution compared to theoretical-only papers. Demonstrating an actual MATLAB implementation makes the concepts more tangible.- The performance results analyzing the impact of VNO weights, radio link quality, and number of users add nice insights on slice behavior compared to more conceptual papers. The graphs help visualize the slice performance.- Overall, the mix of overview concepts plus specific algorithm design, implementation, and simulation results provide contributions over papers that focus solely on one aspect. The practical nature of the simulation and results help differentiate this paper from more theoretical slicing papers.In summary, this paper provides a unique blend of 5G slicing concepts, specific algorithm design, CVX implementation, and performance simulations that compare favorably against pure overview or theoretical papers. The RAN focus and simulation results help fill gaps in the literature and make the concepts more concrete.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more sophisticated optimization algorithms for resource allocation in network slicing. The authors used a simple convex optimization approach in their model, but suggest exploring more advanced algorithms.- Testing the network slicing model in a real-world testbed or prototype system. The work in this paper is based on simulations and mathematical modeling. Validating the concepts experimentally would be an important next step.- Exploring different pricing and business models enabled by network slicing. The paper assumes some basic pricing models between infrastructure providers and virtual network operators, but there is room for innovation in how slicing could enable new economic and business relationships.- Extending the model to account for user mobility and changing network conditions. The current model is relatively static, but supporting user mobility and adapting to changing network loads and conditions dynamically is important.- Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques for network monitoring, traffic prediction, and automated network management. The authors suggest network slicing opens up opportunities to apply ML to enhance automation and optimization.- Studying security issues and solutions for network slicing. The paper focuses on resource allocation but security and isolation between slices needs more investigation.- Expanding the model to end-to-end network slicing including edge/fog computing resources. The current model focuses on radio access network slicing, but a full end-to-end model could be developed.In summary, the authors propose taking their model from a theoretical concept to real-world implementation, exploring new technical capabilities enabled by slicing, and addressing open challenges around security, mobility, and end-to-end resource management. Implementing and validating slicing in practice appears to be a key next step.
