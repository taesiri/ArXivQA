## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can horizontal slicing be utilized to efficiently share resources and satisfy service level agreements (SLAs) between infrastructure providers and tenants in 5G networks?

The paper provides an overview of 5G networks, network slicing concepts, and focuses on evaluating horizontal slicing approaches to allocate resources and meet quality of service requirements specified in SLAs. The main hypothesis appears to be that by optimizing horizontal slicing through things like properly weighting network slices and allocating bandwidth, the model proposed in the paper can satisfy SLAs for multiple virtual network operators sharing the same physical infrastructure. The case study and simulations aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed horizontal slicing model.

In summary, the key research question is how to leverage horizontal slicing techniques to efficiently and fairly share 5G network resources across tenants and meet service quality guarantees outlined in SLAs. The paper proposes and evaluates an optimization model for horizontal slicing to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a network slicing model to allocate radio resources across virtual radio access networks (RANs) of multiple virtual network operators (VNOs). The model utilizes a virtual radio resource management (VRRM) module that aggregates and virtualizes radio resource units from different radio access technologies. The VRRM module allocates data rates to the services of each VNO based on a proportional fairness optimization framework, with the goal of maximizing utilization of the total network capacity provided by a common radio resource management (CRRM) module. The optimization uses pre-defined weights for each VNO and service to determine priority in rate allocation, subject to constraints on minimum/maximum data rates per service and overall capacity per VNO based on service level agreement (SLA) contracts. The paper implements this model in MATLAB using the CVX optimization toolbox, and evaluates the impact of varying radio link capacity and number of users on rate allocation to services of different VNOs.
