# [Gridless 2D Recovery of Lines using the Sliding Frank-Wolfe Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11649)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of accurately detecting and estimating the parameters of lines in 2D images. Specifically, it focuses on two scenarios - (1) recovering lines blurred by convolution with a point spread function (PSF) and corrupted by noise, and (2) detecting "ridge" patterns in the spectrograms of signals containing multiple linear chirps. Accurately estimating the lines' positions, orientations and amplitudes from degraded measurements is challenging. 

Prior Work: 
Previous techniques formulated the problem as an atomic norm minimization, which uses convex optimization to reconstruct a sparse representation using "line atoms". However, the optimization convergence was slow and subsequent post-processing to extract line parameters was unstable.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using the Sliding Frank-Wolfe (SFW) algorithm to estimate the lines. This algorithm iteratively adds new lines greedily based on the current estimate and then refines all line parameters jointly. Two kernel functions are designed to model line patterns - (1) Gaussian line kernel models a line convolved with a Gaussian PSF, (2) Chirp line kernel captures ridges in a chirp spectrogram. The line estimation problem then becomes a sparse spike estimation in a suitable parameter space.

Contributions:
- Formulates line estimation as a spike recovery problem enabling the use of SFW algorithm
- Defines two kernels to model blurred lines and chirp spectrogram ridges  
- Achieves higher accuracy in line parameter estimation than previous atomic norm minimization technique
- Faster convergence compared to earlier approach
- Handles complex scenarios like closely spaced lines, noise, interference between chirps

In experiments, the proposed solution demonstrates consistently better estimation of line positions, orientations and amplitudes on both synthetic and real images. The framework is flexible to use different degradation models. Future work includes combining it with denoising methods and using it to analyze local line patterns.
