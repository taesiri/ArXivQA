# [Transforming Image Super-Resolution: A ConvFormer-based Efficient   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05633)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent deep learning based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods have achieved remarkable performance, yet their computational costs remain prohibitive for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Transformer-based SISR models demonstrate superior performance but incur substantial complexity from the self-attention mechanism. Therefore, developing an efficient and lightweight SISR model to balance performance and efficiency is an important challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Convolutional Transformer-based Super-Resolution network (CFSR) for lightweight image super-resolution. The key contributions are:

1) It introduces a Convolutional Transformer layer (ConvFormer) which replaces the self-attention module typically used in transformers with a large kernel convolution-based feature mixer. This ConvFormer layer can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and extensive receptive fields while lowering computational overhead. 

2) It proposes an edge-preserving feed-forward network (EFN) which incorporates image gradient priors using a multi-branch depthwise convolution structure. This enhances extraction of high-frequency details without increasing model complexity during inference, achieved via re-parameterization.

3) Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by CFSR over other lightweight CNN and transformer-based SISR methods. For 4x SR on Urban100, CFSR achieves 0.39dB higher PSNR than ShuffleMixer while using 26% fewer parameters and 31% lesser FLOPs. Qualitative results also showcase CFSR's improved detail retention.

Key Contributions:
1) Efficient ConvFormer layer using large kernel convolutions to replace transformer self-attention  
2) Edge-preserving feed-forward network (EFN) to enhance high-frequency detail retention
3) State-of-the-art lightweight SISR performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs

The proposed CFSR convincingly demonstrates an effective balance between performance and efficiency for lightweight image super-resolution tasks. Its innovations in adapting transformer-based architectures for efficiency make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.
