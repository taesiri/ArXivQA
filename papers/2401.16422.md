# [Strategic Usage in a Multi-Learner Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16422)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Strategic Usage in a Multi-Learner Setting":

Problem:
The paper studies the interaction dynamics between strategic users and multiple machine learning services in a real-world setting. Specifically, it considers a pool of users who can choose to use one of several available services. The services deploy classifiers to make predictions about the users in order to optimize some reward function. Meanwhile, the users choose services strategically in order to receive positive classifications, which wields influence over the data available to each service for training. Prior work on strategic classification focuses on users manipulating their own data, but fails to capture the dynamics when users can simply choose between services. This paper analyzes the strategic usage setting.

Proposed Solution:
The paper formalizes the strategic usage setting where users seek positive classifications by choosing services, while services seek to minimize loss functions over their observations. It shows theoretically and empirically that naive repeated retraining by services can fail to converge in this setting. To address this, the paper proposes retraining updates using memory of past observations. It proves that when services have memory, the system is guaranteed to converge to an invariant set where services experience zero loss and correctly classify the users who choose them. Negative users also leave the system entirely at equilibrium.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the strategic usage problem setting with alternate user and service updates 
- Proof that non-convergence can occur with naive repeated retraining
- Introduction of a novel retraining approach using memory over past observations
- Theoretical results showing memory guarantees convergence to a desirable invariant set within finite time, for any initialization
- Experiments on synthetic and real-world data validating theoretical findings

The key insight is that services need to accumulate knowledge over time through memory in order to contend with strategic users, unlike in traditional strategic classification settings. This allows rigorous convergence guarantees even as the population selecting each service changes dynamically according to strategic incentives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes a multi-service setting where strategic users choose which services to use to pursue positive classifications, while services seek to minimize loss on observations, showing that with memory, system convergence can be guaranteed, but without memory, oscillations may occur.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a formal analysis of the interaction dynamics between strategic users and multiple machine learning services in a setting where users choose which services to use. The key elements of the contribution are:

1) Introducing the novel problem formulation of "strategic usage" where users choose services to obtain positive classifications, impacting the data available to services. This differs from prior work on strategic classification that focuses on users manipulating their own data.

2) Proving that with non-zero memory in service retraining updates, the system is guaranteed to converge to an equilibrium within finite time, unlike naive repeated retraining approaches. 

3) Characterizing the properties of these equilibrium states, showing they are "zero-loss" meaning services make no errors on the users that choose them and negative users opt out entirely.

4) Validating the theoretical findings via experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing the importance of memory for convergence and illustrating complex initialization-dependent transient dynamics.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions towards understanding the complex interactions that arise when strategic users select between machine learning services. The introduction of memory to retraining updates is shown to be a key enabler for guaranteeing convergence.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Strategic usage - Referring to users strategically choosing which services to use in order to pursue positive classifications. This is the main phenomenon studied in the paper.

- Multi-learner dynamics - Studying the interactions between multiple learning services and strategic users. 

- Convergence guarantees - The paper provides convergence guarantees to desirable equilibria under certain conditions, such as the addition of memory.

- Invariant set - The paper defines zero-loss states which form an invariant set under the learning dynamics. 

- Realizable setting - The paper focuses analysis on realizable binary classification settings.

- Retraining updates - Services update their classifiers through retraining on accumulated observations. A key contribution is introducing a novel class of retraining updates involving memory.

- Oscillations - The paper shows that without memory, even realizable settings can lead to oscillations between services and strategic users.

Some other potentially relevant terms are best response dynamics, endogenous distribution shift, performance modeling, and experiential learning. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper assumes that users care about the margin of their prediction, not just the binary prediction itself. How sensitive are the results to this assumption? Would the dynamics fundamentally change if users only cared about the sign of the prediction?

2. You prove convergence guarantees for "sticky" model update rules. What specific model update rules would satisfy this condition in practice? Are there any commonly used update rules that would not satisfy this? 

3. You show memoryless updates can lead to oscillations. Have you explored how much memory is necessary to reliably avoid oscillations? Is there a relationship between the strength of memory $p$ and speed of convergence?

4. How robust is the convergence result to changes in the user and service update schedules? Does asynchronous updating impact the dynamics in any meaningful way?

5. The opportunity cost function for users is assumed to have a specific parameterized form. How sensitive are the results to the exact shape of this cost function? Can you guarantee convergence for more general cost functions?  

6. How do the dynamics change when there are subpopulations of users with heterogeneous preferences over services? Do distinct subpopulation equilibria emerge?

7. You assume services optimize the empirical loss over their observations. What if services optimized more complex objectives involving regularization or constraints? Would your convergence results still hold?

8. What effect would competition between services have on the dynamics? If services could observe and react to the models of competitors would convergence speeds or equilibria be impacted?

9. The dynamics for $m >> n$ users hasn't been explored. What new phenomena emerge when the number of services is much larger than the user population size?

10. This paper focuses on theoretical analysis. For practical applications, can you quantify rates of convergence or develop any heuristic update rules to accelerate progress towards equilibrium?
