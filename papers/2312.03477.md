# [From Detection to Action Recognition: An Edge-Based Pipeline for Robot   Human Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03477)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for human action recognition (HAR) specifically designed for autonomous mobile service robots. The pipeline encompasses human detection, tracking, and action recognition stages, with a focus on using efficient and lightweight algorithms to achieve near real-time performance directly on the robot (edge device). The human detection stage utilizes OpenPose to detect 2D skeletons which are projected to 3D space. A face recognition model identifies the user among multiple people, and a 3D tracking algorithm follows them within the robot's operating space. For the crucial HAR component, the authors perform experiments with state-of-the-art 3D CNN and Transformer models on a newly introduced dataset of daily living activities recorded from the robot's perspective. They determine X3D, with only 2.99M parameters and 6.39 GFLOPs, provides the best balance of recognition performance (98.24% top-1 accuracy) and efficiency (29 FPS) when deployed on the robot. By carefully designing and evaluating solutions suitable for resource-constrained platforms at each pipeline stage, the system can perform end-to-end human action recognition relying primarily on the RGB input of the mobile robot with high FPS in near real-time.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling mobile service robots to understand and respond to human behavior through human action recognition (HAR). HAR is a critical capability for such robots to deduce information about a person's state, behavior and intentions. However, performing HAR on robots poses difficulties due to variations in viewpoint, illumination, shadows, scale, etc. Also, near real-time, on-device performance is crucial to allow the robot to respond and plan accordingly. Moreover, optimizing resource utilization on the robot is essential to avoid overburdening the system. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for human action recognition that is designed for deployment directly on a mobile robot, without needing external hardware offloading. The pipeline encompasses human detection, human tracking, and human action recognition stages. Lightweight and efficient algorithms are carefully selected for each stage with a focus on edge deployment. 

For detection, OpenPose is used to obtain 2D poses which are then projected to 3D. For tracking, a combination of facial recognition and 3D distance-based matching is utilized. For HAR, an overlapping sliding window technique is proposed to handle streaming input. Comparisons are made between state-of-the-art HAR models considering accuracy, memory consumption and inference time when deployed on the robot. The X3D model is found to provide the best balance.

Main Contributions:
- An end-to-end pipeline performing human detection, tracking and action recognition near real-time on a mobile robot
- Introduction of a new dataset combining multiple public datasets along with newly recorded data capturing daily activities 
- Thorough evaluation and analysis of state-of-the-art HAR models focused on resource utilization and real-time edge performance
- Demonstration of the pipeline's effectiveness in enabling mobile robots to understand human behavior relying mainly on RGB camera data

The paper focuses on optimizing the pipeline for edge deployment rather than offloading computation externally. By designing the system end-to-end specifically for a mobile robot, near real-time human action recognition is achieved to allow the robot to respond to human activities.
