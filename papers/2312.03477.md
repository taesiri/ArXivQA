# [From Detection to Action Recognition: An Edge-Based Pipeline for Robot   Human Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03477)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for human action recognition (HAR) specifically designed for autonomous mobile service robots. The pipeline encompasses human detection, tracking, and action recognition stages, with a focus on using efficient and lightweight algorithms to achieve near real-time performance directly on the robot (edge device). The human detection stage utilizes OpenPose to detect 2D skeletons which are projected to 3D space. A face recognition model identifies the user among multiple people, and a 3D tracking algorithm follows them within the robot's operating space. For the crucial HAR component, the authors perform experiments with state-of-the-art 3D CNN and Transformer models on a newly introduced dataset of daily living activities recorded from the robot's perspective. They determine X3D, with only 2.99M parameters and 6.39 GFLOPs, provides the best balance of recognition performance (98.24% top-1 accuracy) and efficiency (29 FPS) when deployed on the robot. By carefully designing and evaluating solutions suitable for resource-constrained platforms at each pipeline stage, the system can perform end-to-end human action recognition relying primarily on the RGB input of the mobile robot with high FPS in near real-time.
