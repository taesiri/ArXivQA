# [From Detection to Action Recognition: An Edge-Based Pipeline for Robot   Human Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling mobile service robots to understand and respond to human behavior through human action recognition (HAR). HAR is a critical capability for such robots to deduce information about a person's state, behavior and intentions. However, performing HAR on robots poses difficulties due to variations in viewpoint, illumination, shadows, scale, etc. Also, near real-time, on-device performance is crucial to allow the robot to respond and plan accordingly. Moreover, optimizing resource utilization on the robot is essential to avoid overburdening the system. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for human action recognition that is designed for deployment directly on a mobile robot, without needing external hardware offloading. The pipeline encompasses human detection, human tracking, and human action recognition stages. Lightweight and efficient algorithms are carefully selected for each stage with a focus on edge deployment. 

For detection, OpenPose is used to obtain 2D poses which are then projected to 3D. For tracking, a combination of facial recognition and 3D distance-based matching is utilized. For HAR, an overlapping sliding window technique is proposed to handle streaming input. Comparisons are made between state-of-the-art HAR models considering accuracy, memory consumption and inference time when deployed on the robot. The X3D model is found to provide the best balance.

Main Contributions:
- An end-to-end pipeline performing human detection, tracking and action recognition near real-time on a mobile robot
- Introduction of a new dataset combining multiple public datasets along with newly recorded data capturing daily activities 
- Thorough evaluation and analysis of state-of-the-art HAR models focused on resource utilization and real-time edge performance
- Demonstration of the pipeline's effectiveness in enabling mobile robots to understand human behavior relying mainly on RGB camera data

The paper focuses on optimizing the pipeline for edge deployment rather than offloading computation externally. By designing the system end-to-end specifically for a mobile robot, near real-time human action recognition is achieved to allow the robot to respond to human activities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for human action recognition on mobile service robots, using efficient algorithms like OpenPose and X3D for near real-time performance while processing entirely on the robot's edge device without offloading computation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An end-to-end solution for recognizing human actions via a mobile robot in near real-time with all processing performed on the edge (on the robot itself rather than offloaded). This uses a 3D-based user tracking algorithm and an overlapping sliding window pre-processing technique for the human action recognition (HAR) model to achieve higher quality predictions.

2. The introduction of a new dataset on daily household activities that combines data from various public datasets as well as newly generated data from a Smart House environment used for rapid prototyping and testing emerging technologies. 

3. A thorough evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art human action recognition models on the proposed dataset, with a focus on analyzing resource utilization and near real-time, on-device performance when deployed on the mobile robot.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient end-to-end pipeline for human action recognition that can run in near real-time directly on a mobile robot using edge computing, enabled by a new combined dataset and benchmarks of HAR models for edge deployment.
