# [Differentially Private Next-Token Prediction of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being widely deployed but can leak private training data. Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy protection but the common method DP-SGD has significant overhead during training. 
- DP-SGD also makes unrealistic assumptions about adversary access to model parameters rather than just query access. More lightweight privacy protection methods are needed that provide privacy specifically during prediction.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Private Mixing of Ensemble Distributions (PMixED), a protocol that provides differential privacy guarantees specifically during next-token prediction from language models. 
- PMixED trains an ensemble of models on partitions of private data. During prediction, it projects output distributions from each model onto a set around a public model's distribution, creating optimal "mollified" distributions. It then averages these and samples the result.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of Renyi Divergence Mollifiers to formalize projecting distributions onto a privacy-preserving set. Uses these to prove PMixED guarantees group-level differential privacy.
- PMixED avoids overhead of differential privacy during training. Ensemble approach and parameter-efficient fine-tuning minimize storage costs. 
- Experiments show PMixED perplexity outperforms DP-SGD baseline for privacy budget epsilon=8 on large-scale datasets. Provides stronger group-level privacy for no utility loss versus per-sample methods.
- Lightweight approach works for black-box query access rather than white-box parameter access assumed by DP-SGD. More realistic threat model for commercial LLM deployment.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions around efficient and practical differential privacy specifically tailored for prediction from large pre-trained language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes PMixED, a private prediction protocol that achieves practical next-token prediction for large language models by projecting the output distributions from an ensemble of fine-tuned models onto the output distribution of a public model, averaging the projected distributions, and sampling from the mixture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of $(\alpha, \beta)$-RD Mollifiers which generalize $\epsilon$-Mollifiers and avoid additive DP noise.

2. Proposal of a private prediction protocol (PMixED) utilizing RD Mollifiers that provides differential privacy guarantees at the group level rather than just the sample level. 

3. Experimental demonstration that PMixED outperforms DP-SGD (the most widely used differentially private training method) on two large-scale language modeling datasets for a reasonable privacy budget.

4. Open-sourcing of the PMixED implementation to promote further research in private prediction of large language models.

In summary, the paper proposes a new method for differentially private predictions from large language models that is more lightweight, flexible, and performant than the prevailing technique of training the models with DP-SGD. The main innovation is using Renyi divergence mollifiers to project each model's predictions onto a public model's predictions in a privacy-preserving way.

The paper introduces a differentially private prediction protocol called PMixED that provides practical next token predictions for large language models while preserving privacy. It utilizes concepts like Renyi divergence mollifiers, sample-and-aggregate, group-level privacy, and Poisson subsampling to develop a lightweight protocol that outperforms differential privacy methods during training like DP-SGD. The key ideas focus on mixing the predictions of an ensemble of fine-tuned models with a public model to reduce memorization of private data. So the core techniques and terms relate to differentially private prediction, Renyi divergence, ensembles, and mixing for improving privacy-utility tradeoffs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Renyi divergence mollifiers to project private model distributions onto a public model distribution. What are the advantages of using Renyi divergence over other divergences like KL divergence for this projection? How does the order Î± impact the effectiveness of the mollification?

2. The paper utilizes an ensemble of models trained on disjoint subsets of the private dataset. How does the size of the ensemble impact the overall privacy guarantee? What is the tradeoff between ensemble size and data efficiency? 

3. The paper argues that PMixED provides a more realistic threat model than DP-SGD by assuming black-box rather than white-box access. What additional threat models could be explored for private deployment of large language models? 

4. How does the choice of decoding strategy (ancestral sampling vs greedy decoding vs top-k sampling etc.) impact the overall privacy analysis? Would adaptations need to be made to PMixED to enable different decoding methods?

5. The privacy level granularity of PMixED depends on the partitioning scheme used for the private dataset. What kinds of partitioning schemes optimize for user-level privacy? How does this compare to sample-level or group-level privacy?

6. The paper uses LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. How do other parameter-efficient methods like BitFit or prompt tuning compare in this framework? What are the tradeoffs?

7. Poisson subsampling is used to further amplify privacy. How does the choice of subsampling probability impact utility? Is there an optimal value that balances privacy and utility? 

8. How does the public model choice impact PMixED's performance? Would further pre-training or fine-tuning the public model be beneficial? What public data sources could be leveraged?

9. The privacy analysis relies on ancestral sampling for decoding. How can the analysis be extended to allow other decoding methods like greedy decoding or top-k sampling?

10. How does PMixED compare to other private prediction methods like PATE or prediction perturbation with noise? What are the advantages and limitations of each approach?
