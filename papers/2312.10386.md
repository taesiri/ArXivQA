# [RedCore: Relative Advantage Aware Cross-modal Representation Learning   for Missing Modalities with Imbalanced Missing Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10386)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal learning suffers from the issue of missing modalities during training or inference due to various reasons like faulty sensors, privacy concerns, etc. This causes performance deterioration.
- Another challenge is imbalanced missing rates across modalities which exacerbates the natural imbalance in multimodal learning and causes under-training of some modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a relative advantage aware cross-modal representation learning approach called RedCore to address these issues. 

- It uses a variational information bottleneck (VIB) based method to learn an optimal representation for each modality that retains maximal information relevant to the task while minimizing irrelevant information.

- For each modality, a cross-modal representation is learned from other available modalities' representations. This representation acts as the imputation for missing modalities.

- To handle imbalanced missing rates, a concept of relative advantage is proposed to quantify how easy/difficult it is for a modality to learn compared to others. 

- A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to adaptively regulate the supervision of modalities based on their relative advantage to achieve balanced learning.

Main Contributions:

- Guarantees supervision efficiency by using available modalities and labels to supervise cross-modal representation learning.

- Achieves balanced learning across modalities through relative advantage aware dynamic supervision regulation.

- Demonstrates superior robustness against missing modalities with either large or imbalanced missing rates through extensive experiments.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to tackle two key challenges in multimodal learning with missing modalities - supervision efficiency and handling imbalance. The VIB based cross-modal representation learning and bi-level optimization for supervision regulation are the main innovations.
