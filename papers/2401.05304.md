# [Can Probabilistic Feedback Drive User Impacts in Online Platforms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recommender systems can negatively impact users in unintended ways, even when the platform's objective is aligned with user welfare. The platform's learning algorithm relies on user reactions (e.g. clicks, likes) to content, but feedback rates for content can vary in ways unrelated to user utility.  

- If feedback rates correlate with certain content properties (e.g. controversiality, creator demographics), differences in how the learning algorithm accounts for feedback rates can inadvertently promote certain kinds of content. This can shape user experience and community dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- Formally model content as arms in a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework with probabilistic user feedback. Introduce measures arm pull count (APC) and feedback observation count (FOC) to capture platform's engagement with content.

- Analyze how no-regret MAB algorithms induce monotonic relationships between arm feedback probabilities and APC/FOC. Show variety of possible monotonicity behaviors using black-box reductions and custom algorithms.

Main Contributions:  
- Initiate study of how MAB algorithm design choices shape platform's differential engagement with content in probabilistic feedback setting

- Construct three black-box transformations of no-regret algorithms which have different monotonicity guarantees for APC and FOC

- Give concrete no-regret algorithms based on UCB, AAE, EXP3 achieving range of monotonicity properties, as well as improved regret bounds  

- Simulation study investigates more general correlations induced by common MAB algorithms

- Highlight the need to look beyond regret when measuring algorithm performance, assess resulting user impacts


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows that even when a platform's objective perfectly aligns with user welfare, its learning algorithm can still negatively impact users by inadvertently promoting certain kinds of content due to differences in feedback rates across content types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper shows that even when a platform's objective is fully aligned with user welfare, the platform's learning algorithm can still induce unintended negative impacts on users. This is because different pieces of content may generate observable user reactions (feedback information) at different rates, and these rates may correlate with content properties like controversiality. The learning algorithm may inadvertently promote certain types of content by responding differently to the heterogeneous feedback rates. 

The paper formalizes measures like arm pull count and feedback observation count to analyze an algorithm's engagement with individual pieces of content. It introduces notions like feedback monotonicity and balance to characterize how these measures change with the feedback rates. Through black-box transformations and analysis of concrete algorithms, the paper shows that no-regret algorithms can exhibit a wide range of dependence between feedback rates and engagement.

The results highlight the importance of looking beyond standard measures like regret when evaluating a learning algorithm, and assessing the nature of its engagement with different types of content as well as the resulting user impacts. The paper provides a framework to analyze such issues rigorously.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multi-armed bandits
- Probabilistic feedback
- Regret minimization 
- User impacts
- Unintended consequences
- Feedback rates
- Arm pull count (APC)
- Feedback observation count (FOC)
- Feedback monotonicity
- Balance
- Alignment of objectives

The paper studies how multi-armed bandit algorithms, even when optimizing a user-aligned objective, can inadvertently lead to negative impacts on users due to differential feedback rates across content. Key terms like "probabilistic feedback," "arm pull count," "feedback observation count," and "feedback monotonicity" are introduced to formalize the relationship between feedback probabilities and algorithmic engagement. The goal is to highlight the importance of looking beyond standard objectives and metrics when assessing the societal impacts of recommender systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the measures of arm pull count (APC) and feedback observation count (FOC) to analyze how bandit algorithms respond to differences in feedback rates across content. What are some limitations or caveats to using APC and FOC as primary evaluation measures, compared to regret?

2. The paper shows that no-regret algorithms can exhibit a wide range of monotonicity properties with respect to APC and FOC. What are some reasons why we may care more about strict monotonicity versus just correlation between feedback rates and APC/FOC?

3. The black-box transformations provide modular ways to convert bandit algorithms for the deterministic setting into ones that handle probabilistic feedback. What challenges arise when trying to analyze the regret and monotonicity properties of these black-box transformations theoretically?

4. How does the dependence on the minimum versus average feedback probability in the regret bounds for BB-Pull(UCB) and BB-Pull(AAE) arise? Why can't similar improvements be achieved for BB-Divide or BB-DivideAdjusted?

5. The improved regret bound for 3-Phase EXP3 matches the stochastic instance-independent regret for BB-Pull(UCB) and BB-Pull(AAE). What is the intuition for why removing the dependence on the minimum feedback probability requires going beyond black-box transformations in the adversarial setting?  

6. Fig. 2 shows that 3-Phase EXP3 can exhibit both positive and negative monotonicity in APC depending on the instance. What modifications could make the monotonicity properties of 3-Phase EXP3 more robust?

7. The empirical study in Section 5 examines correlation on a single instance. How could the methodology be extended to make more general conclusions about typical correlations induced across instances?

8. How do the theoretical measure of regret and the empirical study of correlation provide complementary ways of evaluating algorithmic impacts on users? What are the tradeoffs between focusing analysis on one versus the other?

9. The examples in the introduction indicate societal impacts beyond traditional user experience. What other impacted stakeholders could be considered when evaluating platform algorithms?

10. The paper focuses on aligning the platform objective with user utility. How might other choices in the platform's problem formulation (beyond the objective) also inadvertently impact users?
