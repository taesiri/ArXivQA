# [PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through Visual   Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06566)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we support users in authoring their own chains of Large Language Model (LLM) prompts for prototyping AI-infused applications?

The authors state that while past work has shown the utility of chaining multiple LLM prompts together to accomplish more complex tasks, it remains an open question how to best support users in actually constructing and debugging their own LLM chains. 

To address this question, the authors designed and evaluated an interactive visual programming system called PromptChainer that provides scaffolds and debugging capabilities aimed at making LLM chain authoring more accessible. Their goal was to gain insights into the LLM chain authoring process and identify remaining challenges to guide future work in this emerging area.

So in summary, the key research question is how to design effective tools and interactions to empower non-ML experts to author their own chains of LLM prompts for prototyping purposes. The paper explores this through the design and evaluation of PromptChainer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies three unique challenges that emerge when authoring chains of large language model (LLM) prompts: the versatility of LLMs requiring users to develop a mental model of their capabilities, the instability of LLM "function signatures", and the likelihood of cascading errors due to the blackbox nature of LLMs. 

2. It presents the design of PromptChainer, an interactive interface for visually programming chains of LLM prompts. PromptChainer provides features like node visualization, predefined node types, example galleries, and debugging support to address the identified authoring challenges.

3. It reports on preliminary user studies where participants used PromptChainer to build chains for realistic application ideas. The studies reveal interesting patterns in how users construct and debug chains, as well as remaining challenges around supporting more complex chains and encouraging low-fidelity prototyping of multiple alternatives.

In summary, the core contributions are identifying unique authoring challenges when chaining LLM prompts, proposing the PromptChainer interface to address those challenges, and conducting initial user studies that provide insights into the chain authoring process and directions for future work. The research examines an important emerging area around tools to support end user programming of LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces PromptChainer, a visual programming interface that helps users author chains of large language model prompts to accomplish complex tasks by connecting multiple LLMs together and providing debugging support.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on visual programming for AI:

- This paper focuses specifically on authoring chains of large language model (LLM) prompts, whereas most prior work on visual programming for AI looks at traditional machine learning models like neural networks. Authoring LLM prompts introduces unique challenges like dealing with unstable and opaque outputs. So this work explores new territory.

- The concept of chaining LLM prompts together has been proposed before, but this paper goes further by providing an interface to support authoring the chains. Prior work showed the utility of using pre-made chains, while this work enables users to build their own chains.  

- The visual programming approach draws inspiration from prior systems like node-link diagrams for ML pipelines. However, the design has specific features tailored for LLM chaining like prompt templates, data transformation nodes, and multi-level debugging.

- Evaluation is done through qualitative case studies rather than controlled experiments. This is appropriate given the goal of understanding real use cases and challenges. But it limits generalizability. More controlled evaluations may be needed to compare against other interfaces.

- The paper identifies interesting future challenges like supporting complex interdependent tasks and rapid prototyping of multiple alternatives. These align with open problems in the visual programming literature too.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by addressing the specialized needs of LLM chaining through a purpose-built visual interface. It also points to interesting directions for extending this work through addressing scalability and supporting creative design processes. The qualitative evaluation provides real-world insights, but more controlled comparisons may be needed in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the conclusions and discussion section, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Supporting more complex chains. The user study revealed open challenges in ensuring coherence between interdependent parallel sub-tasks, and in tracking chains with complex logic and decomposition. The authors suggest exploring task decomposition strategies to handle even larger and more complex tasks in the future.

2. Supporting "half-baked" chain construction for low-fi prototyping. To encourage users to explore multiple alternative chain structures rather than getting fixated on their initial prompts and decomposition, the authors suggest future work could explore how to support rapid low-fidelity prototyping of multiple chains. This could involve encouraging users to start with simpler prompts or only 1-2 examples per prompt, so they don't invest too much time upfront before testing chain feasibility.

3. Adding execution visualizations. To help users trace inputs and outputs through complex chains, the authors suggest adding visualizations inspired by Python Tutor to highlight the flow of data through each step in the chain execution.

4. Encouraging node decomposition. When users struggle to successfully prompt a node, the system could potentially suggest decomposing that node into multiple nodes to make prompting easier.

In summary, the main future directions focus on scaling chain authoring to more complex tasks, while also supporting easy exploration of multiple chains through lightweight prompting. Additional features like execution tracing and node decomposition could further aid complex chain construction and debugging.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PromptChainer, a visual interface for authoring chains composed of multiple large language model (LLM) prompts. Through formative studies, the authors identify three challenges unique to chaining LLM prompts: the versatility of LLM capabilities requiring user guidance, the instability of LLM outputs complicating connections between prompts, and the potential for cascading errors. To address these challenges, PromptChainer provides an interactive node-link interface for building chains, predefined nodes capturing common LLM capabilities, automatic handling of connections between prompts, and multi-level debugging support. A preliminary study with four designers/developers found that PromptChainer enabled iteratively constructing and refining chains for diverse applications like chatbots and writing aids. The study also revealed open questions around scaling chains to more complex tasks and supporting rapid exploration of alternative chains. Overall, the work demonstrates an approach to support non-ML experts in authoring their own LLM chains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents PromptChainer, an interface for chaining together multiple prompt-based runs of large language models (LLMs). Chaining LLMs can help users accomplish more complex tasks by decomposing them into a series of smaller sub-tasks, with each sub-task handled by a different LLM prompt. However, it remains challenging for non-ML experts to author their own LLM chains. Through formative studies, the authors identify three key challenges: 1) the need to develop a mental model of LLM capabilities to fully utilize them, 2) the lack of stable "function signatures" for LLMs, meaning outputs can easily vary in format based on small prompt changes, and 3) the potential for cascading errors across a blackbox LLM chain. 

To address these challenges, PromptChainer provides a visual node-link interface for building chains, transforms LLM outputs to be compatible across chain steps, and supports multi-granularity debugging. A preliminary study with four designers/developers showed PromptChainer enabled creating chains for diverse applications like chatbots and writing assistants. Participants used chaining not only to address LLM limitations, but also to make their prototypes more extensible. The study also revealed open questions around scaling chains to complex tasks with interdependency, and how to better support rapid, low-fidelity exploration of multiple chain alternatives. Overall, PromptChainer shows promise in lowering the barriers for end-user programming of LLM chains.
