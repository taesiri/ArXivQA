# [Advancing Generalizable Remote Physiological Measurement through the   Integration of Explicit and Implicit Prior Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06947)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a promising non-contact technology for measuring physiological signals like heart rate from face videos. However, most existing rPPG methods demonstrate good performance on individual datasets but fail to generalize well across datasets due to complex noises arising from different cameras, lighting conditions, skin tones, motions etc. This hinders the practical applicability of rPPG methods. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new method called Greip that improves the generalization ability of rPPG methods by utilizing both explicit and implicit prior knowledge. 

Explicit priors: The paper systematically analyzes and categorizes various noise sources across rPPG datasets into camera noise, lighting noise, skin tone noise and motion noise. It then proposes corresponding data augmentation strategies to inject these explicit noise priors into the network to make the model robust.

Implicit priors: A two-branch network is used to disentangle the rPPG feature distribution from other noises by using the inherent continuity characteristic of heart rate labels. An orthogonal constraint is added between rPPG features and noise features to extract purer physiological signals.

By combining explicit augmentation and implicit feature disentanglement, the proposed Greip method effectively eliminates dataset-specific noises and learns more robust physiological representations.

Main Contributions:
- Systematically analyzes and incorporates 4 types of explicit noise priors using data augmentations 
- Novel use of label continuity as implicit prior to disentangle rPPG features  
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and generalizability between RGB and NIR datasets
- Demonstrates exceptional performance even in self-supervised and semi-supervised settings
- First work to show cross-modal generalization between RGB and NIR videos for rPPG

The proposed Greip framework significantly improves generalization ability of rPPG methods by effectively utilizing prior knowledge, paving way for practical non-contact health measurements.
