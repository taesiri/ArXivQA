# [BELT: Old-School Backdoor Attacks can Evade the State-of-the-Art Defense   with Backdoor Exclusivity Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04902)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes and investigates a new characteristic of backdoor attacks called "backdoor exclusivity," which measures the precision of backdoor activation conditions and the ability of triggers to remain effective under input variations. The authors devise an algorithm to quantify backdoor exclusivity and find that classical backdoor attacks exhibit poor exclusivity, making them vulnerable to detection by state-of-the-art defenses that exploit the existence of "fuzzy triggers." To enhance exclusivity, the authors propose Backdoor Exclusivity Lifting Technique (BELT), which suppresses the association between the backdoor and fuzzy triggers during training, using both "dirty samples" to inject the backdoor and "cover samples" to restrict it. Extensive experiments show BELT can synergize with four classical backdoor attacks across three datasets, boosting their exclusivity to evade six state-of-the-art defenses, while preserving attack success rate and model accuracy. This confirms highly exclusive backdoors are stealthier and more difficult to detect. Overall, the paper provides new insights into designing evasive backdoor attacks and defending against them.
