# [PreAct: Predicting Future in ReAct Enhances Agent's Planning Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- ReAct frameworks for language model agents can explore environments and solve problems through iterative cycles of thought, action, and observation. However, ReAct tends to generate single, direct causal reasoning pathways, limiting effectiveness in complex tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce PreAct, which integrates prediction into the reasoning-action loop. 
- After taking an action, the agent predicts possible future observations and handling measures. 
- Leveraging prediction information enhances the diversity and strategic direction of reasoning.
- This leads to more effective actions in completing complex tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Propose the PreAct framework which synchronizes reasoning, action, and prediction for language model agents.
- Demonstrate PreAct's superior performance over ReAct in accomplishing complex tasks across four datasets.
- Show combining PreAct and Reflexion leads to further performance gains.
- Reveal through ablation studies that historical predictions have a sustained positive influence on planning.
- Analyze how PreAct increases diversity of reasoning and improves directional strategy compared to ReAct.

Overall, the paper introduces PreAct to enhance language model agents via prediction-augmented reasoning, and shows its effectiveness either alone or combined with reflection techniques. The analysis also provides insights into how prediction aids the reasoning process.
