# [Auto DP-SGD: Dual Improvements of Privacy and Accuracy via Automatic   Clipping Threshold and Noise Multiplier Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02400)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Auto DP-SGD that automatically estimates the clipping threshold and noise multiplier to improve the trade-off between privacy and accuracy. The algorithm has two main components: (1) An automatic clipping threshold estimation that adapts the threshold to the decreasing gradient norms during training, avoiding excess noise while lowering sensitivity to improve privacy. (2) An automatic noise multiplier decay that reduces noise over epochs akin to learning rate decay in non-private deep learning. The authors propose and compare four decay mechanisms: linear, time, step and exponential decay. Using the tight privacy accountant of truncated concentrated differential privacy, they formally analyze the privacy guarantee of Auto DP-SGD under different decay types. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and text datasets using both custom and pretrained models, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance - Auto DP-SGD with step decay improves accuracy by up to 6.73% and reduces the privacy budget by up to 94.9% compared to previous DP-SGD algorithms. The results also show the possibility of further enhancing privacy using lower scale factors and learning rate schedulers without compromising utility. Overall, the proposed Auto DP-SGD algorithm successfully bridges the accuracy gap between non-private and private deep learning while ensuring strong privacy guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an automatic differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Auto DP-SGD that automatically estimates the clipping threshold and noise multiplier in each iteration to simultaneously improve accuracy and privacy compared to existing differentially private deep learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an automatic clipping threshold estimation algorithm (Algorithm AC) that computes the clipping threshold for each sample based on the total gradient norm of the model. This avoids excess clipping and improves privacy and accuracy. 

2. It introduces three new automatic noise multiplier decay mechanisms - time decay, exponential decay, and step decay to reduce noise through training. This further enhances privacy and accuracy.

3. It integrates the automatic clipping threshold estimation and automatic noise multiplier decay into the proposed Auto DP-SGD algorithm. 

4. It conducts extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate that Auto DP-SGD, especially the Auto DP-SGD-S variant, outperforms current state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods significantly in terms of privacy and accuracy.

5. It provides mathematical proofs and expressions using the tCDP accountant to analyze the privacy guarantee of the proposed Auto DP-SGD algorithm accurately.

In summary, the core contribution is the proposal of Auto DP-SGD that automatically adapts clipping threshold and noise multiplier to achieve better privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing DP-SGD algorithms. The introduction of automatic clipping and noise decay mechanisms as well as the thorough evaluation and analysis are also key contributions.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) methods suffer from issues like poor privacy accountant choice, uniform clipping, and limited evaluation on complex datasets. 
- These limitations result in greater privacy leakage, lower accuracy compared to traditional DP-SGD, or lack of evaluation on complex datasets like CIFAR100.

Proposed Solution - Auto DP-SGD:
- Automatically estimates per-sample clipping threshold in each iteration based on model's total gradient norm. Avoid operations on batch gradients that compromise privacy.
- Adjusts clipping threshold with decreasing gradient norm during training. Improves privacy and reduces excess noise.
- Introduces automatic noise multiplier decay techniques like time decay, exponential decay, step decay to reduce noise multiplier after each epoch.
- Develops closed-form expressions using truncated concentrated differential privacy (tCDP) accountant to analyze privacy guarantee.

Main Contributions:
- Automatic clipping threshold estimation algorithm that computes clipping threshold for each sample using model's total gradient norm and a scale factor. Avoids clipping.
- Three new automatic noise multiplier decay techniques - time, exponential, step decay.
- Analysis of impact of scale factors, learning rate schedulers, noise decay techniques on accuracy and privacy.
- Auto DP-SGD variants outperform state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods on MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and AG News dataset. 
- Demonstrates improving privacy using lower scale factor and learning rate schedulers with little impact on accuracy.
- Explains selecting best Auto DP-SGD variant that does not need more privacy budget than required for training.

In summary, the paper proposes an Auto DP-SGD technique to automatically tune clipping threshold and noise multiplier during training to achieve better accuracy under a lower privacy budget compared to prior DP-SGD algorithms.
