# [Progress and Prospects in 3D Generative AI: A Technical Overview   including 3D human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02620)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in AI-generated 3D content, including 3D objects, scenes, human models, and motions. 

The key problem being addressed is how to leverage advancements in 2D generative AI, such as diffusion models and GANs, to produce high-quality and consistent 3D models from limited input data like images or text descriptions. Maintaining consistency across different viewing angles remains a major challenge.

For 3D object generation, the paper discusses two main approaches - iterative methods that refine details over multiple passes, and non-iterative "one-shot" methods that produce rougher results very quickly. Notable iterative techniques highlighted include MVDream, SweetDreamer, and RichDreamer, which can achieve photorealistic quality through score distribution sampling optimization. Rapid non-iterative methods like One-2-3-45++ and Direct2.5 employ multi-view diffusion models and 3D fusion techniques like neural radiance fields to generate a model within minutes. Consistency mechanisms like ControlNet are being incorporated.  

For human models, the SMPL framework serves as an effective base representation to build upon. Methods like DreamWaltz, HumanNorm and GTA can produce detailed models with clothing and facial expressions. Combined with semantic zooming and normal map refinements, exceptional quality is achieved through iterative approaches. Rapid non-iterative techniques like Chupa can also generate personality-rich models by fine-tuning stable diffusion outputs.

Scene generation remains more challenging due to limited 3D scene datasets. Innovations like PERF, EXIM and SceneDreamer demonstrate progress in converting 2D panoramas or collections into 3D scenes and environments. SceneDreamer notably pioneers unbounded 3D world generation.

For motion synthesis, large language models are being trained to convert textual descriptions into timed motion sequences. Combined with Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoders andTransformer architectures, methods like Story2Motion, DIMOS and T2M-GPT exhibit remarkable capabilities in choreographing motions. Practical issues like foot sliding still need refinement.

Overall, the rapid advancement across all facets of AI-generated 3D content is enabling new possibilities for 3D artists, gaming environments, advertisements and educational platforms. However, precision of expression still requires human involvement, and consistency remains an ongoing pursuit as the field continues to evolve.
