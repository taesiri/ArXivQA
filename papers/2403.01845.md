# [NASH: Neural Architecture Search for Hardware-Optimized Machine Learning   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As machine learning models get deployed in more applications, they need to achieve better trade-offs between high accuracy, high throughput, and low latency. Existing solutions for improving the accuracy of low-bitwidth models like binary neural networks focus on software optimizations and cannot be directly applied for hardware implementations. There is a need for methods to improve the accuracy of quantized hardware implementations of neural networks.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes NASH, a novel neural architecture search approach to optimize machine learning models specifically for hardware implementation. NASH explores various neural network operations to guide the training process towards higher accuracy models that can be efficiently mapped to hardware. 

Key ideas of NASH:
- Uses a NAS algorithm to identify an optimal "NASH convolution cell" consisting of ops like convolutions, pooling to replace regular convolution layers
- Integrates NASH strategy into FINN - an automated tool for generating quantized NN hardware  
- Presents 4 versions of NASH (NASH-v1 to v4) with different strategies to handle hardware unfriendly ops like max pooling
- Quantization-aware training to generate low-bitwidth models

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes first NAS strategy focused on optimizing NN model accuracy specifically for hardware implementation 

2. Integrates approach into FINN for automated application to models like ResNet

3. Apply NASH to ResNet18 and ResNet34. NASH-ResNet18 shows up to 3.1% higher top-1 accuracy compared to original.

4. Constructs accuracy vs hardware utilization Pareto fronts - NASH models achieve superior tradeoff points on the Pareto front demonstrating best accuracy for given HW resources.

5. Analysis shows smaller models like ResNet18 have better accuracy/HW tradeoff compared to larger ResNet34 after NAS optimization.

In summary, the paper presents a novel NAS strategy for optimizing neural network models for efficient hardware implementation that can achieve higher accuracy and better accuracy/hardware tradeoffs.
