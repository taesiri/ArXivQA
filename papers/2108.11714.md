# [Photos Are All You Need for Reciprocal Recommendation in Online Dating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11714)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can an algorithm that utilizes recurrent neural networks to interpret sequences of user image preferences over time produce more accurate reciprocal recommendations compared to existing content-based and collaborative filtering approaches?The key points about the research question are:- It focuses on reciprocal recommendation (recommending potential matches between users) rather than standard one-way recommendation. - It proposes using recurrent neural networks to model users' image preference histories and make predictions, rather than treating each user action independently.- It compares this approach to existing methods like content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to evaluate if it can improve accuracy.So in summary, the core hypothesis is that using RNNs to model preference histories based on image data can lead to improved accuracy in reciprocal recommendation compared to current state-of-the-art techniques. The paper presents a novel algorithm called TIRR and compares its performance to validate this hypothesis.
