# [WarpDiffusion: Efficient Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Virtual   Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03667)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes WarpDiffusion, a novel framework that combines explicit garment warping with a diffusion model for high-fidelity and efficient virtual try-on image synthesis. WarpDiffusion incorporates a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and a custom local texture attention mechanism to enhance synthesis quality while significantly reducing training requirements compared to recent diffusion-based methods. A key innovation is the Auto Mask module, which refines the warped garment to focus diffusion on critical areas and enable realistic wrinkles and shadows. Experiments on public benchmarks and real-world photos demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with high visual quality, detail preservation, and realistic try-on effects. The method can also easily improve existing warping-GAN approaches in a plug-and-play manner. Limitations include challenges with highly complex poses and garment types. Overall, WarpDiffusion advances virtual try-on generation through an effective fusion of explicit warping and implicit diffusion-based synthesis.
