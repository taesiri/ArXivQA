## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Anomaly detection in energy consumption patterns in buildings is crucial for identifying faults, reducing energy wastage, and enhancing operational efficiency. However, conventional anomaly detection methods face challenges like high false alarm rates, lack of accuracy, and inability to handle complex real-world data.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for accurate and reliable anomaly detection in sports facilities' energy consumption. The key aspects are:

1) Feature extraction from energy consumption data to emphasize temporal cyclic patterns and leverage appliance usage and occupancy information. This aids in creating a nuanced understanding of consumption behaviors.  

2) Problem formulation using Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (DFNN) to model the relationship between various parameters like temperature, time, day type, etc. and energy consumption.

3) Threshold estimation techniques to distinguish anomalies from normal observations effectively. A range of threshold values is explored to optimize anomaly detection.

4) Methods to reduce false alarms by ensuring each data instance appears only once in training and test sets. This enhances reliability.

Main Contributions:

- First application of DFNN for anomaly detection in sports facilities' energy consumption, leveraging DFNN's generalization capability.  

- Comprehensive feature extraction approach tailored to sports facilities by encoding time and day information to capture cyclic patterns.

- Threshold estimation strategies for reliable anomaly identification optimized across buildings and parameters.

- False alarm reduction methodology to improve accuracy.  

- Extensive comparative analysis demonstrating proposed method's superiority over conventional techniques. A 94.33% accuracy and 92.92% F1-score are achieved.

The paper provides valuable insights into harnessing deep learning for anomaly detection in real-world energy systems, enhancing efficiency, sustainability and usersâ€™ comfort.
