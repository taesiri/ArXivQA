# [A Theoretical Analysis of Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00137v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and contributions of this paper are:

1. Provide a theoretical understanding and analysis of the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. 

2. Establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence for the iterative policy sequence obtained by DQN under some mild assumptions.

3. Analyze how the techniques of experience replay and target network used in DQN contribute to its empirical success and stability.

4. Propose an extension of DQN called Minimax-DQN for two-player zero-sum Markov games and provide a similar theoretical analysis.

More specifically, the authors focus on a simplified version of DQN called neural fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and establish its algorithmic and statistical convergence rates. The algorithmic error characterizes how fast the sequence of policies converge, while the statistical error captures the approximation bias and variance from using neural networks to represent the action-value functions. 

The analysis provides theoretical justifications for key elements of DQN - experience replay is shown to provide uncorrelated samples to reduce variance, while target network is related to value iteration. The proposed Minimax-DQN algorithm combines DQN and Minimax-Q learning for Markov games. Similar algorithmic and statistical convergence results are established for Minimax-DQN.

In summary, this paper provides a theoretical foundation for understanding deep Q-networks, which fills an important gap between theory and practice of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The analysis of algorithmic and statistical errors also offers insights into the design and behavior of DQN.
