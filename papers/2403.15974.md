# [CBGT-Net: A Neuromimetic Architecture for Robust Classification of   Streaming Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional neural networks make predictions based on single inputs without considering if the input contains sufficient information. In contrast, decision-making in mammalian brains involves accumulating evidence over time until confidence in a decision is high enough.

- Existing models of basal ganglia circuits have focused on biological aspects of decision-making rather than developing models for machine learning tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a neural network architecture called CBGT-Net inspired by cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits that accumulate evidence supporting potential decisions. 

- The CBGT-Net consists of three main components: 1) An evidence encoder network that encodes observations into evidence values for each potential decision, 2) An evidence accumulator that sums the encoded evidence over time, and 3) A decision threshold module that determines if total evidence exceeds a predefined confidence threshold.

- Once the evidence for a decision exceeds the threshold, the CBGT-Net makes a prediction based on the maximum accumulated evidence.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates CBGT-Net architecture for image classification tasks using streams of small image patches, outperforming LSTM baselines and models using single patches.

- Shows improved accuracy and robustness to patches with less information compared to LSTM models. Requires fewer training examples to converge.

- Provides transparency into model's deliberation process through evidence accumulation towards threshold, useful for human-AI interaction.

- Evidence accumulation allows model to make decisions based on sufficient confidence rather than fixed input volume. Threshold is adjustable to trade-off decision time versus accuracy.

In summary, the paper introduces a bio-inspired neural network architecture that accumulates evidence over time to make more accurate and transparent predictions compared to common recurrent and feedforward approaches.
