# [Surrogate Assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search in Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on a facility location problem of closing down a fixed number of retail stores (e.g. liquor stores) from a network, with the goal of minimizing the total loss of sales resulting from the closures. Evaluating the impact of a store closure is computationally expensive as it requires recomputing network-dependent features like proximity to other stores.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to search for the best set of store closures. To address the expensive computation issue, a fast but less accurate surrogate evaluation function is used alongside the actual evaluation function. This results in a Surrogate-assisted MCTS (SMCTS) approach. SMCTS leverages the surrogate more often to reduce evaluations, but occasionally re-evaluates nodes using the actual function to refine inaccurate values.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes SMCTS for combinatorial optimization problems where evaluation is expensive. SMCTS reduces overall computations by leveraging a surrogate function.
- Demonstrates SMCTS on a retail store closure problem using a liquor store sales dataset. Defines actual and surrogate evaluation functions based on sales regression models.
- Empirically evaluates SMCTS and shows the surrogate function is used more often in larger search spaces. Also shows SMCTS solutions remain consistent with regular MCTS.
- The work is the first application of surrogates to MCTS in combinatorial optimization problems.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a practical SMCTS approach to efficiently solve computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems by leveraging cheaper surrogate evaluations.
