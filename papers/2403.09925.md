# [Surrogate Assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search in Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on a facility location problem of closing down a fixed number of retail stores (e.g. liquor stores) from a network, with the goal of minimizing the total loss of sales resulting from the closures. Evaluating the impact of a store closure is computationally expensive as it requires recomputing network-dependent features like proximity to other stores.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to search for the best set of store closures. To address the expensive computation issue, a fast but less accurate surrogate evaluation function is used alongside the actual evaluation function. This results in a Surrogate-assisted MCTS (SMCTS) approach. SMCTS leverages the surrogate more often to reduce evaluations, but occasionally re-evaluates nodes using the actual function to refine inaccurate values.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes SMCTS for combinatorial optimization problems where evaluation is expensive. SMCTS reduces overall computations by leveraging a surrogate function.
- Demonstrates SMCTS on a retail store closure problem using a liquor store sales dataset. Defines actual and surrogate evaluation functions based on sales regression models.
- Empirically evaluates SMCTS and shows the surrogate function is used more often in larger search spaces. Also shows SMCTS solutions remain consistent with regular MCTS.
- The work is the first application of surrogates to MCTS in combinatorial optimization problems.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a practical SMCTS approach to efficiently solve computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems by leveraging cheaper surrogate evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using a fast but less accurate surrogate evaluation function together with the actual expensive evaluation function in Monte Carlo Tree Search to solve a retail store closure optimization problem more efficiently.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a framework called "Surrogate-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (SMCTS)" for solving computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems. 

Specifically, SMCTS leverages a fast but less accurate "surrogate" evaluation function along with the actual expensive evaluation function in the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. The key ideas are:

1) Use the cheap surrogate function to evaluate nodes in the search tree most of the time, to reduce overall computation time.

2) Occasionally re-evaluate some nodes with the accurate but expensive function, to refine the values and reduce inaccuracies introduced by the surrogate.

3) Demonstrate this approach on a retail store closure optimization problem to minimize lost sales, using a regression model as the expensive evaluation and a simplified model as the surrogate.

The results show that SMCTS can find solutions faster than regular MCTS, while maintaining consistency of the solutions. The framework is also shown to be sensitive to the accuracy of the surrogate function.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel way to inject surrogate models into MCTS to solve expensive optimization problems more efficiently.

The paper proposes using a surrogate-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (SMCTS) approach to solve a retail store closure optimization problem. The goal is to close a fixed number of stores in a liquor store network while minimizing the total sales loss. The main ideas involve using a computationally expensive evaluation function along with a faster, less accurate surrogate function to guide the MCTS. Experiments analyze the performance of SMCTS on a liquor store dataset under different conditions. Overall, the key focus is on leveraging surrogates to improve the efficiency of MCTS for combinatorial optimization problems involving expensive evaluation functions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a surrogate model to speed up the evaluations in MCTS for combinatorial optimization problems. What are some key considerations in choosing an appropriate surrogate model for this approach? How can we balance accuracy versus speed?

2. The re-evaluation step aims to refine inaccurate surrogate evaluations by occasionally calling the main evaluation function. What factors determine the frequency of re-evaluation? How can we automatically adjust this based on surrogate accuracy? 

3. How does the choice of tree policy in MCTS impact the performance of surrogate-assisted MCTS? Would a policy focused more on exploitation be preferred over exploration?

4. The paper evaluates performance on a retail store closure problem. What other combinatorial optimization problems could this approach be applied to? What properties make a problem amenable to this method?

5. How does the accuracy of the surrogate model impact the consistency of solutions found by surrogate-assisted MCTS compared to standard MCTS? Is there a theoretical bound?

6. Could surrogate-assisted MCTS also be applied in problems with stochastic transition dynamics? How would we need to adapt the re-evaluation step?

7. The runtime comparisons in the paper only show the relative usage of the surrogate vs original evaluation. What absolute speedups does this method provide over standard MCTS?

8. For problems with very expensive main evaluations, is it better to use a weaker surrogate model that allows more re-evaluations in the same time budget? 

9. The re-evaluation step currently triggers based on all children being equally visited. Could other heuristic criteria based on value bounds or visit counts lead to better performance?

10. The paper uses a fixed computational budget. Could this method also be applied in anytime algorithms that converge to better solutions given more time? Would the surrogate ratio change over time?
