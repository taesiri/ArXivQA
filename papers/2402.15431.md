# [Designing Multispecies Worlds for Robots, Cats, and Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As robots become more prevalent in everyday environments, they will inevitably encounter and interact with animals, including pets in homes. However, little is known about how to design robots specifically for animal interaction and enrichment. The paper explores this issue through an art project called "Cat Royale". 

Proposed Solution:
Cat Royale involved creating a bespoke "robot world" centered around an enclosure inhabited by 3 cats and a robot arm over 12 days. The goal was to have the robot entertain the cats through various games and toys while ensuring their safety and wellbeing. The artists designed the enclosure, toys, robot motions, supporting technologies like computer vision, etc. A team of humans also played key oversight roles during the project.

The paper reflects on the challenges, solutions and insights from designing and operating Cat Royale. It argues that for robots to successfully and safely interact with animals, two key issues must be addressed - designing an appropriate surrounding world/environment for the robot beyond just the robot itself, and supporting necessary human roles in the interaction loop e.g. for animal welfare, system recovery, entertainment.

Main Contributions:

1) Demonstrating the feasibility of an autonomous robot safely entertaining and engaging with cats over an extended period of time.

2) Highlighting the importance of holistic "world design" for robots that interact with animals, considering factors like safe spaces, storage, decoration, services etc.

3) Revealing various necessary human roles even in autonomous animal-robot interaction e.g. oversight for welfare, breakdown recovery, spectating and cleaning up.

4) Providing guiding principles and insights into key facets like environment design, human involvement, animal welfare for future research into developing domestic robots for animals.

In summary, the paper explores the open challenge of animal-robot interaction through an innovative art project, and provides practical insights into enabling safe, sustained and entertaining engagement between robots and animals in shared environments.
