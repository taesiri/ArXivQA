# [Boosting Multi-modal Model Performance with Adaptive Gradient Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07686)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can one improve the performance of multi-modal deep learning models by modulating the training process to better balance and integrate information from different modalities?Specifically, the paper proposes an "adaptive gradient modulation" method that adjusts the gradient signals for each modality during training to encourage the model to rely more on informative modalities and mitigate "modality competition". The key ideas are:1) Use a Shapley value attribution method to isolate the responses/contributions of each modality. 2) Compute mono-modal cross-entropy for each modality to quantify the amount of information it provides.3) Modulate the gradient updates for each modality based on the discrepancy between its information level (cross-entropy) and a running average reference. This balances the modalities.4) Introduce a "mono-modal concept" to represent the competition-free ideal state of each modality. Use this to define a metric that quantifies the "competition strength" of modalities.5) Evaluate the method on various datasets and models. Show it improves performance and encourages reliance on more informative modalities by reducing their competition strength.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modulating modalities' gradient updates based on their information levels can improve multi-modal learning by mitigating modality competition. The method and competition strength metric are proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Proposing an adaptive gradient modulation (AGM) method that can boost the performance of multi-modal models with various fusion strategies. The key idea is to modulate the gradients for each modality during training based on estimates of the informativeness of each modality.2. Introducing a "mono-modal concept" to capture the competition-free state of each modality, and using this to define a metric for quantifying the strength of competition between modalities. 3. Conducting experiments across different datasets, fusion strategies and network architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of AGM. The results also provide insights into the behavior of modality competition and the mechanism behind how AGM improves performance.In summary, the key contributions are an adaptive training method to improve multi-modal learning, a new metric to analyze modality competition, and an empirical investigation of these ideas on various tasks. The proposed AGM method seems generalizable across different settings, while the competition metric provides a way to quantitatively understand modality interactions.
