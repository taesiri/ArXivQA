# [Implicit Image-to-Image Schrodinger Bridge for CT Super-Resolution and   Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Conditional diffusion models have shown promise for image restoration tasks like denoising and super-resolution. However, they suffer from slow inference due to the large number of iterative denoising steps required, starting from pure Gaussian noise. The Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I2SB) initializes the process from corrupted images to reduce steps, but still produces overly smooth images using a small number of steps. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose the Implicit Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I3SB) which incorporates the corrupted image at each step of the generative process, making it non-Markovian. This allows better texture restoration with fewer steps. 

Key Details:
- I3SB preserves the I2SB training process but modifies the generative process to condition each step on the corrupted image besides just the previous step's image.
- A parameter gn balances between I2SB and I3SB components and can be adjusted across steps.
- Validation on 4x super-resolution of chest CT and denoising of quarter-dose abdominal CT shows I3SB recovers more texture details than I2SB and conditional DDPM with similar fidelity.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of I3SB extending I2SB generative process to non-Markovian by incorporating corrupted image at each step
- Flexible gn parameter to balance Markovian and non-Markovian components across steps
- Demonstrated improved texture restoration over I2SB and cDDPM in CT super-resolution and denoising tasks
- Further refinement of gn as a learned function is pointed out as future work

In summary, the paper proposes I3SB to enhance I2SB for medical image restoration by making the generative process non-Markovian. Comparative experiments validate improved texture recovery of I3SB over state-of-the-art methods.
