# [Infusing Hierarchical Guidance into Prompt Tuning: A Parameter-Efficient   Framework for Multi-level Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15080)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) aims to identify relations between text arguments without explicit connectives. It is challenging due to lack of sufficient annotated data and the complexity of modeling hierarchical relation semantics.
- Existing methods fine-tune PLMs but often aggravate collapse of pre-trained feature space due to task gap and data scarcity. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a parameter-efficient multi-level IDRR (PEMI) framework to address the problems.

- It leverages parameter-efficient prompt tuning (PEPT) to drive input arguments to match pre-trained feature space using few additional parameters. This allows approximation without collapsing original space.

- A novel hierarchical label refining (HLR) method is proposed to incorporate hierarchical guidance into prompt verbalizer. It recursively aggregates semantics from fine-grained labels to generate verbalizer without added parameters.

- Joint learning of all levels is conducted to combine intra-level discrimination and inter-level hierarchical information.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply PEPT for IDRR task to alleviate data scarcity from a parameter perspective.
- Proposal of PEMI framework that deeply integrates hierarchical label information into prompt tuning to guide multi-level relation modeling. 
- HLR method that transfers hierarchical knowledge into verbalizer with no extra parameters.
- Comparable performance to state-of-the-art with only 0.1% trainable parameters on PDTB 2.0 and 3.0.

In summary, the paper presents a parameter-efficient framework to effectively inject hierarchical guidance into prompt tuning for multi-level IDRR task. The core innovation is the hierarchical label refining approach.
