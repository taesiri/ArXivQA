# [How Far Can Camels Go? Exploring the State of Instruction Tuning on Open   Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04751)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How do different open instruction tuning datasets and models compare in improving language models' capabilities on a diverse set of benchmark tests and open-ended instruction following? 

Specifically, the paper systematically compares the performance of various open instruction tuning datasets (e.g. Dolly, FLAN, Alpaca) and models of different sizes (7B to 65B parameters) on benchmarks testing skills like reasoning, factuality, coding, and multilinguality. It also evaluates their open-ended instruction following abilities through model-based (GPT-4) and human evaluations. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that while different datasets may excel at improving certain specialized skills, combining multiple datasets together into a mixture model like TÃ¼lu should lead to the best overall performance across diverse evaluation metrics. The paper aims to rigorously test this hypothesis through comprehensive experiments across datasets, model sizes, and evaluation settings. The goal is to provide guidance on how to develop better open instruction-tuned models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. Provides a comprehensive evaluation of a wide variety of publicly-available instruction-tuning datasets and models, ranging from 6.7B to 65B parameters. The authors systematically evaluate their capabilities on factual knowledge, reasoning, multilinguality, coding, and open-ended instruction following through automatic metrics, model-based evaluation, and human evaluation.

2. Shows that different instruction datasets promote different capabilities, with no single dataset providing the best performance across the board. Combining multiple datasets results in better overall performance on average.

3. Demonstrates that the quality of the base model is extremely important, with better pretrained models like LLaMa consistently outperforming comparable models after instruction tuning.

4. Introduces Tulu, a suite of instruction-tuned LLaMa models trained on combinations of datasets, with Tulu 65B being a 65B LLaMa model finetuned on a diverse mix of data. Tulu provides strong performance across tasks, although still lags behind proprietary models like ChatGPT.

5. Finds that model and human preference evaluations may not fully reflect differences in model capabilities, as they strongly correlate with length/diversity of generations. The authors argue for the need for systematic, multifaceted evaluation performed in this work.

6. Provides insights on the limits of existing open models and datasets, while releasing code, data, models like Tulu to facilitate future research in improving instruction-tuned models.

In summary, this paper provides the most comprehensive evaluation of open instruction tuning resources to date, highlights their strengths and weaknesses, and introduces models and resources to further advance research in this direction. The key insight is that while progress has been made, there is still significant room for improving both base models and instruction datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available instruction tuning datasets and models ranging from 6.7B to 65B parameters, finding that model scale, base model quality, and diversity of tuning data are key factors determining performance across evaluations of knowledge, reasoning, multilinguality, coding, and open-ended instruction following ability, with their proposed LLaMa model fine-tuned on a mix of datasets achieving strong but still subpar performance compared to proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on instruction tuning of large language models:

- Scope of evaluation: This paper provides one of the most comprehensive evaluations of instruction tuning approaches and datasets to date. It evaluates models systematically across a diverse set of tasks and skills including reasoning, factuality, coding, multilinguality, and open-ended instruction following. Many prior works have focused evaluation on only a subset of these areas. The scale of the evaluation helps give a broader view of model capabilities.

- Diversity of models and datasets: The paper explores an extensive set of 12 instruction datasets, spanning human-authored, synthesized, and distilled sources. It also explores base models ranging from 6.7B to 65B parameters, allowing analysis of how model scale interacts with instruction data. Many prior works have studied a smaller subset of datasets or model sizes.

- Combining instruction datasets: The paper introduces the \modelname \modellogo model trained on a mixture of instruction datasets. Evaluating mixtures helps show the value of combining diverse data. Prior work has mostly studied datasets in isolation or only combined a few sources.

- Analysis of evaluation methods: The paper uses benchmark evaluations, model-based evaluations, and human evaluations to provide different perspectives. It highlights issues with relying solely on model-based evaluations, a common practice in prior work. The multiple evaluation views are a methodological advance.

- Openness: The paper open sources code, models, and data to facilitate reproducibility and future research. Many recent instruction tuning papers do not release artifacts publicly.

Overall, the scale and rigor of the evaluation, along with analyses of model size, data combining, and evaluation methodology make this paper a significant contribution compared to prior work on instruction tuning of large language models. The releases also provide useful resources for the community to build upon.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reading the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing better base models and instruction-tuning data: The authors find that larger, higher quality base models like LLaMa perform better after instruction tuning across the board. They suggest continued work on developing strong base models and broad, diverse instruction tuning datasets is needed.

- Exploring better mixtures and modular models: The authors find that combining multiple datasets leads to good overall performance, but can cause slight drops in some specialized skills. They suggest exploring better ways to mix datasets, such as more complex sampling methods, as well as modular models like mixture-of-experts.

- Improving reliability and scalability of human evaluations: The authors find human evaluation important but note there is subjectivity and noise. They suggest improving reliability through better annotation protocols and interfaces, and scaling up the number of examples annotated.

- Testing new instruction datasets and models: While the authors covered a broad set, they note evaluating all recent datasets and models is infeasible. They suggest testing if newer datasets or models like Falcon yield significant improvements.

- Exploring reinforcement learning based instruction tuning: The authors focus on supervised finetuning but note RL-based tuning is another promising direction.

- Releasing models in a responsible, gated manner: The authors recommend carefully testing and incrementally releasing very large instruction-tuned models to limit potential harms.

In summary, the key suggestions are to continue developing better base models, instruction data, evaluation techniques, and release frameworks to advance open instruction-tuned models. The authors provide empirical analysis and open resources to support progress in these areas.
