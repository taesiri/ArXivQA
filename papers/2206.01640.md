# [PROMISSING: Pruning Missing Values in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01640)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop neural network models that are able to handle incomplete data with missing values, without needing to perform imputation? 

The key points are:

- Missing data are very common in real-world datasets, but standard neural networks cannot handle missing values directly. Typically imputation is used, but this has limitations.

- The authors propose a new method called PROMISSING that allows neural networks to handle missing values by learning a problem-specific numerical representation for unknowns. 

- With PROMISSING, missing values are treated as a new source of information rather than being imputed. The model becomes less decisive in its predictions when facing more unknowns.

- Experiments on simulated and real datasets show PROMISSING performs competitively compared to various imputation techniques for classification and regression tasks.

- On a clinical dataset, PROMISSING allows the model to say "I don't know" when facing incomplete patient data, an important feature for trustworthy medical decision making.

So in summary, the key research question is how to develop neural network models that can handle missing data directly, without needing imputation, using the unknowns themselves as a source of information. PROMISSING is proposed as a novel technique for achieving this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing PROMISSING, a simple and effective method for handling missing values in neural networks. Unlike imputation-based approaches, PROMISSING does not replace missing values but instead learns a representation for unknowns. Key features of PROMISSING summarized from the paper:

- It neutralizes the effect of missing values on neuron activations by "pruning" them. Missing values are replaced with adaptive "neutralizers" that depend on the weights and biases. 

- It is very simple and intuitive. There is no need to change the network architecture or training process. 

- Experiments show it performs on par with various imputation techniques on classification and regression tasks, while being more flexible to different missing data patterns.

- It allows models to become more indecisive when facing many unknowns, an appealing property for reliable decision making.  

- It facilitates counterfactual interpretation to explain model predictions by treating unknowns as counterfactuals.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an elegant and easy-to-use method to handle missing values in neural networks without imputation. Key advantages are simplicity, reliability, and the ability to represent unknowns.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet effective method called PROMISSING for handling missing values in neural networks without imputation by learning to represent and prune missing values during training and inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on handling missing data in neural networks:

- Overall approach: The proposed PROMISSING technique takes a unique approach of directly modeling missing values rather than imputing them. Most other methods focus on imputation or removing samples/features with missing data. Modeling missing values directly is an interesting alternative.

- Simplicity: PROMISSING modifies only the first layer of a neural network, keeping the rest of the architecture unchanged. This simplicity contrasts with some other methods that require modifying the network architecture more substantially. However, the tradeoff is PROMISSING may not model complex missing data patterns as effectively.

- Flexibility: A key advantage of PROMISSING is it can handle any data type as input, including continuous, binary, categorical, etc. Many imputation methods are limited to only continuous data. This flexibility allows PROMISSING to be applied easily to diverse real-world datasets.

- Assumptions: PROMISSING does not make explicit assumptions about the missing data mechanism (MCAR, MAR, etc). In comparison, some methods like MICE assume MAR and probabilistic methods often assume MCAR or MAR. PROMISSING's assumption-free approach could be more robust.

- Performance: The experiments show PROMISSING competes well with imputation methods, especially on MNAR data. Some other modeling-based methods like GMMs do not scale as well to large/high-dimensional datasets.

- Uncertainty: An interesting qualitative result is how PROMISSING models become more uncertain with more missing inputs. Most imputation methods always yield a prediction. Capturing uncertainty is useful for domains like healthcare where unsure predictions are important.

In summary, PROMISSING offers a simple yet flexible approach for directly modeling missing values in neural networks. The key advantages seem to be its simplicity, flexibility, and natural uncertainty estimates. The tradeoffs are potentially less robustness for complex missing patterns and undershooting activations for high missing data ratios.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring the connection between modeling unknowns and model uncertainty. The authors mention that it is worth investigating how representing missing values as unknowns relates to estimating model uncertainty.

- Empirical comparison with model-based incomplete data modeling approaches. The authors suggest comparing PROMISSING empirically to existing probabilistic and model-based methods for handling incomplete data without imputation.

- Applications on more complex and structured data. The authors suggest applying PROMISSING to more complex data types beyond the tabular data used in their experiments, such as images, text, and graph data.

- Analytical analysis of the effect of missing values. The authors suggest further theoretical analysis on how missing values and their representations impact model optimization and generalization.

- Extensions to other types of neural network architectures. The current implementation of PROMISSING focuses on standard dense neural networks. The authors suggest exploring its application to other architectures like convolutional neural networks.

- Applications in more domains. The authors suggest applying PROMISSING in more application domains beyond the clinical application presented in the paper, especially other domains where missing data are common.

In summary, the main future directions are: further theoretical and empirical analysis of PROMISSING, extensions to other data types and neural network architectures, comparisons to other missing data methods, and novel applications in domains with lots of missing data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes PROMISSING, a simple yet effective method for handling missing values in neural networks without needing to impute the data. PROMISSING works by replacing missing values with “neutralizers” that prune the effect of the missing values on a neuron's activation. Missing values are treated as a source of information representing the unknown, rather than being replaced through imputation. Experiments on simulated and real-world data show PROMISSING performs comparably to various imputation techniques for classification and regression tasks. A key advantage is that models trained with PROMISSING become more indecisive when more input values are missing, avoiding unwarranted confidence in predictions when data is highly incomplete. This is promising for applications like healthcare where machine learning models should indicate when predictions are unreliable due to missing inputs. Overall, PROMISSING advances neural networks to handle missing data seamlessly without imputation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here are two paragraphs summarizing the main points of the paper:

This paper proposes PROMISSING, a novel method for dealing with missing values in neural networks without data imputation. PROMISSING replaces missing values with "neutralizers" that prune the effect of missing inputs on neuron activations. The neutralizers are computed on-the-fly during training and inference using the weights and biases of the neurons. Experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets show that PROMISSING performs similarly to multiple imputation techniques. A key advantage of PROMISSING is that the model becomes more uncertain in its predictions when there are more missing values, unlike models trained on imputed data. This is a desirable property, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare. The paper demonstrates a clinical use case of PROMISSING on a multi-modal psychosis prognosis dataset. PROMISSING provides similar predictive performance to K-nearest neighbor imputation and enables counterfactual explanation of the model's predictions.

PROMISSING provides a simple plug-and-play method to handle missing values in neural networks without imputation. The learned neutralizer representations prune the effect of missing inputs while retaining uncertainty when data are incomplete. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance to imputation and intuitive model behavior. PROMISSING is computationally efficient and appropriate for multi-modal and mixed-type data. It could enable more reliable adoption of neural networks in domains where imperfect data are common, like healthcare. Counterfactual explanation using PROMISSING may increase model interpretability and trust. Overall, PROMISSING offers a novel perspective on missing values: rather than fills gaps, treat unknowns as useful information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes PROMISSING, a method for handling missing values in neural networks without imputing the data. In PROMISSING, missing values are replaced with learned "neutralizers" that prune the effect of missing inputs on each neuron's activation. Specifically, a missing input value for neuron k is replaced with u_j^{(k)} = -b^{(k)}/(pw^{(k)}_j), where b^{(k)} is the neuron's bias, w^{(k)}_j is its weight for that input, and p is the total number of inputs. This cancels out the contribution of the missing input to the neuron's weighted sum. PROMISSING learns a problem-specific numerical representation for unknowns rather than using imputation. Theoretically, it is shown that PROMISSING neurons become completely inactive when all inputs are missing, and behave normally when no inputs are missing. Experiments on simulated and real-world classification/regression datasets demonstrate that PROMISSING achieves comparable accuracy to imputation methods. An application to clinical data illustrates how PROMISSING models become more indecisive as information is missing, an important property for reliable decision making. Overall, PROMISSING provides a simple and effective approach for neural networks to handle missing values without explicit imputation.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes PROMISSING, a novel method for pruning missing values in neural networks without the need for imputation. The key idea is to replace missing values with neutralizers that prune the effect of missing inputs on neuron activations. Neutralizers are computed on-the-fly as the negative ratio of neuron bias to weights, effectively cancelling out the impact of missing inputs. An extension called mPROMISSING uses a learned compensatory weight to handle cases with many missing values. Experiments on simulated and benchmark data show PROMISSING performs competitively with imputation methods across MCAR, MAR and MNAR data, while yielding more calibrated uncertainty in predictions. A clinical application demonstrates PROMISSING's utility in multimodal fusion and counterfactual explanations for psychosis prognosis. Overall, PROMISSING advances neural networks to become less reliant on imputation when handling missing data. Its simple implementation enables unknowns to remain unknown during learning, leading to more honest models that recognize the limits of their knowledge.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called PROMISSING for handling missing data in neural networks without needing to impute the missing values. The key idea is to replace missing values with "neutralizers" that cancel out the effect of the missing inputs on the neural network activations. This allows the network to still operate properly and learn representations even with incomplete data, without replacing missing values with potentially biased imputed values. Experiments on simulated and real-world classification/regression datasets demonstrate that PROMISSING performs competitively with various imputation techniques. A notable advantage is that models trained with PROMISSING become more uncertain in their predictions when given samples with many missing values, unlike models trained on imputed data. This is desirable in applications like healthcare where machine learning models should acknowledge "I do not know" when inputs are very incomplete. An application of PROMISSING is shown on a clinical dataset for psychosis prognosis prediction. Overall, PROMISSING offers a simple and intuitive way to handle missing data in neural networks without imputation.
