# [PROMISSING: Pruning Missing Values in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01640)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop neural network models that are able to handle incomplete data with missing values, without needing to perform imputation? 

The key points are:

- Missing data are very common in real-world datasets, but standard neural networks cannot handle missing values directly. Typically imputation is used, but this has limitations.

- The authors propose a new method called PROMISSING that allows neural networks to handle missing values by learning a problem-specific numerical representation for unknowns. 

- With PROMISSING, missing values are treated as a new source of information rather than being imputed. The model becomes less decisive in its predictions when facing more unknowns.

- Experiments on simulated and real datasets show PROMISSING performs competitively compared to various imputation techniques for classification and regression tasks.

- On a clinical dataset, PROMISSING allows the model to say "I don't know" when facing incomplete patient data, an important feature for trustworthy medical decision making.

So in summary, the key research question is how to develop neural network models that can handle missing data directly, without needing imputation, using the unknowns themselves as a source of information. PROMISSING is proposed as a novel technique for achieving this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing PROMISSING, a simple and effective method for handling missing values in neural networks. Unlike imputation-based approaches, PROMISSING does not replace missing values but instead learns a representation for unknowns. Key features of PROMISSING summarized from the paper:

- It neutralizes the effect of missing values on neuron activations by "pruning" them. Missing values are replaced with adaptive "neutralizers" that depend on the weights and biases. 

- It is very simple and intuitive. There is no need to change the network architecture or training process. 

- Experiments show it performs on par with various imputation techniques on classification and regression tasks, while being more flexible to different missing data patterns.

- It allows models to become more indecisive when facing many unknowns, an appealing property for reliable decision making.  

- It facilitates counterfactual interpretation to explain model predictions by treating unknowns as counterfactuals.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an elegant and easy-to-use method to handle missing values in neural networks without imputation. Key advantages are simplicity, reliability, and the ability to represent unknowns.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet effective method called PROMISSING for handling missing values in neural networks without imputation by learning to represent and prune missing values during training and inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on handling missing data in neural networks:

- Overall approach: The proposed PROMISSING technique takes a unique approach of directly modeling missing values rather than imputing them. Most other methods focus on imputation or removing samples/features with missing data. Modeling missing values directly is an interesting alternative.

- Simplicity: PROMISSING modifies only the first layer of a neural network, keeping the rest of the architecture unchanged. This simplicity contrasts with some other methods that require modifying the network architecture more substantially. However, the tradeoff is PROMISSING may not model complex missing data patterns as effectively.

- Flexibility: A key advantage of PROMISSING is it can handle any data type as input, including continuous, binary, categorical, etc. Many imputation methods are limited to only continuous data. This flexibility allows PROMISSING to be applied easily to diverse real-world datasets.

- Assumptions: PROMISSING does not make explicit assumptions about the missing data mechanism (MCAR, MAR, etc). In comparison, some methods like MICE assume MAR and probabilistic methods often assume MCAR or MAR. PROMISSING's assumption-free approach could be more robust.

- Performance: The experiments show PROMISSING competes well with imputation methods, especially on MNAR data. Some other modeling-based methods like GMMs do not scale as well to large/high-dimensional datasets.

- Uncertainty: An interesting qualitative result is how PROMISSING models become more uncertain with more missing inputs. Most imputation methods always yield a prediction. Capturing uncertainty is useful for domains like healthcare where unsure predictions are important.

In summary, PROMISSING offers a simple yet flexible approach for directly modeling missing values in neural networks. The key advantages seem to be its simplicity, flexibility, and natural uncertainty estimates. The tradeoffs are potentially less robustness for complex missing patterns and undershooting activations for high missing data ratios.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring the connection between modeling unknowns and model uncertainty. The authors mention that it is worth investigating how representing missing values as unknowns relates to estimating model uncertainty.

- Empirical comparison with model-based incomplete data modeling approaches. The authors suggest comparing PROMISSING empirically to existing probabilistic and model-based methods for handling incomplete data without imputation.

- Applications on more complex and structured data. The authors suggest applying PROMISSING to more complex data types beyond the tabular data used in their experiments, such as images, text, and graph data.

- Analytical analysis of the effect of missing values. The authors suggest further theoretical analysis on how missing values and their representations impact model optimization and generalization.

- Extensions to other types of neural network architectures. The current implementation of PROMISSING focuses on standard dense neural networks. The authors suggest exploring its application to other architectures like convolutional neural networks.

- Applications in more domains. The authors suggest applying PROMISSING in more application domains beyond the clinical application presented in the paper, especially other domains where missing data are common.

In summary, the main future directions are: further theoretical and empirical analysis of PROMISSING, extensions to other data types and neural network architectures, comparisons to other missing data methods, and novel applications in domains with lots of missing data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes PROMISSING, a simple yet effective method for handling missing values in neural networks without needing to impute the data. PROMISSING works by replacing missing values with “neutralizers” that prune the effect of the missing values on a neuron's activation. Missing values are treated as a source of information representing the unknown, rather than being replaced through imputation. Experiments on simulated and real-world data show PROMISSING performs comparably to various imputation techniques for classification and regression tasks. A key advantage is that models trained with PROMISSING become more indecisive when more input values are missing, avoiding unwarranted confidence in predictions when data is highly incomplete. This is promising for applications like healthcare where machine learning models should indicate when predictions are unreliable due to missing inputs. Overall, PROMISSING advances neural networks to handle missing data seamlessly without imputation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here are two paragraphs summarizing the main points of the paper:

This paper proposes PROMISSING, a novel method for dealing with missing values in neural networks without data imputation. PROMISSING replaces missing values with "neutralizers" that prune the effect of missing inputs on neuron activations. The neutralizers are computed on-the-fly during training and inference using the weights and biases of the neurons. Experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets show that PROMISSING performs similarly to multiple imputation techniques. A key advantage of PROMISSING is that the model becomes more uncertain in its predictions when there are more missing values, unlike models trained on imputed data. This is a desirable property, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare. The paper demonstrates a clinical use case of PROMISSING on a multi-modal psychosis prognosis dataset. PROMISSING provides similar predictive performance to K-nearest neighbor imputation and enables counterfactual explanation of the model's predictions.

PROMISSING provides a simple plug-and-play method to handle missing values in neural networks without imputation. The learned neutralizer representations prune the effect of missing inputs while retaining uncertainty when data are incomplete. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance to imputation and intuitive model behavior. PROMISSING is computationally efficient and appropriate for multi-modal and mixed-type data. It could enable more reliable adoption of neural networks in domains where imperfect data are common, like healthcare. Counterfactual explanation using PROMISSING may increase model interpretability and trust. Overall, PROMISSING offers a novel perspective on missing values: rather than fills gaps, treat unknowns as useful information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes PROMISSING, a method for handling missing values in neural networks without imputing the data. In PROMISSING, missing values are replaced with learned "neutralizers" that prune the effect of missing inputs on each neuron's activation. Specifically, a missing input value for neuron k is replaced with u_j^{(k)} = -b^{(k)}/(pw^{(k)}_j), where b^{(k)} is the neuron's bias, w^{(k)}_j is its weight for that input, and p is the total number of inputs. This cancels out the contribution of the missing input to the neuron's weighted sum. PROMISSING learns a problem-specific numerical representation for unknowns rather than using imputation. Theoretically, it is shown that PROMISSING neurons become completely inactive when all inputs are missing, and behave normally when no inputs are missing. Experiments on simulated and real-world classification/regression datasets demonstrate that PROMISSING achieves comparable accuracy to imputation methods. An application to clinical data illustrates how PROMISSING models become more indecisive as information is missing, an important property for reliable decision making. Overall, PROMISSING provides a simple and effective approach for neural networks to handle missing values without explicit imputation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of handling missing data in neural network models. Specifically, it proposes a new method called PROMISSING for pruning missing values in neural networks during learning and inference. The key questions it aims to address are:

- How can neural networks deal with missing data directly without imputing/filling in the missing values?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes PROMISSING, a novel method for pruning missing values in neural networks without the need for imputation. The key idea is to replace missing values with neutralizers that prune the effect of missing inputs on neuron activations. Neutralizers are computed on-the-fly as the negative ratio of neuron bias to weights, effectively cancelling out the impact of missing inputs. An extension called mPROMISSING uses a learned compensatory weight to handle cases with many missing values. Experiments on simulated and benchmark data show PROMISSING performs competitively with imputation methods across MCAR, MAR and MNAR data, while yielding more calibrated uncertainty in predictions. A clinical application demonstrates PROMISSING's utility in multimodal fusion and counterfactual explanations for psychosis prognosis. Overall, PROMISSING advances neural networks to become less reliant on imputation when handling missing data. Its simple implementation enables unknowns to remain unknown during learning, leading to more honest models that recognize the limits of their knowledge.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called PROMISSING for handling missing data in neural networks without needing to impute the missing values. The key idea is to replace missing values with "neutralizers" that cancel out the effect of the missing inputs on the neural network activations. This allows the network to still operate properly and learn representations even with incomplete data, without replacing missing values with potentially biased imputed values. Experiments on simulated and real-world classification/regression datasets demonstrate that PROMISSING performs competitively with various imputation techniques. A notable advantage is that models trained with PROMISSING become more uncertain in their predictions when given samples with many missing values, unlike models trained on imputed data. This is desirable in applications like healthcare where machine learning models should acknowledge "I do not know" when inputs are very incomplete. An application of PROMISSING is shown on a clinical dataset for psychosis prognosis prediction. Overall, PROMISSING offers a simple and intuitive way to handle missing data in neural networks without imputation.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: What is the theoretical framework and optimization properties of inference learning (IL) algorithms, and how do they compare to backpropagation? 

The authors develop a novel theoretical analysis of IL algorithms, which are learning methods often proposed as more biologically plausible alternatives to backpropagation. Their main goals seem to be:

1) To show IL algorithms closely approximate a proper optimization method called implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD), which is distinct from explicit SGD used in backpropagation. 

2) Analyze the differences between IL and backpropagation in terms of optimization properties like stability.

3) Provide theoretical justification for why IL is able to perform competitively with backpropagation on supervised learning tasks, despite the algorithms being quite different.

4) Develop a theoretical understanding of the advantages of IL over backpropagation, especially in more biologically realistic training scenarios (e.g. with small mini-batches).

So in summary, the central research question is focused on developing a formal theoretical framework to understand the optimization properties and behavior of IL algorithms, especially in relation to backpropagation. This theory aims to provide new insights into the mechanics of IL and its potential as a biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- It identifies the variable settings and learning rules needed for IL to match implicit SGD, and uses this to develop a new IL algorithm called IL-prox that better approximates implicit SGD.

- It provides theoretical results on the stability of IL compared to backpropagation. The results show IL is more stable across learning rates due to differences in how the algorithms compute and utilize local targets.

- It presents extensive simulation results that provide empirical support for the theoretical interpretations and show some performance advantages of IL over backpropagation. Key advantages are improved stability across learning rates and faster convergence when using small mini-batches.

In summary, the main contribution is the new theoretical framework that interprets IL as an approximation of implicit SGD. This framework provides mathematical justification for IL, helps explain its competitive performance, and is used to develop a improved IL algorithm as well as gain insights into its advantages over backpropagation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper develops a novel theoretical framework to analyze the optimization properties of inference learning (IL) algorithms. This provides new mathematical insights into why IL can match the performance of backpropagation, despite being more biologically plausible. Other works have studied the biological plausibility of IL, but this paper provides more rigorous mathematical grounding.

- The paper shows IL approximates an optimization method called implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD). This connects IL to the broader framework of optimization theory and implicit SGD. Other works like Qiao et al. 2021 have also connected IL to optimization concepts like proximal operators, but this paper makes a more direct connection to implicit SGD. 

- The paper identifies specific settings where IL approximates implicit SGD, which prior theoretical analyses did not do. The paper also proposes a novel IL algorithm (IL-prox) designed to better match implicit SGD. This provides concrete guidance for implementing IL to match a proper optimization algorithm.

- The paper analyzes the stability of IL compared to backpropagation algorithms, proving formal results on when IL will stably minimize loss. Other theoretical works have not analyzed the stability of IL in this way. This provides new insights into the advantages of IL.

- The empirical results provide novel evidence that IL can outperform backpropagation in certain scenarios, like training with small mini-batches. Most prior empirical studies focused on large mini-batch training.

Overall, this paper makes significant theoretical and empirical contributions to the study of biologically plausible learning algorithms like IL. It offers new mathematical grounding, optimization-theory based analysis, and evidence of advantages over backpropagation. The connections to implicit SGD and stability analysis appear novel compared to prior IL research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Further study the optimization properties of IL with mini-batches to improve its performance on machine learning tasks where mini-batches are typically used. The authors' analysis focused on the case of training with single data points, but training with mini-batches is more common in deep learning.

- Explore alternative learning rules for IL that better approximate the solution to the local error minimization problem in the case of mini-batch size > 1. The authors show the normalized LMS rule used by IL is suboptimal for mini-batches.

- Analyze differences in the behavior of IL for small versus large mini-batches to gain more insight into cases where IL does not match the performance of backpropagation.

- Build on the stability guarantees provided for the output layer activities in IL networks to try to ensure stability across the whole network. The authors show IL stably minimizes the loss along the minimum norm path at the output layer, but further work could try to extend this stability property.

- Leverage the mathematical interpretation of IL as an implicit gradient method, along with its advantages like stability, to develop improved biologically constrained learning algorithms. This could lead to advances in areas like neuromorphic computing.

- Explore how the implicit gradient nature of IL might relate to optimization and credit assignment in biological neural networks, since implicit gradient methods seem more compatible with constraints on biological learning.

In summary, the main future directions focus on better understanding IL in the context of mini-batches, further improving its stability and optimization properties, and building on the implicit gradient interpretation to advance theories of learning in both machine and biological neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper develops a theoretical framework for inference learning (IL), an algorithm that has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. The main contributions are:

1. The authors derive a general form of IL called Generalized IL (G-IL) and show it approximates an optimization method known as implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD). Implicit SGD is distinct from explicit SGD used in backpropagation. 

2. They show G-IL can be altered to better match implicit SGD, leading to a novel variant called IL-prox. IL-prox improves stability across learning rates, consistent with implicit SGD's stability properties.

3. They analyze the stability of IL versus backpropagation algorithms theoretically and empirically. Their analysis suggests the way IL computes and utilizes local targets contributes to its stability relative to backpropagation.

4. Through simulations, they demonstrate for the first time IL can achieve faster convergence than backpropagation when trained on biologically realistic, small mini-batches.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper develops a novel theoretical framework for the inference learning (IL) algorithm. IL is an energy-based learning method that has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. The main result of this paper is that IL closely approximates an optimization method known as implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD). Implicit SGD is distinct from the explicit SGD implemented by backpropagation. The authors show how the standard implementation of IL can be altered to better approximate implicit SGD, leading to improved stability across learning rates. They provide theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results to demonstrate that IL achieves quicker convergence when trained with small mini-batches, while matching backpropagation's performance for large mini-batches. 

The authors first present a general form of the IL algorithm and show it is equivalent to implicit SGD under certain conditions. They analyze the stability properties of IL compared to backpropagation, finding IL avoids interference between weight updates. Theoretical results demonstrate IL updates ensure output layer activities change in the desired direction, unlike backpropagation which only has this property for a small range of learning rates. Based on the theory, the authors develop a novel IL algorithm called IL-prox that better approximates implicit SGD. Simulations show IL-prox has improved stability across learning rates. Additional experiments demonstrate advantages of IL over backpropagation, including faster convergence for small mini-batches and more direct minimization of the loss. Overall, the theoretical framework and results suggest IL is a promising approach for biologically realistic optimization that can match or exceed backpropagation's performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper develops a theoretical framework and novel implementation for inference learning (IL), an algorithm that can be used to train deep neural networks. The main theoretical result is that IL closely approximates an optimization method known as implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD), which is different from the explicit SGD used by backpropagation. The authors show that by minimizing a free energy function, IL is able to compute approximate implicit gradients and parameter updates. They derive the settings of variables like the learning rate and weighting terms needed for IL to equal implicit SGD. Based on this analysis, they propose a new implementation called IL-prox that better approximates implicit SGD. IL-prox uses a normalized gradient learning rule and alters how the learning rate is utilized. Through simulations, the authors find IL-prox has improved stability across learning rates compared to standard IL algorithms. They also find IL-prox and standard IL converge faster than backpropagation when trained on streaming data with small mini-batches, which is argued to be a more biologically realistic scenario.

This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding the optimization properties of the inference learning (IL) algorithm. IL is proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation (BP) that matches BP's performance in many tasks. The authors show IL closely approximates an optimization method called implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD), which is distinct from the explicit SGD implemented by BP. A general form of IL (G-IL) is presented, and it is proven G-IL is increasingly similar to an algorithm called proximal IL (IL-prox) that explicitly minimizes the proximal loss function associated with implicit SGD. Further analysis demonstrates IL-prox and G-IL are equivalent to performing an implicit SGD update, and thus IL algorithms perform approximate implicit optimization. Additional theoretical results are presented concerning the stability of IL versus BP, suggesting the learning rules and mechanisms for computing local targets in IL confer greater stability than analogous mechanisms in BP. Extensive simulations provide evidence supporting the theoretical interpretations. Notably, IL is shown to achieve quicker optimization than BP when trained on streaming data with small mini-batches, which fits with the proposed interpretation IL performs implicit optimization. Overall, the results provide mathematical justification for IL, demonstrate key differences between IL and BP, and suggest IL is well-suited for biologically constrained and streaming data scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a theoretical framework for inference learning, an algorithm that has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for training deep neural networks. The main result is that inference learning closely approximates an optimization method called implicit stochastic gradient descent, which differs from the explicit gradient descent used in backpropagation. This theoretical interpretation helps explain the algorithm's stability and performance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops a novel theoretical framework and analysis of the inference learning (IL) algorithm. The authors show that IL closely approximates an optimization method known as implicit stochastic gradient descent (implicit SGD), which is distinct from the explicit SGD implemented by backpropagation. They derive a general form of IL and show that when using the normalized least mean squares learning rule, IL is equivalent to minimizing a proximal loss function with respect to neural activities. Minimizing this proximal loss is equivalent to performing an implicit SGD update. The authors further analyze the stability properties of IL versus backpropagation and show IL avoids problematic interference effects between weight updates that cause instability in backpropagation. They introduce a novel implementation of IL called IL-prox that better approximates implicit SGD. Extensive simulations demonstrate the improved stability of IL across learning rates and its faster convergence compared to backpropagation when trained on streaming data with small mini-batches. These results provide mathematical justification for IL and suggest it may better fit biological constraints than backpropagation while still achieving high performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using inference learning (IL) as a more biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Can you expand more on why IL may be more biologically plausible? What are the key differences from a neuroscience perspective?

2. The paper shows IL approximates a form of implicit stochastic gradient descent. Can you explain in more detail the difference between implicit and explicit stochastic gradient descent and why this connection to implicit SGD is notable for understanding IL?

3. The paper introduces a variant called IL-prox that is designed to better match implicit SGD. What is the motivation behind IL-prox and how does it differ from the standard IL algorithm? 

4. One of the key results is that IL demonstrates better stability across learning rates compared to backpropagation. What mechanisms lead to this improved stability in IL? How does the learning rule used in IL contribute to stability?

5. The paper shows IL takes a more direct path to minimizing loss compared to backpropagation in certain cases. Can you expand on what this means and why it results in faster convergence for IL in some experiments?

6. How does the way IL chains together local prediction problems aid its stability and performance compared to backpropagation? Can you explain the differences in mathematical terms?

7. What are the limitations of the theoretical analysis presented in the paper? When might the connections to implicit SGD break down?

8. The paper focuses on a simplified case of using single data points per update. How well do you expect the results to generalize to mini-batches and why?

9. One experiment shows IL outperforming backprop with small mini-batches. What might this imply about IL as a learning algorithm for biologically plausible systems?

10. The paper links IL to predictive coding theories of cortical computation. What are the broader implications of these results in terms of our understanding of optimization and learning in the brain?
