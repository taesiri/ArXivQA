# [Frame Flexible Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14817)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train a video recognition model that is flexible and efficient in terms of the number of input frames, so that it can adjust its computation and memory costs during inference?The key hypotheses/claims are:- Existing video recognition models exhibit a "Temporal Frequency Deviation" phenomenon, where their performance significantly drops when evaluated with a different number of frames than what they were trained on.- This phenomenon can be addressed by proposing a "Frame Flexible Network" (FFN) framework that trains the model using multiple input sequences with different frame rates. - FFN enables the model to achieve strong performance when evaluated with varying numbers of input frames, while only requiring training once rather than separate training for each frame rate.- FFN reduces memory costs compared to separately trained models for each frame rate.- The core designs of FFN - Multi-Frequency Alignment and Multi-Frequency Adaptation - allow it to learn temporal frequency invariant representations and strengthen sub-network representations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed FFN can train a single efficient and flexible video recognition model, in contrast to standard practices that require separate training for each frame rate. FFN aims to resolve the performance degradation issue when evaluating at mismatched frame rates.
