# [Monte Carlo with kernel-based Gibbs measures: Guarantees for   probabilistic herding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Kernel herding is a deterministic algorithm that seeks to minimize the worst-case integration error over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by greedily minimizing an integral probability metric (IPM).
- Despite strong experimental support for faster convergence, there is no theoretical proof yet that kernel herding converges at a rate faster than the Monte Carlo rate of $n^{-1/2}$ when the RKHS is infinite-dimensional. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper studies a Gibbs probability distribution that favors configurations of $n$ points that minimize the same IPM as kernel herding. 
- By choosing the interaction kernel and external potential suitably, the Gibbs distribution's equilibrium measure can be set to a target distribution $\pi$.
- The paper proves a concentration inequality showing that the Gibbs empirical measure converges to the equilibrium measure at a faster sub-Gaussian rate than Monte Carlo methods.

Main Contributions:
- Proves that a probabilistic relaxation of kernel herding provably outperforms Monte Carlo for integration error in an RKHS.
- Shows faster sub-Gaussian concentration even when the RKHS is infinite-dimensional, the first result of this kind.
- Provides a pathway to potentially prove faster rates for kernel herding using tools from Gibbs measures and statistical physics.
- Simplifies technical arguments from previous statistical physics literature to make the proof more accessible.
- Shows experimental evidence supporting even faster convergence of the variance for a single integrand.

Limitations:
- Requires approximation of intractable normalizing constant and kernel embeddings.
- Assumes compact support of target distribution.
- No proof yet of faster convergence rate.

In summary, the paper makes an important step towards establishing faster integration error convergence for kernel herding algorithms.
