## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indoor navigation for autonomous vehicles is challenging due to limited GPS accuracy indoors. Existing solutions are either not robust enough or have high deployment costs due to reliance on multiple sensors.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an Affordable Indoor Navigation Solution (AINS) relying primarily on a mono camera for path detection and navigation.

- Key steps:
    1) Preprocess video stream from camera to remove noise
    2) Detect path based on color using HSV color space and contour analysis
    3) Calculate angle between path centroid and reference vector 
    4) Use angle to steer vehicle along path

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates indoor autonomous vehicle navigation using only a single mono camera, eliminating need for other sensors.
- Path detection based on color analysis and contour tracking in HSV space.
- Angle calculation method between centroid of detected path and reference vector.  
- Experiments show AINS has lower estimated error (1.2%) and faster operation than sensor-based method.

In summary, the key innovation is an affordable vision-based indoor navigation system for autonomous vehicles that operates reliably using just a single camera to detect paths and navigate, outperforming methods relying on multiple sensors. The approach is more robust and cost-effective compared to existing solutions.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an affordable indoor navigation solution called AINS for autonomous vehicles using a mono camera to detect color lines on the path and calculate the angle to the path centroid for steering control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting an affordable indoor navigation solution (AINS) for autonomous vehicles that relies primarily on a mono camera. Specifically, the paper proposes and demonstrates a method for detecting a path for an autonomous vehicle by processing images from a single camera mounted on the vehicle, calculating the angle to the path using image processing techniques, and steering the vehicle along the detected path. The proposed AINS system aims to provide an indoor navigation capability for autonomous vehicles while minimizing costs compared to solutions that rely on multiple sensors. The results presented show improved performance over a sensor-based navigation system in terms of lower estimated error and time consumption. In summary, the key contribution is an economical computer vision-based approach to indoor navigation of autonomous vehicles using mainly a mono camera.
