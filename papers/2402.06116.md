## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotics presents challenges due to lack of multimodal grounding and exposure to physical world dynamics. Task instructions are often ambiguous, requiring reasoning skills LLMs may lack. 

- There is a gap between language instructions/feedback and low-level robotic actions that needs to be bridged for effective human-robot collaboration.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors evaluate the recently released multimodal LLM - GPT-4V for embodied task planning in robotics. 

- They design prompts incorporating natural language instructions, environment images and predefined actions to query GPT-4V to generate step-by-step plans.

- GPT-4V leverages vision and language understanding to produce action plans aligned with instructions and environment dynamics.

Contributions:  

- Comprehensive literature review on integrating LLMs into planning, manipulation, reasoning and navigation tasks in robotics

- Proposal for using multimodal LLMs as robotic brains for embodied intelligence 

- Evaluation of GPT-4V on 15 datasets with diverse environments and manipulation instructions. Results validate viability and highlight reasoning potential.

- Identification of limitations regarding model transparency, robustness, safety and real-world applicability. 

- Suggestions for future work: Use contrastive learning for brain-computer interfaces in LLM-based systems to bridge human-environment interaction gap.

In summary, the paper systematically explores the integration of LLMs into robotics, leveraging GPT-4V's reasoning and multimodal understanding potential while highlighting challenges to be addressed as this area of research progresses.
