# [A Dense Subframe-based SLAM Framework with Side-scan Sonar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Side-scan sonar (SSS) images provide high-resolution images of the seafloor and are commonly used on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, using SSS images for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is challenging because it is difficult to establish accurate correspondences between images due to distortion and uneven ensonification. SSS also doesn't provide 3D measurements so position estimates are underdetermined from single pings. Prior works rely on manual annotation or simple feature/landmark extraction that are not robust.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a novel dense subframe-based SLAM framework that utilizes SSS images to refine AUV dead-reckoning trajectories and reconstruct quasi-dense bathymetry maps. Key ideas/components:

1) Apply image processing like intensity correction and slant range correction to reduce distortions and enable dense matching between SSS image pairs. 

2) Propose robust dense matching tailored to SSS images that combines dead-reckoning and imaging information to establish dense correspondences.

3) Divide SSS images into subframes and estimate relative poses between subframe pairs from dense correspondences using a robust pipeline with RANSAC, considering both measurement residuals and optimization costs.

4) Formulate global pose graph with subframe constraints and dead-reckoning odmometry constraints. Apply incremental smoothing and mapping to estimate optimized full trajectory.  

5) Reconstruct quasi-dense bathymetry point clouds using optimized trajectory and dense correspondences.

Main Contributions:

- Effective dense matching method tailored for SSS images for robust data association

- Novel subframe-based approach to deal with underconstrained single-ping SSS measurements  

- Robust estimation pipeline integrating dense correspondences for accurate subframe registration

- Full pipeline demonstrated with real datasets, metrics using manual annotation & MBES validation

- Open-source framework made available to benefit community
