# [Weakly-Supervised Text-driven Contrastive Learning for Facial Behavior   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00058)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:How to utilize coarse-grained textual information (activity descriptions) along with label names and descriptions to improve facial behavior understanding through contrastive learning?Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called CLEF (Contrastive Learning with Text-Embedded Framework for Facial behavior understanding) that addresses two key issues:1) How to utilize coarse-grained activity descriptions during pre-training to construct better positive/negative pairs for contrastive learning. This allows learning robust facial representations that focus more on behavior and less on identity.2) How to incorporate textual label names and descriptions during fine-tuning to improve facial expression and AU recognition. This enriches the label representation compared to just numerical labels. The main hypothesis is that by using both coarse activity descriptions and detailed label texts in a contrastive learning framework, the model can learn improved representations for facial behavior analysis tasks like expression recognition and AU detection.The proposed CLEF method is evaluated on 3 AU detection datasets and 3 expression recognition datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using textual information in contrastive learning for better facial behavior understanding.
