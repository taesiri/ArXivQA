# [KInIT at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Fine-tuned LLMs for Multilingual   Machine-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable generating high-quality multilingual texts that can be misused (e.g. for plagiarism, disinformation). Thus, detecting machine-generated texts is an important capability.  
- SemEval-2024 Task 8 focuses on multilingual, multidomain, and multigenerator machine text detection across 8 languages.

Proposed Solution:
- An ensemble system combining fine-tuned LLMs with statistical detection methods:
    - Fine-tuned Falcon-7B and Mistral-7B LLMs using parameter-efficient training
    - Statistical methods: Entropy, Rank, Binoculars 
    - Two-stage majority voting to combine predictions
    - Per-language threshold calibration using language identification

Key Contributions:
- Unique way of combining fine-tuned LLMs and statistical detection using two-stage majority voting and per-language calibration
- Evaluation of multiple system alternatives including per-language models and 7B parameter LLMs
- Fine-tuned 7B parameter LLMs achieve remarkably good performance 
- Best single model is robustly fine-tuned Mistral-7B, achieving 0.97 AUC ROC
- Submitted system ranks 4th in competition, within 1% of top system

In summary, the paper proposes an ensemble approach combining fine-tuned 7B parameter LLMs with statistical methods to detect multilingual machine-generated text. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution. Key innovations include the ensemble architecture and demonstration of 7B LLM capabilities for this task.
