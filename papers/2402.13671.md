# [KInIT at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Fine-tuned LLMs for Multilingual   Machine-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable generating high-quality multilingual texts that can be misused (e.g. for plagiarism, disinformation). Thus, detecting machine-generated texts is an important capability.  
- SemEval-2024 Task 8 focuses on multilingual, multidomain, and multigenerator machine text detection across 8 languages.

Proposed Solution:
- An ensemble system combining fine-tuned LLMs with statistical detection methods:
    - Fine-tuned Falcon-7B and Mistral-7B LLMs using parameter-efficient training
    - Statistical methods: Entropy, Rank, Binoculars 
    - Two-stage majority voting to combine predictions
    - Per-language threshold calibration using language identification

Key Contributions:
- Unique way of combining fine-tuned LLMs and statistical detection using two-stage majority voting and per-language calibration
- Evaluation of multiple system alternatives including per-language models and 7B parameter LLMs
- Fine-tuned 7B parameter LLMs achieve remarkably good performance 
- Best single model is robustly fine-tuned Mistral-7B, achieving 0.97 AUC ROC
- Submitted system ranks 4th in competition, within 1% of top system

In summary, the paper proposes an ensemble approach combining fine-tuned 7B parameter LLMs with statistical methods to detect multilingual machine-generated text. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution. Key innovations include the ensemble architecture and demonstration of 7B LLM capabilities for this task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble system combining fine-tuned 7B-parameter language models with statistical detection methods using per-language threshold calibration for multilingual machine-generated text detection, achieving competitive results in the SemEval-2024 shared task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1) Proposing a unique way of combining statistical and fine-tuned detection methods using a two-way majority voting and per-language threshold calibration.

2) Proposing and comparing three ensemble system alternatives to cope with multilingual machine-generated text detection. 

3) Experiencing remarkably good performance of fine-tuned language models with 7B parameters on this task, which they have not tried before.

4) Proposing the best-performing single-model system called rMistral (Mistral-7B fine-tuned in a robust way), achieving 0.97 AUC ROC on the test data.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed approach of combining fine-tuned language models and statistical methods in an ensemble using majority voting and calibrated thresholds, which improves the generalization capability for multilingual machine-generated text detection. The paper also shows that large pre-trained language models can achieve very strong performance on this task when fine-tuned properly.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a unique way of combining statistical and fine-tuned detection methods. Can you explain in detail how the two-way majority voting and per-language threshold calibration work to combine these methods? What are the advantages of this approach?

2. The paper compares three different ensemble system alternatives for multilingual machine-generated text detection. Can you summarize the key differences between the LLM2S3, PLMoE, and rLLM2S3 systems? What are the tradeoffs between them in terms of performance, computational complexity, and generalization capability? 

3. The paper reports remarkably good performance from fine-tuned 7B parameter LLMs like Falcon-7B and Mistral-7B. Why do you think such large models perform so well for this task compared to smaller models? What challenges did the authors face in using and fine-tuning these large models?

4. The paper proposes a best performing single-model system called rMistral that uses robust fine-tuning. Can you explain what robust fine-tuning means here and how it helps improve the model? What hyperparameter tuning could further boost rMistral's performance?  

5. The per-language analysis shows lower accuracy for German and Arabic despite them being present in the dev set. What could be the reasons for this? How can the robust system alternatives address this issue?

6. The paper observes optimal thresholds of 1.0 for LLMs when using dev set probabilities. Why would such conservative thresholds perform better? Could this just be a coincidence based on the test set? How would you validate this?

7. The PLMoE model suffers from overfitting issues. What causes this overfitting and how does early stopping help address it? Would you use cross-validation to pick the stopping epoch or some other method?

8. The rLLM2B-ES system proposed post deadline outperforms even the competition winner. Should the authors have submitted this given their comments about lack of confidence due to possible overfitting? What validation strategy would you propose?  

9. How suitable is the QLoRA method used for parameter efficient fine-tuning of large LLMs here? What optimizations can be made to the fine-tuning process apart from early stopping?

10. The paper proposes integrating FastText language identification in the pipeline. What challenges could inaccurate language prediction introduce? Would you use alternative language identification methods or build ensembles?
