# [ASIC: Aligning Sparse in-the-wild Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we obtain dense and consistent pixel correspondences between images in a small, unannotated image collection depicting an object or object category?

The key ideas and contributions of the paper in addressing this question appear to be:

- Proposing a method called ASIC to jointly align a sparse set of in-the-wild images by mapping them to a shared learned canonical space. 

- Leveraging noisy pseudo-correspondences obtained from off-the-shelf self-supervised vision models as a supervisory signal. A novel contrastive loss is used to refine these into accurate correspondences.

- Introducing additional equivariance and reconstruction losses to make the correspondences dense. 

- Demonstrating qualitatively that ASIC can find smooth and consistent mappings between images with significant variations.

- Evaluating quantitatively on standard benchmarks and showing competitive or superior performance compared to prior weakly supervised techniques.

- Proposing a new metric k-Cycle PCK to measure consistency of correspondences over multiple images, on which ASIC outperforms other methods significantly.

In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that by optimizing over an image collection directly, one can obtain dense correspondences without manual annotation by using off-the-shelf self-supervised features and appropriate losses. The results seem to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the utility of the proposed ASIC framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing a method called ASIC (Aligning Sparse In-the-wild Image Collections) for computing dense correspondences between images in a small collection capturing an object or object category. The method is self-supervised and does not require keypoint annotations or large datasets.

2. Leveraging noisy, sparse pseudo-correspondences from a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) model as a source of weak supervision. These pseudo-correspondences are made dense and globally consistent via an alignment network trained with a novel contrastive loss. 

3. Additional regularization losses for encouraging equivariance, smoothness, reconstruction, and part consistency.

4. Evaluation on multiple datasets (SPair-71k, CUB, PF-Willow, SAMURAI) showing the method is competitive or better than existing unsupervised correspondence techniques.

5. A new metric called k-cycle PCK to measure consistency of keypoint propagation over sequences of images, which better captures drift than traditional PCK. The method outperforms baselines on this metric by a large margin.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be a self-supervised framework for dense alignment of image collections by effectively utilizing signals from a pre-trained vision transformer model, despite limited data. The consistency of the learned mappings is a notable advantage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a self-supervised framework called ASIC for obtaining dense correspondence maps between images in a small in-the-wild collection by exploiting noisy pseudo-correspondences from a pre-trained vision transformer and enforcing consistency across the collection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on joint alignment of image collections:

- The main novelty is the use of noisy pseudo-correspondences from pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) to bootstrap the learning of dense correspondences, rather than relying on ground truth keypoints or large supervised datasets. This allows the method to work in a low-shot setting with just a small collection of images.

- Most prior work on image collection alignment uses some form of explicit supervision, either keypoint annotations, matching image pairs, or large datasets to train GANs or fine-tune CNNs. This work is different in utilizing only self-supervision on the test set images.

- Compared to other self-supervised approaches like Neural Best Buddies or Deep Matching Prior, a key difference is the joint optimization over the full image collection to learn a shared canonical space, rather than optimizing on image pairs independently.

- The proposed canonical grid parameterization allows modeling more complex deformations than some prior methods like PSCNet or Neural Congealing that use continuous regular grids.

- Evaluation on standard datasets like CUB and SPair-71k shows the method is competitive or better than recent self-supervised approaches. The new k-cycle consistency metric demonstrates advantages in consistency over image sequences.

- Limitations include reliance on the quality of ViT features, difficulty handling symmetric objects or large out-of-plane rotations, and limited interpretability of the learned canonical space compared to GAN-based approaches.

Overall, the core innovations seem to be in combining self-supervised ViT correspondences with test-time optimization of a canonical grid to achieve strong performance in a low-shot setting, advancing the state of the art in this niche area. But supervised methods still dominate for more general correspondence tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the pseudo-correspondences from the pre-trained SSL models. The authors note that using features from larger and more powerful SSL models improves performance, so exploring better SSL models for obtaining correspondences could further enhance results.

- Making the learned canonical grid more interpretable. The paper shows the learned grid is not very interpretable currently. Developing techniques to get a more structured and semantic grid could aid in understanding model capabilities and limitations. 

- Applying the framework to additional downstream tasks. The authors suggest exploring the use of the dense correspondences learned by their method for tasks like 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and tracking.

- Handling symmetric objects better. The paper notes a limitation in differentiating left vs right parts for symmetric objects. Methods to address this ambiguity could improve performance.

- Dealing with large shape/viewpoint changes. Another limitation is handling large out-of-plane rotations or shape changes. Improving flexibility of canonical grid or other extensions could help cover these cases. 

- Few-shot learning of new categories. The current method requires optimization on a per-category basis. Exploring meta-learning or other techniques for few-shot generalization to new categories with minimal data is noted as an interesting direction.

- Applications like edit propagation. The paper shows an example application of edit propagation using the dense alignments. More exploration of such applications for image/video editing and manipulation is suggested.

In summary, the core future directions focus on improving correspondences from SSL models, making the canonical mapping more interpretable, extending the framework to new applications, and enhancing the flexibility and generalization capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method called ASIC (Aligning Sparse in-the-wild Image Collections) for computing dense correspondences between images in a small collection depicting an object or object category captured in unconstrained settings. Given around 10-30 such in-the-wild images, ASIC is able to find pixel-level mappings between them in a completely unsupervised manner, without requiring any ground truth annotations or large datasets. This is achieved by first extracting noisy pseudo-correspondences between image pairs using off-the-shelf self-supervised vision models. These sparse matches are then densified and made globally consistent across all images by optimizing an alignment network and a shared canonical grid with a novel contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like CUB and SPair-71k show that ASIC produces high-quality dense correspondences that are competitive or better than existing unsupervised methods. A new metric called k-cycle PCK is also proposed to evaluate correspondence consistency over sequences of images. Limitations include ambiguity in symmetric objects and failure for large out-of-plane rotations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents ASIC, a method for aligning sparse in-the-wild image collections of objects or object categories. Given a small set of images (around 10-30) of an object category, ASIC computes dense and consistent pixel-level correspondences across the image collection in a self-supervised manner. 

The key idea is to leverage noisy pseudo-correspondences obtained from a pre-trained vision transformer as supervision to train a convolutional neural network. This alignment network maps image pixels to locations in a learned 2D canonical grid. A contrastive loss encourages the network to map mutually nearest neighbor features to the same location in this canonical grid. Additional losses based on equivariance, reconstruction, and part consistency are used to make the mapping smooth and dense. Experiments on datasets like CUB-200, SPair-71K, PF-Willow, and SAMURAI demonstrate ASIC can produce high quality dense correspondences comparable or better than existing unsupervised methods. A new metric called k-cycle PCK is also introduced to evaluate correspondence consistency over sequences of images. Overall, the paper presents a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised dense alignment of image collections in limited data regimes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents ASIC, a framework for aligning sparse in-the-wild image collections of objects or object categories. The key idea is to map pixels from all images in the collection to a consistent canonical space. This is achieved using a small convolutional neural network that predicts per-pixel canonical space coordinates for each input image. These coordinates correspond to locations in a learned 2D canonical grid which stores color and foreground probability values. The network is trained from scratch on the image collection using several losses. A contrastive loss on sparse pseudo-correspondences obtained from a pretrained vision transformer model encourages semantically similar points across images to map nearby in the canonical space. Additional losses encourage smoothness, enforce equivariance to geometric warps, and allow image reconstruction to aid optimization. The resulting canonical mapping allows mapping pixels from any image to any other image in the collection in a consistent way. Experiments on datasets like CUB and SPair-71k show the method produces dense and consistent alignments competitive with existing unsupervised correspondence techniques.
