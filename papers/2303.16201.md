# [ASIC: Aligning Sparse in-the-wild Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we obtain dense and consistent pixel correspondences between images in a small, unannotated image collection depicting an object or object category?

The key ideas and contributions of the paper in addressing this question appear to be:

- Proposing a method called ASIC to jointly align a sparse set of in-the-wild images by mapping them to a shared learned canonical space. 

- Leveraging noisy pseudo-correspondences obtained from off-the-shelf self-supervised vision models as a supervisory signal. A novel contrastive loss is used to refine these into accurate correspondences.

- Introducing additional equivariance and reconstruction losses to make the correspondences dense. 

- Demonstrating qualitatively that ASIC can find smooth and consistent mappings between images with significant variations.

- Evaluating quantitatively on standard benchmarks and showing competitive or superior performance compared to prior weakly supervised techniques.

- Proposing a new metric k-Cycle PCK to measure consistency of correspondences over multiple images, on which ASIC outperforms other methods significantly.

In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that by optimizing over an image collection directly, one can obtain dense correspondences without manual annotation by using off-the-shelf self-supervised features and appropriate losses. The results seem to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the utility of the proposed ASIC framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing a method called ASIC (Aligning Sparse In-the-wild Image Collections) for computing dense correspondences between images in a small collection capturing an object or object category. The method is self-supervised and does not require keypoint annotations or large datasets.

2. Leveraging noisy, sparse pseudo-correspondences from a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) model as a source of weak supervision. These pseudo-correspondences are made dense and globally consistent via an alignment network trained with a novel contrastive loss. 

3. Additional regularization losses for encouraging equivariance, smoothness, reconstruction, and part consistency.

4. Evaluation on multiple datasets (SPair-71k, CUB, PF-Willow, SAMURAI) showing the method is competitive or better than existing unsupervised correspondence techniques.

5. A new metric called k-cycle PCK to measure consistency of keypoint propagation over sequences of images, which better captures drift than traditional PCK. The method outperforms baselines on this metric by a large margin.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be a self-supervised framework for dense alignment of image collections by effectively utilizing signals from a pre-trained vision transformer model, despite limited data. The consistency of the learned mappings is a notable advantage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a self-supervised framework called ASIC for obtaining dense correspondence maps between images in a small in-the-wild collection by exploiting noisy pseudo-correspondences from a pre-trained vision transformer and enforcing consistency across the collection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on joint alignment of image collections:

- The main novelty is the use of noisy pseudo-correspondences from pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) to bootstrap the learning of dense correspondences, rather than relying on ground truth keypoints or large supervised datasets. This allows the method to work in a low-shot setting with just a small collection of images.

- Most prior work on image collection alignment uses some form of explicit supervision, either keypoint annotations, matching image pairs, or large datasets to train GANs or fine-tune CNNs. This work is different in utilizing only self-supervision on the test set images.

- Compared to other self-supervised approaches like Neural Best Buddies or Deep Matching Prior, a key difference is the joint optimization over the full image collection to learn a shared canonical space, rather than optimizing on image pairs independently.

- The proposed canonical grid parameterization allows modeling more complex deformations than some prior methods like PSCNet or Neural Congealing that use continuous regular grids.

- Evaluation on standard datasets like CUB and SPair-71k shows the method is competitive or better than recent self-supervised approaches. The new k-cycle consistency metric demonstrates advantages in consistency over image sequences.

- Limitations include reliance on the quality of ViT features, difficulty handling symmetric objects or large out-of-plane rotations, and limited interpretability of the learned canonical space compared to GAN-based approaches.

Overall, the core innovations seem to be in combining self-supervised ViT correspondences with test-time optimization of a canonical grid to achieve strong performance in a low-shot setting, advancing the state of the art in this niche area. But supervised methods still dominate for more general correspondence tasks.
