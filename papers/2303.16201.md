# [ASIC: Aligning Sparse in-the-wild Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we obtain dense and consistent pixel correspondences between images in a small, unannotated image collection depicting an object or object category?The key ideas and contributions of the paper in addressing this question appear to be:- Proposing a method called ASIC to jointly align a sparse set of in-the-wild images by mapping them to a shared learned canonical space. - Leveraging noisy pseudo-correspondences obtained from off-the-shelf self-supervised vision models as a supervisory signal. A novel contrastive loss is used to refine these into accurate correspondences.- Introducing additional equivariance and reconstruction losses to make the correspondences dense. - Demonstrating qualitatively that ASIC can find smooth and consistent mappings between images with significant variations.- Evaluating quantitatively on standard benchmarks and showing competitive or superior performance compared to prior weakly supervised techniques.- Proposing a new metric k-Cycle PCK to measure consistency of correspondences over multiple images, on which ASIC outperforms other methods significantly.In summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that by optimizing over an image collection directly, one can obtain dense correspondences without manual annotation by using off-the-shelf self-supervised features and appropriate losses. The results seem to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the utility of the proposed ASIC framework.
