# [Attentive Mask CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08653)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:

How can we improve the efficiency and efficacy of CLIP training by strategically masking image tokens rather than using full images?

Specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Randomly masking image tokens during CLIP training can harm accuracy compared to using full images, due to discarding semantics relevant to the text. 

2) An attentive masking strategy that retains semantically relevant tokens can improve efficiency while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to full image CLIP training.

3) The proposed attentive masking approach also enables incorporating multiple masked views and auxiliary self-supervised objectives like contrastive learning between views, further boosting performance.

4) The attentive masking acts as a strong data augmentation, allowing longer CLIP training to boost efficacy more than when using full images.

In summary, the central research question is how to improve CLIP training efficiency and efficacy through an attentive image token masking strategy and associated techniques. The paper aims to validate the hypotheses that this can outperform full image training in accuracy and efficiency.
