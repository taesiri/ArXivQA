# [Exploring the hierarchical structure of human plans via program   generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18644)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores how people form hierarchically-structured plans using an experimental paradigm called Lightbot. In Lightbot, participants create programs with primitive actions (like walk and turn) as well as reusable subroutines to guide a robot to light up tiles in an environment. This lets researchers directly observe the hierarchical plans people construct. The authors compare different computational accounts, including minimizing the number of actions (trace length) and program length (minimum description length or MDL). However, both accounts fail to capture people's tendency to reuse subroutines more than strictly needed. To explain this, the authors propose grammar induction, which uses the principle of rich-get-richer to encourage reusing previously-defined subroutines. In this model, planning involves jointly inferring a grammar over subroutines along with the structure of the plan. Analysis of participant data shows grammar induction better explains behavior compared to the simpler utility maximization or MDL accounts. Additional results suggest hierarchies that have greater subroutine reuse are easier for people to write and mentally simulate. Overall, the study illustrates how computational modeling and process-tracing experiments can reveal signatures of hierarchy and planning that go beyond simple notions of efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a computational framework based on grammar induction to model how people construct hierarchically-structured plans, finding evidence that humans have a bias towards reusing previously-defined subroutines when forming plans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Developing a framework based on grammar induction to model the hierarchical structure of human plans. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces a process-tracing experimental paradigm using the Lightbot environment to collect data on explicitly represented hierarchical plans created by participants to solve tasks.

2) Proposes treating hierarchical plan inference as grammar induction over sequences of actions, with a prior distribution that incorporates rich-get-richer dynamics to capture people's bias towards reusing previously defined subroutines. 

3) Shows that this grammar induction model better predicts human behavior compared to simpler utility maximization or minimum description length accounts. The model particularly captures people's qualitative preference for reuse not explained by the other models.

4) Provides additional analyses suggesting the hierarchies people choose simplify planning, since participants create common programs faster and with less reliance on explicit program execution.

In summary, the main contribution is using ideas from grammar induction to develop a computational framework that can capture the preference for reuse in hierarchical planning. The experimental paradigm also facilitates new analyses about how hierarchy impacts the difficulty of planning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Hierarchical planning - The paper studies how people create complex, hierarchical plans to accomplish goals. This involves breaking down tasks into subtasks.

- Process tracing - The experimental paradigm used where participants create explicit hierarchical programs that are analyzed to understand the structure of their planning.

- Lightbot - The specific process tracing environment used where participants guide a robot by creating programs with primitive actions and subroutines. 

- Minimum description length (MDL) - A principle for modeling hierarchical plans based on preferring compressed representations.

- Grammar induction - The key model proposed in the paper, where planning is treated as inferring a probabilistic grammar over actions. Captures a bias towards reusing previously-used subroutines. 

- Adaptor grammars - The formal framework used to model the grammar induction account, allowing subroutine probabilities to depend on past usage history.

- Bayesian program induction - The general methodology of defining a prior over programs and using Bayes' rule to get a posterior predictive distribution.

- Sequence learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, utility maximization - Other literatures drawn upon and concepts involved in studying hierarchical planning.

The key terms mostly revolve around the methodology of using process tracing with Lightbot to study hierarchical planning and the grammar induction account proposed based on principles from MDL and adaptor grammars.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes modeling planning as Bayesian program induction. How does this approach differ from standard formulations of planning based on Markov decision processes or reinforcement learning? What are the benefits of formulating planning in this way?

2. The paper introduces a likelihood term that requires programs to solve the Lightbot task. How is this likelihood term defined formally? What role does it play in the overall framework?

3. The paper compares several priors over programs, including minimzing trace length, MDL, and grammar induction. What are the key differences between these priors in terms of their assumptions and the types of programs they will tend to favor? 

4. The grammar induction prior incorporates reuse of subroutines through a Chinese restaurant process. Exactly how is this distribution used to bias the choice of new subroutines towards those used more often in the past? 

5. The paper claims the grammar induction prior can capture intuitive solutions missed by alternative priors. What is a specific example of this from the paper and why do minimzing trace length and MDL fail to predict it?

6. The approximate inference procedure generates a corpus of programs by first searching for viable traces. What search algorithm and heuristics are used for this? Why is the choice of an appropriate heuristic important here?

7. After finding traces, the paper describes generating multiple candidate programs from each trace. What is the procedure used for this rewriting step? What special cases are added to match patterns seen in human data?

8. The model comparison shows the grammar induction + step cost model fits human data the best. Why might combining the grammar induction and step cost priors lead to better prediction compared to each individually?

9. The analysis shows participants writing more common programs execute their programs fewer times. What does this suggest about how hierarchy can simplify planning and reasoning?

10. The grammar induction approach is presented at the computational level. What are some possibilities discussed for process-level or algorithmic implementations that could capture the rich-get-richer dynamics?
