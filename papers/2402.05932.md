# [Driving Everywhere with Large Language Model Policy Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) currently operate primarily in geo-fenced areas due to their inability to adapt driving behavior to new environments, customs, and laws. Variations in traffic rules across locations range from significant (e.g. left-hand vs right-hand driving) to subtle (e.g. right turn on red allowed in some cities but not others). Both humans and AVs struggle to adapt to novel driving norms, leading to unpredictable behaviors and unsafe situations. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes LLaDA - a Large Language Driving Assistant that leverages the impressive zero-shot generalization capability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret local traffic rules and adapt AV motion plans accordingly. LLaDA takes four natural language inputs: 
1) Nominal execution plan 
2) Traffic code of current location
3) Description of current scene  
4) Description of any unexpected scenario

It processes these inputs through two main modules - The Traffic Rule Extractor (TRE) which extracts relevant paragraphs from the traffic code, and the LLM Planner which adapts the nominal plan based on TRE's output.

Main Contributions:
1. Proposes LLaDA - a training-free mechanism to assist human drivers and adapt AV policies to new environments by distilling knowledge from LLMs
2. LLaDA can be readily applied to any AV stack to improve performance in new locations with different traffic rules
3. Achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on user studies and experiments on the nuScenes dataset

The paper discusses using LLaDA both as a tourist assistance tool by querying for updated plans in unfamiliar scenarios, and for automatic adaptation of AV motion plans to unfamiliar locations. Evaluations demonstrate LLaDA's ability to provide useful updated plans in challenging human test cases, and improved trajectory metrics for an AV trained in Singapore when deployed in Boston.
