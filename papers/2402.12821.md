# [Identifying Factual Inconsistency in Summaries: Towards Effective   Utilization of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12821)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Abstractive text summarization models like BART can generate factual inconsistencies between the summary and source document. Detecting these inconsistencies is important for safe deployment. 
- Prior work used BERT-based natural language inference (NLI) models or question answering pipelines, but opportunities exist to utilize large language models (LLMs).

Methods:
- Proposed and evaluated three zero-shot LLM paradigms on 5 datasets:
   - Summ-NLI: Score factual consistency of entire (document, summary) pair at once
   - Sent-NLI: Apply NLI on each summary sentence window then aggregate
   - QG-QA: Explicitly verify summary entities through question generation and answering

- Additionally proposed training strategies to distill smaller open-source LLM, learning from both gold labels and reasoning of more capable LLMs.

Results:
- Sent-NLI and QG-QA outperform prior SoTA by 2.8% on average. Show importance of proper paradigm design for LLMs.
- Open-source 13B model performs close to ChatGPT. Moving to GPT-4 gives over 10% gain.
- Distilled 7B Llama model outperforms ChatGPT paradigms while remaining efficient. Strategies incorporating reasoning give 2% robust improvement.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive evaluation of leveraging LLMs' reasoning ability for factual consistency detection through 3 paradigms 
- Analysis of model sizes and paradigm designs
- Distillation strategies to obtain efficient open-source models with both high efficacy and efficiency

The summary covers the key points about the problem being addressed, the proposed LLM-based solutions, results showing their effectiveness, and main contributions made in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
