# [Enhancing Video Transformers for Action Understanding with VLM-aided   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision Transformers (ViTs) currently achieve the best performance for video action understanding but have limited generalization ability across domains or datasets. On the other hand, Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown exceptional generalization performance but cannot process videos and extract spatio-temporal patterns critical for action understanding.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes the Four-tiered Prompts (FTP) framework to take advantage of the complementary strengths of ViTs and VLMs. The key idea is to retain ViTs' ability to learn strong spatio-temporal representations from videos but improve their generalization capability by aligning the visual features with descriptive outputs from VLMs during training.

- Specifically, the FTP framework adds four feature processors to a ViT that focus on different aspects of actions through prompts: category, components, detailed description, context. The VLM provides textual descriptions only during training. Contrastive loss aligns the visual features from the ViT with the textual embeddings from the prompts.

- During inference, only the ViT is used with negligible overhead from the added processors. But the aligned visual features are richer and more domain-general. Fine-tuning adapts the features to a target dataset or domain.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel framework FTP to enhance video Transformers using easy-to-obtain textual supervision from VLMs during training. Shows strong performance while adding minimal computation overhead.

- Demonstrates the potential of integrating language models into the video domain to improve model generalization.

- Reports state-of-the-art results on major video action recognition benchmarks, outperforming previous best methods by clear margins. For example, 93.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 (+2.8%) and 83.4% on Something-Something V2 (+2.6%).


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Four-Tiered Prompts (FTP) framework that enhances video transformers for action understanding by aligning their visual encodings with textual descriptions from visual language models during training, through the use of four feature processors focusing on different aspects of actions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The proposal of a novel Four-Tiered Prompts (FTP) framework that focuses on different aspects of the video action by incorporating semantic information from visual language models (VLMs) into the visual encodings of video transformers (ViTs). 

2. Demonstrating the potential of integrating language models into the video domain to enhance model performance.

3. Reporting strong performance on video action recognition benchmarks, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods by clear margins.

Specifically, the FTP framework adds four feature processors to a ViT that focus on different aspects of human actions in videos - action category, action components, action description, and context information. The feature processors are trained using VLM outputs to produce more comprehensive and general video encodings. This approach retains the spatio-temporal representation strength of ViTs while improving their generalization ability. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on major datasets while having lower computation cost than recent methods.

The paper proposes a Four-Tiered Prompts (FTP) framework to enhance Vision Transformers for video action understanding. The framework uses a Visual Language Model to generate textual descriptions of videos based on four prompts focusing on different aspects of the action. These descriptions are used via contrastive learning to train feature processors to align the visual features from the Vision Transformer. This results in richer, more comprehensive spatio-temporal video embeddings that generalize better across datasets. The approach is evaluated on datasets like Kinetics and Something-Something V2 and shows state-of-the-art performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a Four-Tiered Prompts (FTP) framework that utilizes both Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs). Can you explain in more detail how the complementary strengths of ViTs and VLMs are leveraged in this framework?

2. The FTP framework adds four feature processors that focus on different aspects of human actions in videos - action category, action components, action description, and context information. What is the motivation behind having these four specific feature processors?

3. Contrastive learning is used in the first stage of training to align the outputs of the four feature processors with text embeddings from the VLM. Can you explain why contrastive learning is suitable for this visual-textual alignment?

4. The paper shows that using prompts from the VLM consistently improves performance across different backbone ViTs. What limitations of current ViTs do you think the additional prompts are able to mitigate?

5. An analysis is provided on the relative contribution of different prompts. If you were to design additional prompts, what aspects of human actions would you focus on that are not already covered by the existing prompts?

6. The framework incurs minimal additional computation cost during inference since the VLM outputs are only used during training. Do you see potential ways to utilize the VLM during inference as well to further improve performance?

7. The paper demonstrates strong performance on multiple action recognition benchmarks. What are some real-world applications that this approach could be useful for?

8. The approach seems to perform worse on classes where motion cues are more discriminative than static visual cues. How can the framework be improved to handle such cases better?  

9. The concatenation of keyframes limits the capability to represent temporal evolution of actions well for the VLM. What are some potential solutions to address this?

10. The framework currently targets only action understanding tasks. What are your thoughts on extending this approach to other video understanding tasks such as video captioning? What challenges do you foresee?
