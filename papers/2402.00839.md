# [X-CBA: Explainability Aided CatBoosted Anomal-E for Intrusion Detection   System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00839)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical for identifying cyber threats, but adoption of ML/DL models in IDS has created a "trust deficit" due to their non-transparent decision making. 
- There is a lack of research combining advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) based IDS with Explainable AI (XAI) to bridge this gap.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel IDS called X-CBA that integrates a GNN pipeline with the CatBoost classifier and the PGExplainer XAI method. 
- It processes network traffic data effectively using graph representations and network flows (collections of connections between hosts).
- PGExplainer provides local and global explainability into the GNN's decision making by identifying key network flows.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves high 99.47% accuracy in threat detection using network flows and graph edge embeddings.
- Enhanced detection over state-of-the-art through integration of GNN and CatBoost. 
- Implements PGExplainer XAI for superior local and global explainability compared to baselines.
- Bridges gap between ML/DL adoption and transparency in IDS through advanced explainability.
- Facilitates integration of ML/DL in cybersecurity by offering precise and interpretable explainability.

In summary, the paper introduces an advanced IDS called X-CBA that leverages GNNs and XAI. It achieves high accuracy in threat detection while also providing transparent explanations for its decisions through analysis of network flows. This bridges the gap inhibiting wider adoption of ML/DL in security.
