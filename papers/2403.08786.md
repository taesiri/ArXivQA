# [One-Spike SNN: Single-Spike Phase Coding with Base Manipulation for   ANN-to-SNN Conversion Loss Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are much more energy-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their event-driven computation using spikes. However, training SNNs is difficult and converting pre-trained ANNs to SNNs often incur accuracy loss. Prior conversion methods suffer from either long latency, high spike rate per neuron, or constraints on the ANN models.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a highly efficient yet accurate ANN-to-SNN conversion method using a novel single-spike phase coding scheme. The key ideas are:

1) Single-Spike Approximation: Allow only one spike per neuron in hidden layers to minimize spike rate and energy consumption.  

2) Threshold Shift: Shift neuron threshold to enable round-off approximation of activations, preventing accuracy loss.

3) Base Manipulation: Manipulate the base (Q) of phase coding to minimize conversion error. Derive optimal Q at a given timestep.  

The proposed techniques enable low-latency and high-accuracy conversion without constraints on ANN training or structure.

Main Contributions:

- General ANN-to-SNN conversion process without accuracy loss or constraints on ANN models.

- High energy-efficiency thanks to single-spike approximation, leading to 4.59-17.26x improvement over ANNs.

- Negligible accuracy loss of 0.35-0.9% on various CNN and GCN models tested on CIFAR, ImageNet and other datasets.

- Short latency owing to proper choice of phase coding parameters guided by theoretical analysis.

In summary, this paper proposed an SNN conversion method that is low-latency, energy-efficient and accurate without restricting the ANN model choices. The techniques open up the applicability of SNNs to a wide range of pre-trained ANN models.
