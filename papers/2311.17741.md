# [End-to-end Joint Rich and Normalized ASR with a limited amount of rich   training data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17741)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces and compares two approaches to train an end-to-end streaming speech recognition system that can jointly produce rich transcriptions (with punctuation and capitalization) as well as normalized transcriptions (without punctuation and capitalization), using only a limited amount of richly transcribed training data. The first approach generates pseudo-rich training data by passing normalized transcriptions through a language model to add punctuation and capitalization. The second approach conditions the prediction network on the desired output type. Experiments on the LibriSpeech and AMI corpora demonstrate the feasibility of the conditioned predictor approach with as little as 5% rich training data, with only a moderate increase in errors. The pseudo-rich training approach leads to lower error rates on out-of-domain test data, with up to 9% relative reduction compared to models trained on human-generated rich transcripts. The results demonstrate the promise of both approaches for building accurate and efficient joint rich and normalized speech recognition systems in low-resource scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares two approaches to train an end-to-end stateless transducer-based model for joint rich (with punctuation and capitalization) and normalized (without punctuation and capitalization) speech recognition using a limited amount of rich training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces and compares two approaches to train an end-to-end (E2E) joint rich and normalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can produce transcriptions both with and without punctuation and capitalization. 

2) The first approach uses a language model to generate pseudo-rich transcriptions of normalized training data. Experiments show this approach leads to E2E rich ASR which performs better on out-of-domain data, with up to 9% relative reduction in errors.

3) The second approach uses a single decoder conditioned on the type of output (rich or normalized). This approach demonstrates the feasibility of training an E2E joint rich and normalized ASR system using as little as 5% rich training data with only a moderate 2.42% absolute increase in errors.

In summary, the paper contributes two complementary approaches to train an E2E streaming-capable joint rich and normalized ASR system with limited rich labeled training data. The first approach leverages external language models while the second approach relies on a conditioned predictor.

The paper compares two approaches to train an end-to-end ASR system that can jointly produce rich (with punctuation and capitalization) and normalized (without punctuation and capitalization) transcriptions from speech, using a limited amount of rich training data. The key focus is on methods that are streaming capable and don't require large pretrained models. The two approaches are: 1) using a language model to generate pseudo-rich training data, and 2) a single decoder conditioned on output type. Overall, the paper is focused on joint rich and normalized transcription, limited training data scenarios, and streaming applications in the context of end-to-end ASR.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two approaches for training an end-to-end joint rich and normalized automatic speech recognition system with limited rich training data. What are these two approaches and how do they differ?

2. In the first approach, a language model is used to generate pseudo-rich transcriptions from normalized training data. What potential issues could arise from using automatically generated pseudo-rich transcriptions compared to human-labeled rich transcriptions?  

3. The second approach uses a single decoder conditioned on the output type through a mode embedding. How does conditioning the predictor enable effective utilization of both rich and normalized training data?

4. The paper introduces new evaluation metrics like Case-only Error Rate and Punctuation-only Error Rate. Why are these new metrics necessary and how do they provide better assessment compared to traditional Word Error Rate?

5. Results show that models trained on pseudo-rich data perform worse on in-domain test data but better on out-of-domain data compared to models trained on human-labeled rich data. What could explain this domain discrepancy in performance?

6. The conditioned predictor model is shown to work reasonably well even with only 5% rich training data. What adaptations need to be made to the model architecture and training procedure to enable this? 

7. The paper focuses on capitalization and punctuation prediction. How can the proposed approaches be extended to transcription of other speech phenomena like disfluencies?

8. Both proposed models use a stateless transducer architecture. Why is a streaming capable model important for joint rich and normalized transcription?

9. Error analysis reveals the conditioned predictor model performs worse on capitalization prediction. What enhancements could improve capitalization accuracy?

10. The model results are benchmarked against a cascaded system. What are the advantages and disadvantages of end-to-end modeling compared to cascaded systems for rich transcription?
