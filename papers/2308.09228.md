# [Generalized Sum Pooling for Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09228)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve feature aggregation in deep metric learning through optimal transport-based pooling. The key hypothesis is that modeling feature aggregation as an optimal transport problem with entropy regularization will enable learning to select the most discriminative features while disregarding nuisance information.Specifically, the paper proposes a novel pooling method called Generalized Sum Pooling (GSP) which formulates feature aggregation as an optimal transport problem between feature maps and a set of trainable prototypes. By adding entropy regularization, GSP allows learning a soft selection of the most relevant features for the task. This is hypothesized to improve feature aggregation compared to common techniques like global average pooling that treat all features equally. The paper empirically validates this hypothesis by plugging GSP into various metric learning methods and evaluating on image retrieval benchmarks. The consistent improvements demonstrate the ability of GSP to learn selective feature aggregation that improves discrimination compared to global average pooling.In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling feature aggregation as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem enables learning to selectively aggregate the most discriminative features, which improves deep metric learning performance. The paper provides both theoretical justification for GSP as well as extensive experiments that validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel learnable pooling method called Generalized Sum Pooling (GSP) for deep metric learning. The key ideas are:- GSP generalizes global average pooling (GAP) by enabling two new capabilities: 1) Selecting a subset of discriminative features and suppressing nuisance information 2) Learning feature weights according to their importance. - GSP is formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem that transports information from feature maps to a set of learnable prototypes. This formulation allows end-to-end training and results in a differentiable pooling layer.- A zero-shot regularization loss is proposed to facilitate learning of semantic prototypes and improve generalization. - The method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets using different deep metric learning losses. Results show consistent improvements over GAP and attention-based pooling methods like DeLF.In summary, the main contribution is a novel generalized pooling method with explicit feature selection and weighting abilities. This is achieved via an optimal transport formulation that can be optimized end-to-end. Evaluations demonstrate improved performance across various datasets and losses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel learnable pooling method called Generalized Sum Pooling (GSP) that improves upon global average pooling (GAP) for deep metric learning by enabling the network to learn to select a subset of discriminative features and assign importance weights through an entropy-regularized optimal transport formulation.In short, the paper introduces GSP, a learnable replacement for GAP, that can learn to filter out nuisance features and focus on discriminative ones for better deep metric learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:The paper presents a new method called Generalized Sum Pooling (GSP) for aggregating features in deep metric learning models. The key ideas are:- GSP generalizes global average pooling (GAP) by learning to select a subset of discriminative features and weighting their importance. This provides an explicit mechanism to ignore nuisance features, unlike GAP which weights all features equally.- GSP formulates feature selection and weighting as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem between feature maps and trainable prototypes. This allows differentiable end-to-end learning.- A closed-form expression is derived for the loss gradient, enabling efficient backpropagation without storing intermediate variables. - GSP improves generalization by reducing overlap between class convex hulls in the embedding space.Compared to other research:- Most prior work uses GAP, max pooling, or attention mechanisms like DeLF for feature aggregation. GSP provides a new optimal transport formulation for learnable feature selection and weighting.- Methods like NetVLAD and OTP use clustering or optimal transport for aggregation but don't enable selecting a subset of features. They produce high-dimensional representations unlike GSP.- GSP demonstrates consistent improvement over GAP across losses and datasets. It also combines well with max pooling variations like GeMean and GMP.- GSP achieves state-of-the-art results compared to recent methods on standard benchmarks. The gains are more pronounced on challenging datasets with nuisances.In summary, GSP introduces a new optimal transport based pooling method with an explicit feature selection mechanism and strong empirical performance. The feature weighting interpretation and zero-shot regularization loss are also novel compared to prior work.
