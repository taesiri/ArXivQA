# [Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09687)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:

How can large language models effectively solve complex, elaborate problems without requiring any model updates? 

The paper introduces a framework called "Graph of Thoughts" (GoT) that aims to enhance the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models through a novel graph-based prompting approach. The key ideas are:

1) Modeling the LLM's reasoning process as an arbitrary graph, where vertices are "thoughts" and edges indicate dependencies between thoughts. 

2) Enabling complex transformations of thoughts (e.g. aggregation, refinement) through graph-based operations. This allows combining and reinforcing strengths of different thoughts while eliminating weaknesses.

3) Carefully designing a modular architecture to implement GoT, with fine-grained control over individual thoughts and seamless extensibility. 

4) Illustrating use cases like sorting, keyword counting, set operations, document merging that can benefit from graph-based prompting.

5) Empirically evaluating GoT against baselines like chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, showing improvements in accuracy and cost-effectiveness, especially for more complex tasks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling LLM reasoning as arbitrary graphs and enabling graph-based thought transformations can enhance prompting capabilities and allow solving more elaborate problems without any model updates. The paper aims to introduce the GoT framework and empirically validate its advantages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT), a new prompting framework that models the LLM reasoning process as an arbitrary graph, where vertices are LLM thoughts and edges represent dependencies between thoughts. This enables novel "graph-enabled" transformations of thoughts within a prompt, such as aggregating or combining thoughts. 

2. Designing a modular system architecture for implementing GoT, which provides fine-grained control over individual thoughts and can seamlessly incorporate new thought transformations, reasoning patterns, and LLM models.

3. Demonstrating several use cases of GoT on tasks like sorting, keyword counting, set operations, and document merging, and detailing their implementation using the graph-based paradigm.

4. Evaluating GoT and showing its advantages over prior prompting schemes like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughts. The results illustrate that GoT is particularly well-suited for tasks that can be decomposed into subtasks and merged incrementally.

5. Proposing a new metric called "volume of a thought" to quantify the amount of information/context available to an LLM output, and arguing that GoT enables higher volume thoughts compared to other schemes.

In summary, the key novelty and advantage of GoT seems to be its ability to model LLM reasoning as an arbitrary graph, which generalizes prior prompting schemes and enables more powerful transformations like aggregation. The modular architecture and comparative evaluations further demonstrate the benefits of this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a high-level comparison of the key contributions of this paper to other related work:

- This paper introduces a new framework called Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) for enhancing reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through prompts. It allows modeling the LLM's reasoning process as an arbitrary graph, going beyond prior work like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) that use simpler chain or tree structures.

- A major contribution is the ability to perform graph-based transformations on LLM thoughts, like aggregating or combining thoughts. This is more powerful than CoT or ToT, enabling new prompting capabilities. For example, the paper shows this can be used for tasks like merging sorted subarrays in sorting problems.

- The paper proposes a flexible architecture for implementing GoT, highlighting the ability to control and transform individual thoughts. It also ensures extensibility to new models like GPT-3.5 or LLaMA-2.

- It provides examples of using GoT for diverse tasks like sorting, keyword counting, set operations, and document merging. The evaluation shows advantages over CoT and ToT, like 70% higher quality in sorting while reducing cost.

- It analyzes the latency-volume tradeoff theoretically. GoT provides low latency like ToT but high volume like CoT by using thought aggregation.

- Experimenting on larger datasets: The authors present results on relatively small datasets. Testing GoT on larger benchmarks could better analyze its capabilities and limitations.

- Trying different LLMs: The authors mainly experiment with GPT-3.5. Evaluating GoT with more powerful models like GPT-4 could shed light on how its performance evolves.

In summary, the authors suggest many promising research directions to further advance prompting techniques using graph-based frameworks like GoT across tasks, models, and domains. Developing better prompting strategies remains an important area to maximize the reasoning abilities of LLMs without requiring model updates.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Graph of Thoughts (GoT), a new framework for enhancing the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through structured prompting. GoT represents the LLM's thinking process as a graph, where each vertex is a "thought" or partial solution generated by the LLM, and edges represent dependencies between thoughts. This graph abstraction enables complex thought transformations like aggregating multiple thoughts or refining existing thoughts through feedback loops. GoT offers more flexibility than prior prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought or Tree-of-Thoughts which impose linear chains or tree structures. Through case studies on tasks like sorting, set operations, and document merging, the authors show GoT can improve accuracy and reduce costs compared to these other prompting schemes. A key advantage is the ability to decompose problems into easier sub-tasks, solve them independently, then combine solutions. Overall, GoT advances prompting capabilities in LLMs by enabling non-linear, networked reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new framework called Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through networked reasoning, without requiring any model updates. The key idea is to model the reasoning process of an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where vertices represent LLM thoughts and edges represent dependencies between thoughts. This graph abstraction enables novel thought transformations such as aggregating multiple thoughts into a new one, which generalizes prior prompting schemes like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughts. The authors propose a modular system architecture for implementing GoT that provides fine-grained control over individual thoughts and is easily extensible. They demonstrate GoT on tasks like sorting, set operations, keyword counting, and document merging, showing improved accuracy and reduced costs compared to the state of the art. GoT is particularly advantageous for complex tasks that can be decomposed into smaller subtasks. The authors also introduce a new metric called "volume of a thought" to characterize prompting schemes based on the potential contribution of prior thoughts. Overall, modeling LLM reasoning as a graph enhances prompting capabilities without model updates.

The key advantage of GoT is its ability to represent LLM reasoning as an arbitrary graph, which enables complex thought transformations like aggregation that are not naturally expressible with prior prompting schemes. By decomposing difficult problems into simpler subtasks that are solved and merged incrementally, GoT improves accuracy and reduces costs compared to approaches like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughts. The modular architecture facilitates rapid experimentation. The volume metric provides further insights into differences between prompting schemes. GoT brings LLM reasoning closer to human thinking by incorporating graph structures like recurrence. This work illustrates the benefits of graph-based reasoning for enhancing LLM prompting.
