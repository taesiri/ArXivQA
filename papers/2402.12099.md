# [Human Video Translation via Query Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Human Video Translation via Query Warping":

Problem:
- Generating a human video by transferring the motion from a source video to a target person, while controlling the style via text prompts, is an important task. 
- However, directly generating each frame independently fails to preserve temporal consistency across frames in the synthesized video.
- Existing diffusion-based video editing methods rely on sharing key and value tokens across frames, but still result in inconsistencies as the query tokens can vary across frames.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "QueryWarp", a novel framework to translate human motion videos with temporal coherence. 
- It first extracts dense appearance flows between frames using the pose sequence. 
- Then in the diffusion model's decoding process, it warps the query token from the previous frame using the flows and fuses it with the current frame's query token.
- This "flow-guided attention" imposes explicit constraints between query tokens of adjacent frames to ensure smooth translations.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies inconsistency of query tokens across frames as a cause of temporal incoherence in translated videos.
- Introduces appearance flows based on shared pose sequence to build correlations between query tokens of different frames.
- Proposes a flow-guided attention mechanism to warp query tokens using flows to enforce coherence.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on human motion translation with both quantitative metrics and user studies.
- Framework is robust and does not require fine-tuning diffusion model for each specific video.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to utilize appearance flows for guiding the query attention in diffusion models to address the problem of temporal inconsistency in human video translation. The flow-guided attention demonstrably outperforms prior arts.
