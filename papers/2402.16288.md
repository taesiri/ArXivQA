# [PerLTQA: A Personal Long-Term Memory Dataset for Memory Classification,   Retrieval, and Synthesis in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Long-term memory plays a critical role in personal interactions by allowing the use of world knowledge, historical information, and preferences in dialogues. 
- However, existing QA and dialogue datasets lack comprehensive coverage of both semantic memory (e.g. profiles, relationships) and episodic memory (e.g. events, dialogues).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce PerLTQA, a novel QA dataset with a memory database of profiles, relationships, events and dialogues for 30 characters. 
- They propose memory classification, retrieval, and synthesis tasks to evaluate how well LLMs can utilize personal long-term memories in QA.

Key Contributions:
- PerLTQA dataset with rich semantic and episodic memories to enable personalized QA research.
- Memory classification, retrieval and synthesis tasks as a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance.
- Experiments showing BERT excels at memory classification while LLMs vary in ability to generate memory-based responses. 
- Analysis indicating both correct memory retrieval and presence of personal memory improve LLM response accuracy.

In summary, this paper makes available a comprehensive personal long-term memory QA dataset to facilitate research into more human-like memory recall and synthesis in conversational agents. The proposed framework of classifying, retrieving and integrating such memories is demonstrated to enhance LLM response quality.
