## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), which aims to classify known categories and discover new unknown categories in unlabeled data, using some labeled data from known categories. However, GCD suffers from two key issues: (1) Imbalanced performance between known and unknown classes, since known classes have some labeled data while unknown classes are fully unlabeled. (2) Inconsistent confidence scores between known and unknown categories. To address these issues, the paper proposes a new task called Active Generalized Category Discovery (AGCD).

Proposed Solution (AGCD):
In AGCD, models actively select a small number of valuable unlabeled samples to query labels from an oracle (human annotator). The newly labeled data is added to the training set to enhance model performance on unknown classes. Two key challenges in AGCD are: (1) Conventional active learning methods do not consider novel categories hence are not optimal. (2) Due to the clustering nature of GCD, the queried labels may not align with model predictions.

To address challenge (1), a novel adaptive sampling strategy "Adaptive-Novel" is proposed, which considers sample novelty, informativeness and diversity. It adaptively selects confident vs informative novel samples based on current model competence on novel classes. For challenge (2), a stable label mapping algorithm is devised to map ground truth labels to the model's label space by matching predictions on the labeled set.

Main Contributions:
(1) Proposes the new task of AGCD to address limitations of GCD using active annotation. 
(2) Adaptive-Novel sampling strategy to selectively query valuable novel samples.
(3) Stable label mapping to transform queried labels into model's label space.
(4) Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on GCD with minimal annotation cost. The approach effectively balances performance and confidence between known and novel classes.

In summary, the paper addresses key limitations of GCD by proposing the AGCD framework with adaptive sampling and label mapping. Experiments demonstrate significant gains over GCD baselines using minimal annotations of novel categories.
