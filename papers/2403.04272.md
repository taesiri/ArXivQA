# [Active Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), which aims to classify known categories and discover new unknown categories in unlabeled data, using some labeled data from known categories. However, GCD suffers from two key issues: (1) Imbalanced performance between known and unknown classes, since known classes have some labeled data while unknown classes are fully unlabeled. (2) Inconsistent confidence scores between known and unknown categories. To address these issues, the paper proposes a new task called Active Generalized Category Discovery (AGCD).

Proposed Solution (AGCD):
In AGCD, models actively select a small number of valuable unlabeled samples to query labels from an oracle (human annotator). The newly labeled data is added to the training set to enhance model performance on unknown classes. Two key challenges in AGCD are: (1) Conventional active learning methods do not consider novel categories hence are not optimal. (2) Due to the clustering nature of GCD, the queried labels may not align with model predictions.

To address challenge (1), a novel adaptive sampling strategy "Adaptive-Novel" is proposed, which considers sample novelty, informativeness and diversity. It adaptively selects confident vs informative novel samples based on current model competence on novel classes. For challenge (2), a stable label mapping algorithm is devised to map ground truth labels to the model's label space by matching predictions on the labeled set.

Main Contributions:
(1) Proposes the new task of AGCD to address limitations of GCD using active annotation. 
(2) Adaptive-Novel sampling strategy to selectively query valuable novel samples.
(3) Stable label mapping to transform queried labels into model's label space.
(4) Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on GCD with minimal annotation cost. The approach effectively balances performance and confidence between known and novel classes.

In summary, the paper addresses key limitations of GCD by proposing the AGCD framework with adaptive sampling and label mapping. Experiments demonstrate significant gains over GCD baselines using minimal annotations of novel categories.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new task called Active Generalized Category Discovery to address limitations in Generalized Category Discovery by actively selecting valuable novel samples for labeling from unlabeled data containing both old and new classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new task called Active Generalized Category Discovery (AGCD) to address the inherent and intractable issues of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), and establishing its pipeline and metrics. 

2. Proposing an adaptive query strategy called Adaptive-Novel to select valuable novel samples for labeling and address the problems of GCD with affordable budgets. This strategy jointly considers novelty, informativeness and diversity.

3. Devising a stable label mapping method to obtain credible mapping and alleviate the issue of different label ordering in clustering. 

4. Conducting extensive experiments showing the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among various strategies on generic and fine-grain datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the new AGCD task and the Adaptive-Novel strategy to actively query valuable samples to enhance the performance of GCD. The stable label mapping method also addresses a key challenge in AGCD.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Active Generalized Category Discovery (AGCD): The new task proposed to enhance performance of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by actively selecting samples to query labels from an oracle.

- Generalized Category Discovery (GCD): The task of jointly clustering unlabeled data containing both old classes (with some labeled samples) and new classes. 

- Novelty, informativeness, diversity: The three key aspects considered for sample selection in the proposed adaptive query strategy called Adaptive-Novel.

- Label mapping: The method proposed to transform ground truth labels of queried samples to the label space of the classifier model, due to inconsistent label ordering from clustering. 

- Imbalanced accuracy, inconsistent confidence: The inherent issues with GCD that AGCD aims to address, referring to the mismatch in performance and predictive confidence between old vs. new classes.

- Knowledge transfer, active learning: The underlying paradigms that inspire the formulation of AGCD.

In summary, the key concepts are around the new AGCD task for enhancing GCD, the adaptive query strategy considering multiple selection criteria, the label mapping method, and the notions of imbalanced accuracy and confidence that motivate moving from GCD to AGCD.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an adaptive sampling strategy called "Adaptive-Novel". What are the key aspects it considers for sample selection and why? How does the adaptiveness work?

2. The paper discusses two main challenges in the proposed AGCD task compared to conventional active learning. What are they and how does the method address these challenges?

3. Explain the stable label mapping algorithm proposed in the paper. Why is it needed and how does it work? What strategies are used to ensure stability?

4. Analyze the differences between confident novel samples and informative novel samples selected by the adaptive sampling strategy. When and why does the method switch between selecting these two types of samples?

5. The evaluation involves both accuracy metrics and novelty metrics. Explain what these different metrics measure and why they are all needed to fully evaluate the method's performance.

6. How does the proposed AGCD setting generalize conventional active learning to an open-world scenario? What are the key differences in the problem formulation?

7. The method is evaluated across both generic image datasets like CIFAR and fine-grained datasets. Analyze if there are any differences in the performance trends and discuss the reasons behind them.

8. Besides the adaptive sampling strategy, what are the other key components needed to implement the full AGCD pipeline proposed in the paper?

9. The paper uses the SimGCD method for training. Discuss the pros and cons of this choice over other GCD training methods. Are the gains observed dataset/method agnostic? 

10. The paper argues that some annotation of novel classes is necessary in GCD. Do the results and analyses provided fully validate this hypothesis? What are the limitations?
