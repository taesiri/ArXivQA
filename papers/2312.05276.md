# [Making Large Language Models Better Knowledge Miners for Online   Marketing with Progressive Prompting Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Constructing marketing-oriented knowledge graphs (MoKGs) is important for facilitating online marketing campaigns by matching user preferences to campaigns. 
- However, traditional knowledge graph construction relies heavily on manual labeling or multiple independent text mining models, which is expensive. 
- Large language models (LLMs) can encode useful knowledge but may generate unusable or incorrect relations when applied directly for MoKG construction.

Proposed Solution - PAIR Framework:
- Adaptive LLM-based relation filtering to constrain relation generation space.
- Progressive prompting augmentation of LLM for entity expansion using structural, descriptive and inherited knowledge.
- Reliable aggregation of expanded entities using self-consistency and semantic relatedness.  
- LightPAIR model specialized from PAIR using a smaller LLM fine-tuned on high-quality corpus from teacher LLM.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework, PAIR, for harvesting marketing-oriented knowledge graphs using careful prompting and steering of LLMs.
- Progressive prompting augmentation method to navigate LLMs to mine high-quality entities.
- Specialized LightPAIR model enabling efficient deployment.  
- Extensive experiments showing PAIR and LightPAIR outperform baselines in accuracy, novelty and diversity of mined MoKG.
- Demonstration of improved audience targeting in real marketing campaigns with LightPAIR.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective framework for constructing marketing-oriented knowledge graphs using large language models via careful prompting and steering techniques as well as a specialized light model for efficiency.
