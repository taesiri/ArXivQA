# [A Comprehensive View of the Biases of Toxicity and Sentiment Analysis   Methods Towards Utterances with African American English Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There has been an increase in the usage of African American English (AAE) expressions online. However, automatic content moderation tools and sentiment/toxicity analysis models may exhibit biases against utterances containing AAE. 
- These models score utterances with AAE expressions higher on toxicity or negative sentiment compared to semantically similar utterances without AAE. 
- The problem arises due to limited training data containing AAE and the difficulty in disambiguating the nuanced usage of certain expressions in AAE.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

- The paper investigates the biases of 6 widely used sentiment analysis and toxicity scoring models (Perspective, Detoxify, TextBlob, Vader, Flair) on 4 different datasets - Twitter, Youtube, CORAAL interviews and Buckeye interviews.

- A dictionary of over 1800 African American English expressions is manually compiled to study the bias quantitatively.

- Statistical analysis using logistic regression and semantic similarity comparisons are done to isolate impact of AAE expressions on model scores.

- Lexical models (TextBlob, Vader) exhibit lower bias than ML models (Perspective, Detoxify). But all models show some bias against AAE expressions, with evidence even in "unbiased" versions.

- The bias is most prominent in online textual datasets compared to spoken corpora. But it still exists across datasets and models.

- Key limitations are lack of ground truth race labels and potential unintended inferences. Findings aim to further research towards fairness, not against automated scoring.

In summary, the paper presents strong evidence for systematic racial bias in sentiment analysis and toxicity models against AAE dialect. Both rule-based and ML models are compared comprehensively across datasets to demonstrate this issue.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a broad-scale analysis of biases in toxicity and sentiment analysis methods towards utterances with African American English expressions across multiple datasets, finding that such biases are systemic, with machine learning models demonstrating higher degrees of bias than lexical models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper presents a broad-scale analysis of biases toward utterances with African American English (AAE) expressions in six well-known sentiment analysis and toxicity scoring models/APIs. Prior work has typically focused on smaller datasets or individual models.

2) The analysis employs four different datasets - Twitter, YouTube, CORAAL, and Buckeye - to understand when biases manifest more strongly. This includes both online/social media data as well as spoken English interviews.

3) In addition to examining the number of AAE expressions, the paper incorporates grammatical (PoS tagging) and linguistic (LIWC) features to isolate the effect of AAE usage on model scores. It also looks at semantic similarity using language models.

4) The results consistently show biases toward rating utterances with more AAE expressions as more negative or toxic across lexical and ML-based models. The paper discusses implications for system developers in choosing appropriate tools.

5) A dictionary of AAE expressions, curated from recommended sources, is made available to help improve future systems.

In summary, the key contribution is a much broader analysis, using multiple datasets and models, with additional lexical/grammatical controls, to demonstrate systematic biases against AAE expressions in sentiment and toxicity analysis.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the keywords associated with it are:

African American English, AAE, Bias, Toxicity, Sentiment

The paper focuses on studying potential biases towards utterances containing African American English (AAE) expressions in several toxicity and sentiment analysis models. The key research question is whether there is a systematic bias against AAE in such AI/ML models for content moderation. The keywords accurately summarize the key topics and focus areas of this research paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) What was the motivation behind creating a novel YouTube dataset of single-speaker movie reviews to analyze biases? How does this dataset help control for confounding variables compared to other datasets used in the study?

2) The paper employs a manual list of African American English (AAE) expressions from the Black Talk dictionary. Why was this particular dictionary chosen and how does a manual list mitigate issues with using an automated method? 

3) Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features are used as control variables in the statistical analyses. What is the purpose of using these grammatical and linguistic features in the regression models?

4) When comparing toxicity scores for utterances with and without AAE expressions, the authors find lexical approaches like Vader and TextBlob are less biased. Why would rule-based methods exhibit less bias than machine learning approaches?

5) For the semantic similarity analysis, utterance pairs are filtered to only those with diverging toxicity scores but high cosine similarity. What is the rationale behind this filtering process and what does it reveal about biases?

6) Across the different datasets analyzed, in what ways does the YouTube data provide improved control over potentially confounding variables compared to Twitter or the interview transcripts?

7) The regression analyses indicate features like swear words and sexual content are predictive of toxic scores. How do these features interact with or potentially obscure biases related to AAE expressions?  

8) For developers or users of toxicity scoring systems, what guidelines or takeaways are provided in the paper regarding model selection and threshold cutoffs?

9) How do the limitations discussed around sampling strategy and observational data impact the conclusions that can be drawn from the study? What steps were taken to mitigate these concerns?

10) What suggestions are made regarding next steps to continue improving automatic moderation systems and mitigate biases related to dialects like African American English?
