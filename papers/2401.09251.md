# [Bridging the Gap Between General and Down-Closed Convex Sets in   Submodular Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers the problem of maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular functions subject to general (not necessarily down-closed) convex constraints. This problem arises in many real-world applications but is challenging to approximate.

- Prior works parameterized the hardness of the problem based on the minimum l∞ norm (denoted by m) of any feasible solution. However, this does not provide a smooth interpolation between down-closed and general convex constraints. 

- The paper aims to provide an improved interpolation based on decomposing the convex constraint into a down-closed part (DM) and a general part (NDM).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes novel offline and online algorithms that maintain two solutions - y in NDM using the Frank-Wolfe style update of [23] and z in DM using the continuous greedy style update of [3]. 

- A key challenge is combining y and z into the output solution. Using y+z grows too fast, so the probabilistic sum y ⊕ z is used instead. This requires handling a new discretization error term.

- The offline algorithm is analyzed to show it recovers the best prior guarantees for down-closed and general constraints, and smoothly interpolates based on the value of the optimal solution belonging to DM.

- The online algorithm incorporates a potential function to eliminate the need for knowledge of the offline optimal, and achieves low regret compared to the optimal y,z solutions.

Main Contributions:
- First algorithms for non-monotone DR-submodular maximization that provide smooth interpolation between down-closed and general convex constraints.

- Novel offline algorithm with approximation guarantee depending on decomposition into DM and NDM. Recovers ratios of [3] and [23].

- Novel online algorithm building on a potential function, eliminating need for offline optimum knowledge. 

- Empirical evaluation showing superiority over prior approaches on offline and online revenue maximization, location summarization, and quadratic programming tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents novel offline and online algorithms for maximizing non-monotone continuous submodular functions over general convex constraints by decomposing the constraint set into a down-closed convex set and a general convex set to smoothly interpolate between the better approximability of down-closed constraints and the weaker guarantees for general constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing novel offline and online algorithms for maximizing non-monotone continuous submodular functions subject to a general convex body constraint. The key idea is to decompose the convex body constraint into a down-closed convex body and a general convex body, which allows the algorithms to interpolate smoothly between the approximation guarantees for down-closed and general convex bodies. Specifically, the paper:

1) Presents an offline algorithm that recovers the best known approximations for down-closed constraints as well as general constraints as special cases, and provides approximation guarantees that depend on the relative contribution of the down-closed and general components. 

2) Provides an online regret minimization algorithm with similar interpolation properties between down-closed and general constraints, up to an additional regret term.

3) Demonstrates the applicability of the convex body decomposition idea and the superiority of the proposed algorithms over prior methods on several machine learning tasks like revenue maximization, location summarization, and quadratic programming.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the convex body decomposition technique to obtain the first offline and online algorithms for non-monotone continuous submodular maximization that smoothly interpolate between down-closed and general constraints.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- DR-submodular maximization - The paper studies the optimization/maximization of DR-submodular functions, which are continuous analogs of submodular set functions. This is a key focus.

- General convex body constraints - Much of the work is aimed at handling DR-submodular maximization subject to general (not necessarily down-closed) convex body constraints. 

- Down-closed convex bodies - The techniques in the paper provide a smooth interpolation between down-closed convex bodies (which are easier to handle) and general convex bodies.

- Offline and online algorithms - Both offline (one-shot) and online (regret minimization) algorithms are developed.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes decomposing the convex body constraint into a down-closed convex body and a general convex body. What is the intuition behind this decomposition? How does it help provide a smooth interpolation between down-closed and general convex bodies?

2) The offline algorithm maintains two vectors - y from the general convex body and z from the down-closed convex body. What is the rationale behind maintaining two separate vectors and combining them using a probabilistic sum? What are the tradeoffs compared to simply using y+z?

3) The potential function used for analysis seems crucial for bounding the guarantees without knowing F(optp). Can you explain the intuition behind the form of this potential function? How does it capture progress towards optimizing both F(y) and F(z)?  

4) The paper proves the result for a fixed ts initially and then shows the final guarantee via enumeration over ts values. Can you think of a way to avoid this enumeration and directly optimize over ts in the algorithm? What changes would be needed?

5) How does the online algorithm deal with the credit assignment problem across the multiple instances of online linear optimization? Why can't we simply use their solutions rather than feeding gradients as adversarial vectors?

6) The practical offline algorithm makes some changes like using vc to allow decreasing z coordinates. What is the motivation behind this? Does it improve empirical performance?

7) Under what conditions will the guarantees match the special cases of purely down-closed bodies or general bodies? Can you geometrically interpret the approximation ratios in those limits?

8) What types of structure in the constraints can we exploit to get improved decompositions? For instance linear constraints, simplicial constraints etc.

9) The technique uses a variable ts to control the tradeoff between the down-closed and general steps. Can we adaptively change this over the course of the algorithm’s execution? 

10) Are there other problems in submodular optimization that could benefit from this decomposition-based technique? What challenges might arise in extending the approach?
