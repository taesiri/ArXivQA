# [Background Clustering Pre-training for Few-shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03322)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new pre-training scheme called Background Clustering Pre-Training (BCPT) to improve few-shot segmentation (FSS) performance. Current pre-training methods suffer from a "merged background" problem where novel classes are incorrectly learned as background. To address this, BCPT uses online clustering to decouple novel classes from the background by exploring underlying semantic structures during pre-training. Specifically, multiple cluster centers are learned to capture the diversity of novel classes and background. Furthermore, base classes are used to guide the clustering process to achieve more accurate results. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i benchmarks demonstrate that BCPT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, with a ResNet-50 backbone, BCPT achieves 66.87% and 71.21% mean IoU on PASCAL-5i under 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed guided clustering strategy and learning paradigm. Overall, by explicitly tackling the merged background problem in current pre-training, BCPT is shown to learn more discriminative features for few-shot segmentation.
