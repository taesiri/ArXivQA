# [IPCC-TP: Utilizing Incremental Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Joint   Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00575)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we model multi-agent interactions more effectively for multi-agent trajectory prediction? The key ideas and contributions are:- The authors propose a new concept called Incremental Pearson Correlation Coefficient (IPCC) to model the relevance of agents' incremental movements. This captures the interaction patterns between agents in a compact and intuitive manner.- They design a module called IPCC-TP that can generate joint probability distributions over multi-agent futures by estimating coupled means and covariances based on IPCC. - IPCC-TP can be conveniently plugged into existing multi-agent prediction methods to boost their performance.- Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse datasets show that embedding IPCC-TP improves state-of-the-art methods considerably by enabling better modeling of interactions.In summary, the paper introduces a novel and interpretable way to encode agent interactions via incremental movements, and shows this can enhance multi-agent trajectory prediction when incorporated into strong baseline methods. The central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling motion relevance is beneficial for this task.
