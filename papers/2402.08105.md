# [Learning Cartesian Product Graphs with Laplacian Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of learning Cartesian product graphs from multi-way graph signals. Cartesian product graphs are useful for modeling higher-order dependencies in multi-dimensional data. The goal is to learn the underlying factor graphs and their Cartesian product given graph signals defined on the nodes of the product graph. This is important for generalizing graph signal processing to tensor data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes to formulate this problem as the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of a Cartesian product improper Gaussian Markov random field (IGMRF) model. This makes use of Laplacian constraints on the precision matrix to enforce positive dependencies and connectivity of the learned graphs. The paper further derives an efficient algorithm, termed MWGL, to solve this problem by exploiting properties of the Cartesian product graph Laplacian. MWGL optimizes the factor graphs separately using projected gradient descent.

An extension MWGL-Missing is also proposed for joint graph learning and missing value imputation under structural missingness. This iterates graph learning steps from MWGL with imputation steps using Tikhonov filtering.

Main Contributions:

- Establishes statistical consistency guarantees and improved rates of convergence for learning Cartesian product graph Laplacians using penalized MLE.

- Proposes the efficient MWGL algorithm to solve the penalized MLE problem by reducing computational complexity from cubic in total size to cubic in factor sizes.

- Extends MWGL to handle missing values and enable joint graph learning and imputation.

- Demonstrates superior performance over previous graph signal processing and Gaussian graphical model baselines on both synthetic and real-world multi-way datasets.

In summary, the paper provides an important theoretical analysis and efficient method for learning underlying factor graphs from tensor data by exploiting the Cartesian product structure. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the approach.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors are the first to consider the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of Cartesian product Laplacian learning, and establish theoretical results on its asymptotic consistency.

2. They propose an efficient algorithm called MWGL to solve the penalized MLE problem, which reduces the computational complexity compared to the naive solution. They also extend this algorithm to handle structural missing data (MWGL-Missing).
