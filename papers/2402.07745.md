# [Predictive Churn with the Set of Good Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of unstable or inconsistent predictions that machine learning models can make over time. Specifically, it looks at two types of instability - (1) Predictive churn: Changes in individual predictions when a model is updated or retrained over time. (2) Predictive multiplicity: The existence of multiple near-optimal models that make conflicting predictions on the same data points. 

The paper argues that both types of instability can lead to arbitrary and potentially unfair decisions if model predictions directly inform actions like loan approvals. Therefore, it is important to analyze and anticipate instability.

Main Contributions:

1. The paper shows empirically that examples prone to churn (prediction change from model update) overlap significantly with examples prone to multiplicity (prediction change over near-optimal models). Thus, analyzing multiplicity of an initial model can help gauge severity of potential future churn.

2. It provides theoretical analysis bounding churn between models from the "Rashomon set" - the set of near-optimal models. This shows formally how churn depends jointly on properties of the model and the data pipeline.  

3. The paper evaluates an uncertainty-aware model on real datasets. It shows the uncertainty estimates help identify examples prone to instability from both churn and multiplicity perspectives. However, the uncertainty model itself can exhibit even higher rates of multiplicity.

Proposed Solution:
The main proposal is using predictive multiplicity analysis to anticipate, reduce and avoid churn in applications where stability is important for safety and fairness. For example, when selecting an initial model for deployment, evaluate the Rashomon set to choose the model likely to incur lowest churn from future updates. The theoretical and empirical analyses support the feasibility of this approach.

In summary, the paper provides both theoretical grounding and practical demonstrations that connecting predictive multiplicity and predictive churn can improve reliability and trust in machine learning systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper examines the relationship between predictive multiplicity (the prevalence of conflicting predictions from a set of near-optimal models) and predictive churn (changes in individual predictions when a model is updated over time), proposing the analysis of the former as a useful technique to anticipate the likelihood and severity of the latter in applied machine learning systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. Examining whether individual predictions that are unstable under model perturbations (multiplicity) are also those that are unstable under dataset perturbations (churn). The paper compares between examples that are $\epsilon$-Rashomon \emph{unstable} and \emph{churn unstable} and finds that the  $\epsilon$-Rashomon \emph{unstable} set does often contain most examples within the \emph{churn unstable} set. This suggests that analyzing predictive multiplicity can help anticipate predictive churn.

2. Theoretically characterizing the expected churn between models within the $\epsilon$-Rashomon set from different perspectives. The analysis reveals that the potential for reducing churn by substituting the deployed model with an alternative from the $\epsilon$-Rashomon set depends on the training procedure used to generate the $\epsilon$-Rashomon set. 

3. Presenting empirical results showing that analyzing predictive multiplicity is useful for anticipating churn even for models enhanced with uncertainty awareness. The paper examines whether inherent uncertainty quantification abilities in models might help indicate which examples will be $\epsilon$-Rashomon or churn unstable. The findings show that while an uncertainty aware model can exhibit more predictive multiplicity, the uncertainty estimates do prove helpful in anticipating unstable instances.

In summary, the main contribution is using predictive multiplicity analysis and the $\epsilon$-Rashomon set perspective to gain insights about anticipating, reducing, and avoiding predictive churn in machine learning models over time.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Predictive churn - The amount of change in individual predictions between an original model and an updated model. Quantified by the proportion of predictions that "flip".

- Predictive multiplicity - The prevalence of conflicting predictions over the set of near-optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. Captured through metrics like ambiguity and discrepancy. 

- Rashomon set - The set of competing models that have near equal performance to the selected model. 

- Ambiguity - The proportion of examples assigned conflicting predictions over the Rashomon set. Quantifies sensitivity of predictions.

- Discrepancy - The maximum proportion of prediction conflicts caused by swapping the baseline model for another model in the Rashomon set.

- Unstable sets - The sets of examples prone to flipping predictions, either due to model updates (churn unstable set) or due to the Rashomon set (Rashomon unstable set).

- Uncertainty awareness - Techniques like Bayesian neural networks and ensemble methods that produce uncertainty estimates along with predictions.

The key focus is on using the Rashomon set and predictive multiplicity to analyze and anticipate predictive churn over model updates. The unstable sets connect multiplicity and churn. Uncertainty estimation is also explored as a method for identifying unstable examples.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using predictive multiplicity analysis on the initial model deployment to anticipate future predictive churn. What are some limitations of this approach? For instance, are there cases where high initial multiplicity would not translate to high churn or vice versa?

2. The paper examines the relationship between the $\epsilon$-Rashomon unstable set and the churn unstable set. What other set comparisons could provide additional insights into the connection between multiplicity and churn?

3. The paper theoretically shows that expected churn between models within the $\epsilon$-Rashomon set depends greatly on how the set was constructed. What are some alternative theoretical results we could derive about churn and multiplicity? 

4. The spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process (SNGP) is used as the uncertainty-aware model. How might using other uncertainty quantification methods like MC Dropout or deep ensembles impact the results?

5. Could the relationship between uncertainty estimates and instability sets be strengthened? What modifications to the SNGP method might better highlight unstable examples?  

6. The paper focuses on predictive churn induced by model updates. What about concept drift - how might continuously changing data distributions over time affect the analysis?

7. What other practical use cases could this combined multiplicity and churn perspective enable? For instance, monitoring and bounding churn over time.

8. How well would these methods transfer to other modalities like image, text, or time series data? What adjustments would need to be made?

9. The paper examines classification tasks exclusively. How would the analysis differ for regression problems?

10. What are some ways to scale computations to enable efficient analysis of massive datasets with billions of examples? Could methods like coresets help tractably approximate the unstable sets?
