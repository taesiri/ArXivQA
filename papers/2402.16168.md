# [Hitting "Probe"rty with Non-Linearity, and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Structural probes learn a linear transformation to analyze how dependency trees are encoded in language model representations. However, this simple linear design may not fully capture the complex syntactic structure.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce non-linear structural probes to better model the complex dependency structure: Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoid probes.
- Reformulate the non-linear probe design to have a simpler yet effective formulation compared to prior work.  
- Propose a visualization method to qualitatively assess the strength of predicted dependencies.

Experiments:
- Apply linear and non-linear probes to BERT and BERT-Large models. 
- Find RBF probe has consistently higher performance than other probes, outperforming the linear probe.
- Visualizations show RBF makes more correct predictions with higher strength compared to linear probe.

Analysis and Observations:
- RBF is better than linear probe at exploiting syntactic structure. 
- UUAS score alone insufficient to evaluate probes, should account for false positive edges.
- BERT encodes syntax gradually across layers - initial layers capture local relationships, middle layers form most syntactic connections, final layers make more selective predictions.  
- Contextualized representations encode syntax better than non-contextualized word embeddings.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate superior ability of non-linear RBF probe over linear probe
- Qualitative visualization method to understand probe predictions
- Analysis of how BERT's representations encode syntax across layers
- Simplified formulation of non-linear structural probes

In summary, the paper shows non-linear probes, especially RBF, better capture complex syntactic structure than linear probes. The visual analysis provides insights into how probes encode dependencies and how syntax emerges across BERT's layers.
