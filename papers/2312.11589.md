# [Moral Uncertainty and the Problem of Fanaticism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is widespread moral disagreement in society about what constitutes ethical behavior. To address this, the approach of "moral uncertainty" proposes aggregating multiple ethical theories to guide agent behavior.  
- However, a foundational proposal called Maximizing Expected Choiceworthiness (MEC) has been criticized as vulnerable to "fanaticism". This is where an ethical theory can dominate agent behavior despite having low credibility, undermining the motivation to accommodate multiple perspectives.
- Fanaticism has not been clearly defined mathematically. Also, no convincing alternatives to MEC have been proposed.

Proposed Solution:
- Formalize moral uncertainty as an instance of social welfare aggregation, with ethical theories as individuals and credences as weights. 
- Formally define fanaticism as a property of social welfare functionals, specifying precisely what it means for a low-credence theory to "dominate".
- Define non-fanatical alternatives to MEC: Weighted k-Trimmed Highest Mean and Weighted Highest Median. These trim away extreme ethical evaluations.

Contributions:
1) Provide a mathematical definition of fanaticism in terms of dominant theory subsets.
2) Define novel, weighted versions of standard welfare functionals to reduce fanaticism. 
3) Prove that MEC is maximally fanaticism ("Pascalian" fanaticism).
4) Prove the proposed alternatives avoid Pascalian fanaticism to different degrees. Weighted Highest Median completely avoids fanaticism.
5) Argue for replacing MEC with the less fanatical welfare functionals.

In summary, this paper makes important theoretical contributions by formally defining and providing mathematical alternatives to the problem of fanaticism in moral uncertainty. The proposed welfare functionals help avoid the issue of low-credence theories dominating agent behavior.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper formally defines and analyzes the problem of fanaticism in moral uncertainty, proving that methods like Maximizing Expected Choiceworthiness are maximally vulnerable while proposing less fanatical alternatives like weighted k-Trimmed Highest Mean and weighted Highest Median.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It formally defines fanaticism as a property of social welfare functionals (swfs) used for moral uncertainty. Specifically, it defines fanaticism in terms of dominant subsets - subsets of ethical theories that solely determine the overall ranking of actions. 

2) It defines novel, weighted versions of the swfs k-Trimmed Highest Mean and Highest Median as less fanatical alternatives to Maximising Expected Choiceworthiness (MEC), the standard approach to moral uncertainty.

3) It proves that MEC is maximally fanatical ('Pascalian' fanatical). It also proves that the proposed k-Trimmed Highest Mean is partially fanatical, while Highest Median completely avoids fanaticism.

In summary, the paper provides a formal critique of MEC's vulnerability to fanaticism, proposes less fanatical alternatives, and mathematically analyzes their extent of fanaticism. This contributes formal definitions and results to the growing field of moral uncertainty.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Moral uncertainty - The paper focuses on approaches for making decisions under moral uncertainty, when there is disagreement over what constitutes ethical behavior. 

- Maximising expected choiceworthiness (MEC) - An influential approach for resolving moral uncertainty that aggregates different ethical perspectives. However, it is vulnerable to the problem of fanaticism.

- Fanaticism - The problem where an ethical theory can dominate decision making despite having low acceptance/credence. The paper formally defines fanaticism for the first time.  

- Social welfare aggregation - The paper models moral uncertainty as an instance of social welfare aggregation, with ethical theories as individuals. This allows application of concepts like social welfare functionals.

- Weighted alternatives - The paper proposes less fanatical, weighted versions of social welfare functionals like k-Trimmed Highest Mean and Highest Median as alternatives to MEC.

- Formal proofs - Key results are formally proven concerning the extent to which certain methods like MEC, Maximin, k-Trimmed Highest Mean and Highest Median are vulnerable to fanaticism.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around moral uncertainty, fanaticism in decision making, and weighted social welfare aggregation methods. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper defines fanaticism in terms of dominant subsets of ethical theories. How sensitive is this definition to the precise threshold set for determining when a subset is dominant? Could minor variations in the threshold still capture the core intuition behind fanaticism?

2. The paper proposes the k-trimmed highest mean and weighted median as less fanatical alternatives to maximizing expected choiceworthiness (MEC). However, do these alternatives fail to capture certain morally relevant features that MEC encodes, such as sensitivity to the magnitude of ethical stakes? 

3. The weighted median is shown to completely avoid fanaticism. However, is there a risk that by avoiding sensitivity to outlier evaluations, the weighted median fails to respond to genuine and morally concerning edge cases? How could the method identify and handle such cases?  

4. The proof showing that MEC is Pascalian fanatical relies on constructing an ethical theory $\mathit{ft}$ that dominates due to extreme evaluations on all actions. How dependent is this result on the assumption that $\mathit{ft}$ can evaluate all actions? Would restricting the scope of $\mathit{ft}$ change the conclusions?

5. The parameter $k$ balances stakes-sensitivity and non-fanaticism for the k-trimmed method. Is there a principled and domain-general method for setting $k$, or will its value likely be context-dependent? If context-dependent, what considerations should drive the value assignment?

6. The ratio-scale measurability and interpersonal comparability (RFC) assumption plays an important role. How would fanaticism need to be redefined under weaker assumptions like ordinal measurability? Would the results still hold?

7. Social choice theory encodes different informational assumptions about welfare comparisons. How might the results change if richer informational assumptions are made, allowing finer-grained comparisons between ethical theories' evaluations?

8. The paper focuses on choiceworthiness aggregation for moral uncertainty. Can the definitions and results be extended to other theories like reflection aggregation or moral parliament? Would new axioms be needed to handle voting-style procedures?

9. The framing centers on ethical theories providing evaluations. Does defining fanaticism and alternate methods require substantial changes if other representational frameworks like sets of moral principles or rules are used instead?

10. The results show maximal and complete avoidance of fanaticism for certain methods. Is it possible to quantify degrees of non-fanaticism, providing a smoother scale for comparing methods? What mathematical properties would be involved?
