# [Moral Uncertainty and the Problem of Fanaticism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is widespread moral disagreement in society about what constitutes ethical behavior. To address this, the approach of "moral uncertainty" proposes aggregating multiple ethical theories to guide agent behavior.  
- However, a foundational proposal called Maximizing Expected Choiceworthiness (MEC) has been criticized as vulnerable to "fanaticism". This is where an ethical theory can dominate agent behavior despite having low credibility, undermining the motivation to accommodate multiple perspectives.
- Fanaticism has not been clearly defined mathematically. Also, no convincing alternatives to MEC have been proposed.

Proposed Solution:
- Formalize moral uncertainty as an instance of social welfare aggregation, with ethical theories as individuals and credences as weights. 
- Formally define fanaticism as a property of social welfare functionals, specifying precisely what it means for a low-credence theory to "dominate".
- Define non-fanatical alternatives to MEC: Weighted k-Trimmed Highest Mean and Weighted Highest Median. These trim away extreme ethical evaluations.

Contributions:
1) Provide a mathematical definition of fanaticism in terms of dominant theory subsets.
2) Define novel, weighted versions of standard welfare functionals to reduce fanaticism. 
3) Prove that MEC is maximally fanaticism ("Pascalian" fanaticism).
4) Prove the proposed alternatives avoid Pascalian fanaticism to different degrees. Weighted Highest Median completely avoids fanaticism.
5) Argue for replacing MEC with the less fanatical welfare functionals.

In summary, this paper makes important theoretical contributions by formally defining and providing mathematical alternatives to the problem of fanaticism in moral uncertainty. The proposed welfare functionals help avoid the issue of low-credence theories dominating agent behavior.
