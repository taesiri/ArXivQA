# [Annotation-Efficient Polyp Segmentation via Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Polyp segmentation is important for detecting and treating colorectal cancer early, but requires extensive pixel-wise manual annotation which is expensive. 
- Existing deep learning methods rely on large labeled datasets which are costly to obtain.

Proposed Solution:
- An active learning framework to minimize annotation costs by selectively sampling the most valuable data to label. 
- A sampling strategy that jointly considers uncertainty (via feature similarity of polyp and background) as well as diversity (via weighted clustering) to pick informative and representative samples.
- An unsupervised feature discrepancy loss to enhance segmentation network's features and improve sampling robustness.

Main Contributions:
- A novel uncertainty-weighted clustering algorithm that actively queries samples that are both uncertain and representative.
- An unsupervised feature discrepancy learning approach that magnifies differentiation between polyp and background features to better discern valuable samples.
- State-of-the-art performance compared to other methods on both a public dataset and large-scale in-house dataset, with over 1% gain.
- Effectiveness even in low annotation budget regimes via enhanced feature representations.

In summary, the paper proposes an active learning framework with an innovative sampling strategy and unsupervised learning component to minimize annotation costs for polyp segmentation while achieving better performance than other methods.
