# [Enhancing Hokkien Dual Translation by Exploring and Standardizing of   Four Writing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation (MT) models predominantly cater to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English and Mandarin Chinese, while low-resource languages (LRLs) like Taiwanese Hokkien are relatively under-explored. 
- Taiwanese Hokkien faces issues due to lack of standardized writing systems, introduction of inconsistent corpus, and scarcity of parallel datasets. These hinder the development of translation models.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a dual translation model between Taiwanese Hokkien and both Traditional Mandarin Chinese and English using a pre-trained LLaMA model specialized in Traditional Mandarin Chinese.
- Leverage orthographic similarities between Taiwanese Hokkien Han and Traditional Mandarin Chinese.
- Conduct comprehensive experiments involving translation tasks across various writing systems of Taiwanese Hokkien and between Taiwanese Hokkien and other HRLs.
- Explore impact of using limited monolingual corpus and parallel datasets on model's capabilities.
- Standardize all Taiwanese Hokkien writing systems into Hokkien Han prior to continued pre-training to further improve performance.
- Introduce back-translation method and incorporate GPT-4 for reliable automatic evaluation even for LRLs.

Main Contributions:
- Develop and release first dual translation model for Taiwanese Hokkien to bridge gap between this low-resource language and other HRLs.
- Provide empirical evidence to support enhancement of model performance through monolingual corpora in addition to parallel data. 
- Standardization of Taiwanese Hokkien monolingual corpora into Han led to performance improvements in HAN, English and Mandarin Chinese translations.
- Introduce back-translation of LRL into HRL for GPT prompt-based evaluation to ensure reliable quality assessment.

In summary, the paper explores strategies like leveraging language similarities, standardized corpus, and model tuning to develop a robust Taiwanese Hokkien translation system involving diverse writing systems and bridging capability gaps with English and Mandarin Chinese.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops and evaluates neural machine translation models between Taiwanese Hokkien and Mandarin Chinese/English by leveraging large language models pre-trained on Mandarin Chinese and fine-tuning on parallel corpora, with a focus on enhancing translation involving the low-resource Hokkien language.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Develop and release the first dual translation model for Taiwanese Hokkien, thereby narrowing the resource gap for this low-resource language.

2. Provide empirical evidence to support the enhancement of model performance through monolingual corpora on top of parallel data. 

3. Standardize all Taiwanese Hokkien monolingual corpora into Hokkien Han (HAN) prior to continued pre-training, leading to performance enhancements in translations among Mandarin Chinese, English, and HAN.

4. Introduce back-translation of the low-resource language into a high-resource language for GPT prompt-based evaluation.

In summary, the paper focuses on developing translation capabilities for the low-resource Taiwanese Hokkien language by leveraging monolingual and parallel datasets, standardizing writing systems, and evaluating with back-translation and GPT prompts. This helps address the lack of resources and models available for Taiwanese Hokkien translation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes the LLaMA 2 model as a foundation and conducts continued pre-training on Taiwanese Hokkien data. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a high-resource language model pre-trained on Mandarin Chinese as the base model for a low-resource language like Taiwanese Hokkien?

2. The study explores the impact of using monolingual Hokkien data from different writing systems during continued pre-training. What are some potential challenges in processing and standardizing such heterogeneous textual data? How may it impact model performance? 

3. The paper examines the effect of vocabulary extension on model performance but did not find clear improvements. What factors need to be considered regarding optimal approaches for vocabulary expansion when working with low-resource languages?

4. What are the trade-offs between solely using monolingual data versus parallel data during continued pre-training for low-resource neural machine translation? Under what conditions might one approach be preferred over the other? 

5. The model performance varies substantially across different translation directions. What factors might account for particularly strong or weak performance for specific translation pairs? How can problematic translation directions be further improved?

6. The paper proposes a methodology to standardize all Taiwanese Hokkien writing systems to Han characters. What steps are involved in developing a script conversion pipeline robust enough to handle real-world low-resource language data?

7. The study utilizes chrF++ in addition to BLEU for automatic evaluation. Why might chrF++ be better suited for assessing translation quality for phonetic writing systems? What other metrics could complement these?

8. How suitable are large language model-based techniques like GPT-4 for evaluating low-resource language translations? What modifications need to be made to prompt engineering for reliable assessments?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on translation tasks. How might the proposed methods need to be adapted for other NLP tasks involving Taiwanese Hokkien, such as sentiment analysis or speech recognition?

10. What ethical considerations need to be made when developing NLP tools for minority languages with limited textual resources? How can model biases be minimized?
