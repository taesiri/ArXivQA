# [Let's Rectify Step by Step: Improving Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis   with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to extract aspect terms from text and classify their sentiment polarities. However, precisely determining the boundaries (start and end indices) of aspect terms is challenging, especially for long aspect terms, due to the diversity of language expressions. 

Proposed Solution - DiffusionABSA:
The paper proposes DiffusionABSA, a novel framework that adapts diffusion models to refine the aspects progressively through corruption and denoising processes. 

Key Features:
- Corruption process: Gradually adds Gaussian noise to the aspect terms to model the corruption of information.  
- Denoising process: Learns to reverse the corruption by restoring the original aspect terms step-by-step. A denoising neural network enhanced with a syntax-aware temporal attention mechanism is designed for this.
- Syntax-aware Temporal Attention (SynTA): Captures the interactions between aspects and text syntax structures over time steps. Incorporates POS tags, dependency trees and time embeddings.
- Aspect Extractor & Sentiment Classifier: Predict boundaries and sentiment polarities based on the sentence representations from SynTA.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes DiffusionABSA that adapts diffusion models to ABSA by modeling aspects progressively via corruption and denoising.
- Designs a denoising neural network enhanced with SynTA to capture aspect-text syntactical interactions over time.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on 8 datasets, outperforming strong baselines including ChatGPT. Shows superior ability in extracting long aspect terms.
