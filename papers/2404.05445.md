# [Unsupervised Training of Convex Regularizers using Maximum Likelihood   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image reconstruction tasks like denoising and deblurring are ill-posed inverse problems that require regularization for stable solutions. Common regularizers are handcrafted priors like total variation (TV) or learned end-to-end mappings. 
- End-to-end learned mappings require paired supervised data of clean and noisy images. Recent works have looked at unsupervised and self-supervised approaches but they have limitations.
- This paper focuses on unsupervised learning of convex neural network based regularizers using only single copies of corrupted data. This is more challenging than methods that assume access to multiple noisy copies. 

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate image reconstruction as MAP inference in a Bayesian model with learned prior $p(x|\theta)$ parameterized by $\theta$.
- Marginalize the posterior $p(x|y,\theta)$ over $x$ to get the marginal likelihood $p(y|\theta)$. 
- Maximize $p(y|\theta)$ w.r.t. $\theta$ using stochastic gradient ascent. The gradient can be estimated from two MCMC chains targeting the prior and posterior.
- Use Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) based Markov chains, modified to project or reflect samples back into feasible set.
- Extend the algorithm to minibatches for scaling to larger datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Method for unsupervised learning of convex neural network priors using maximum likelihood estimation from only single noisy copies.
- Convergence guarantees for proposed reflected ULA-based Markov chains.
- Experiments on Gaussian deconvolution and Poisson denoising comparing against supervised and self-supervised baselines.
- Reasonably small performance gap between proposed unsupervised method and supervised adversarial training baseline.
- Better generalization than end-to-end learned mappings when corruption changes at test time.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework for image reconstruction that can work from limited data and learns interpretable convex priors. The method is supported by convergence guarantees and shown to be competitive or better than existing techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised method for training a convex neural network image prior using only single copies of corrupted data, based on an efficient stochastic gradient method; experiments show the method produces competitive results compared to supervised training and better generalization than end-to-end approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing an unsupervised method to train a convex neural network based image prior using only single copies of corrupted data. This allows learning an image prior without access to clean data.

2) Extending the stochastic approximate proximal gradient (SAPG) algorithm to handle a parameterization with significantly more parameters compared to prior works that considered simpler total variation priors. The proposed method trains a convex ridge regularizer with around 15.5K parameters.

3) Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed unsupervised training method produces priors that are competitive compared to a supervised adversarial training method on tasks like Gaussian deconvolution and Poisson denoising. The learned priors also generalize better than end-to-end methods.

4) Presenting convergence theory for the proposed reflected Markov chains used in the SAPG algorithm, showing they converge to the constrained posterior and prior even when using a non-convex neural network architecture for the image prior.

In summary, the main contribution is an unsupervised training framework to learn expressive convex neural network priors using only corrupted data, with competitive performance and better generalization compared to alternatives.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an unsupervised training method for learning convex regularizers using only noisy data. How does this compare to other unsupervised methods like Noise2Noise or methods that require clean data like adversarial training? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

2. The key idea in the proposed method is to jointly sample from the prior and posterior distributions using MCMC methods. Explain the intuition behind why this allows estimating the gradient of the marginal likelihood for learning the parameters of the regularizer. What are some challenges with using MCMC for high dimensional problems?

3. The paper uses the Stochastic Approximate Proximal Gradient (SAPG) algorithm to optimize the parameters of the regularizer. Explain how the gradient estimates are obtained in SAPG and why using only a single sample (m=1) per iteration is enough for convergence.

4. The paper proposes modifications like batching and reflecting MCMC chains to deal with large datasets and handle constraints like non-negativity. Analyze the impact of these changes on the convergence guarantees and sample quality from the chains.

5. A convex neural network (ConvexNN) parametrization is used for the regularizers in the experiments. Discuss the representational capacity and regularization properties of ConvexNNs compared to standard NNs. How do these properties impact learning and reconstruction quality?

6. Analyze the differences between common regularizers like total variation vs learned regularizers in terms of reconstruction quality and flexibility across tasks and datasets. What types of artifacts can appear?

7. The method is experimented on Gaussian denoising and Poisson denoising tasks. Compare and contrast the objective functions and implementation challenges between these tasks. How might the method perform on other inverse problems?

8. Discuss the transferability of the learned regularizers to different forward operators as analyzed in the uniform deconvolution experiments. Should we expect similar robustness for other corruption types and degrees?

9. The comparisons are made to methods like equivariant imaging and deep image priors. Critically analyze the pros and cons of these methods vs the proposed approach. When might you prefer one over the other?

10. The paper demonstrates unsupervised learning for image reconstruction. Discuss how the key ideas can be extended to other domains like graphs and point clouds. What components would need to be adapted?
