# [Identifying architectural design decisions for achieving green ML   serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is increasing concern about the computational demands and environmental impact of large machine learning (ML) models, especially during inference (where models make predictions). 
- The process of deploying ML models for user access, known as "ML serving", is critical for efficiency but understudied. 
- Architectural decisions can significantly impact the efficiency and sustainability of ML systems, but current methods do not adequately consider optimizing ML systems like ML serving for efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a literature analysis to identify key architectural design decisions (ADDs) for ML serving and analyze associated quality characteristics studied, with a focus on efficiency.  

Key Findings:
- Identified one main ADD - the "serving infrastructure" - with 4 options: no runtime engine, runtime engine, DL-specific software, cloud ML service.
- Additional "transversal" ADDs depend on serving infra: containerization method, model format, request processing, communication protocol.
- Studies focus mostly on performance efficiency of ADDs, lacking analysis of energy efficiency and environmental impact.

Contributions:  
- Identified and categorized ML serving ADDs and technological components.
- Provided overview of quality characteristics studied for each ADD - highlighted that energy efficiency is currently under-studied.
- Laid groundwork to conduct deeper analysis of efficiency and guide selection of green ML serving ADDs.

The paper makes an important first step in analyzing ML serving ADDs to build more efficient and sustainable ML systems, though more research is needed on the relationship between ADDs and environmental impact.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies and analyzes the architectural design decisions for machine learning serving systems, focusing on understanding their components, quality characteristics, and research opportunities to improve energy efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's abstract, introduction, and conclusion, the main contribution of this paper is:

The identification and classification of architectural design decisions for machine learning serving systems, with a focus on analyzing their quality characteristics, especially energy efficiency. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Identifying the main architectural design decision of ML serving systems as the serving infrastructure, with 4 options: no runtime engine, runtime engine, DL-specific software, and cloud service.

2) Identifying additional "transversal" design decisions that depend on the serving infrastructure choice, including model format, request processing, communication protocols, and containerization. 

3) Providing an analysis of the quality characteristics studied for each design decision option, showing a predominant focus on performance efficiency in the literature so far, with limited consideration of energy efficiency. 

4) Highlighting research gaps around comparing energy efficiency of different serving infrastructure options, and studying additional quality factors like scalability, ease-of-use, portability etc.

5) Laying the groundwork to guide future research and practitioner decisions on architecting green and efficient machine learning serving systems.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying and classifying the architectural design space for ML serving, including the current state of knowledge on associated quality trade-offs, with opportunities highlighted to improve sustainability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What was the rationale behind using a seed papers and snowballing strategy for the literature search rather than a more systematic approach like a systematic literature review? What are the tradeoffs with this approach?

2. Why were only 12 papers selected in the literature search? What criteria determined when to stop the snowballing process? Could relevant papers have been missed with such a limited set? 

3. The paper states "this study is a preliminary exploration, and the methodology outlined here may evolve in subsequent phases of research." What limitations exist in the current methodology that could be improved in future work? 

4. What process was used to extract and analyze the data from the selected papers? Were any qualitative analysis methods used or only quantitative summaries? Could researcher bias impact the analysis?

5. The selected papers seem to focus heavily on computer vision tasks. Do the findings generalize well to other areas like NLP? Should a more diverse set of papers have been included?

6. Could the identified architectural design decisions and quality aspects be structured into a more formal taxonomy or ontology? Would this add additional clarity?

7. The paper identifies a lack of research on energy efficiency and quality aspects beyond performance. Do the authors propose any hypotheses for why these areas are understudied? 

8. What specific guidelines or best practices can be derived from this preliminary study for architects and practitioners to build green ML serving systems? The current conclusions remain high-level.

9. The threat to validity sections mentions researcher bias. What specific steps were taken during data extraction and analysis to minimize bias from impacting the results?

10. The outlook suggests future work analyzing energy efficiency of the different serving infrastructure options. What specific experiments or comparisons would be most insightful to conduct? Which options seem most promising based on current knowledge?
