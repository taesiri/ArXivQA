# [UnMASKed: Quantifying Gender Biases in Masked Language Models through   Linguistically Informed Job Market Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) inherit biases present in their training data, reflecting human prejudices and societal norms. This includes gender biases which can propagate unfair stereotypes.  
- Prior work studying bias in LMs has limitations: focused only on English models, relies on external biased datasets, centered on U.S. cultural contexts.

Solution:  
- Proposes a linguistically-informed testing dataset to evaluate gender biases in masked LMs, targeting prediction of gendered pronouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives.
- Compares 6 major English LMs (BERT, RoBERTa etc.) and their multilingual variants (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa)
- Uses quantitative metrics like gender-associated token confidence (GTC) and qualitative analysis of predicted tokens.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates existence of gender biases in major MLMs, with tendency towards stereotypical associations.  
- Multilingual models display comparatively reduced biases, likely due to exposure to more diverse training data.
- Proposed methodology enables nuanced understanding of biases using linguistic frames of reference adaptable across domains and cultures. 
- Opens opportunities for linguistically-informed bias analysis in MLMs to inform development of more equitable NLP systems.

In summary, this paper conducts a rigorous multi-dimensional analysis to reveal and contrast gender biases in prominent English and multilingual MLMs. The findings highlight the need for refining training procedures of language models to mitigate representation biases and ensure fairer AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes gender biases in masked language models, finding stereotypical tendencies that are somewhat reduced in multilingual models due to greater linguistic diversity in training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes a novel methodology for evaluating gender biases in masked language models (MLMs) using a linguistically informed testing dataset. Specifically:

1) The dataset contains two subsets - one with job-related prompts for pronoun resolution and another targeting prediction of verbs, adverbs and adjectives based on masculine or feminine pronouns. This allows a nuanced analysis of biases.

2) The study evaluates six major MLMs - monolingual (English) and multilingual models - on this dataset using quantitative metrics like gender-associated token confidence and qualitative analysis of predicted tokens. 

3) The key findings are: (a) All models exhibit gender biases aligned with stereotypes, especially in pronoun resolution (b) Multilingual models demonstrate relatively reduced biases, likely due to exposure to more diverse linguistic data during training.

In summary, the linguistic testing dataset and comprehensive analysis of major MLMs offer new insights into gender biases while highlighting the potential of multilingual training for mitigating such biases. The proposed methodology can be adapted for bias evaluation in different contexts.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Masked language models (MLMs) 
- Gender bias
- Stereotypes
- Job market prompts
- Pronoun resolution
- Linguistic prompts
- Monolingual models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa)
- Multilingual models (BERT-multilingual, DistilBERT-multilingual, XLM-RoBERTa)  
- Gender-associated token confidence (GTC)
- Quantitative analysis 
- Qualitative analysis
- Parallel pairs
- Bias mitigation 
- Data selection techniques
- In-context retrieval augmented learning (IC-RAL)

The paper analyzes gender biases in masked language models using job market prompts and other linguistically informed prompts. It compares monolingual and multilingual variants of popular models like BERT and RoBERTa. The analysis relies on metrics like GTC and examination of predictions for pronouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. The key finding is that multilingual models demonstrate relatively reduced biases, likely due to exposure to more diverse training data. Overall, it underscores the need for developing equitable and unbiased language technologies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel dataset for evaluating gender biases in masked language models. What are the key components of this dataset and how is it structured? What advantages does this provide over existing bias evaluation datasets?

2. The paper evaluates bias using two main metrics - gender-associated token confidence (GTC) and monolingual-multilingual comparisons. Explain these metrics in detail. What specific calculations are performed and how do they enable quantitative bias comparisons? 

3. The linguistic token subset targets predictions for specific grammatical units like verbs, adverbs and adjectives. What is the motivation behind evaluating predictions across these different units? How does it provide deeper insights into bias manifestations?

4. The paper argues that the linguistic foundation of the tasks allows adaptation to different domains and contexts. Elaborate on this. What specific aspects of the methodology facilitate domain/context transferability? 

5. The analysis reveals interesting differences between monolingual and multilingual model variants. Discuss these key differences. How do the authors explain the apparent bias reduction in multilingual models?

6. The paper conducts fine-grained qualitative analysis using parallel token pairs. Explain this approach. How does it complement the quantitative analysis? What key insights emerge from comparing parallel pairs?

7. The paper argues that the bifurcation into job pronouns and linguistic tokens ensures holistic bias evaluation. Justify this statement by elaborating on how these two subsets together provide comprehensive assessment.  

8. The linguistic principles used for judgments (stereotypical vs non-stereotypical) are consistent across experiments. Discuss the framework used and how the evaluative criteria are applied.

9. The paper conducts in-depth comparative analysis between monolingual and corresponding multilingual models. Summarize the key trends observed in models like BERT vs BERT-multilingual and DistilBERT vs DistilBERT-multilingual.  

10. The paper demonstrates existence of biases but notes complexity of gender representations in language. Discuss ethical considerations and responsibilities of researchers in conducting and publishing such studies.
