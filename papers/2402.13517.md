# [Round Trip Translation Defence against Large Language Model Jailbreaking   Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13517)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to "social-engineered" attacks where carefully crafted adversarial prompts can induce the models to generate harmful or unexpected behaviors. These attacks exploit the models' lack of comprehension and intent detection abilities.  
- Existing defense methods like perplexity filters and input perturbation (e.g. SmoothLLM) have limited success in mitigating these attacks, with less than 50% mitigation rates.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a "Round Trip Translation" (RTT) method to defend against social-engineered attacks. 
- RTT involves translating the adversarial prompt into multiple non-Indo-European languages and then back to English. This paraphrases and generalizes the prompt to reveal any underlying harmful behavior.
- RTT takes advantage of the translation process relying on more generic terminology to convey meaning. This makes it easier for LLMs to detect harmful intent.

Key Results:
- RTT with 3 non-Indo-European languages (RTT3d) achieved over 70% attack mitigation on the state-of-the-art PAIR attack, doubling SmoothLLM's performance.
- RTT is the first defense against the MathAttack, achieving 40% mitigation.
- RTT demonstrated strong transferability across multiple LLMs while preserving over 80% performance on benign input.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposed a versatile and lightweight RTT defense applicable across LLMs without modifying model configurations.
- Achieved new state-of-the-art results in defending against social-engineered attacks (>70% mitigation). 
- First successful defense against MathAttack (40% mitigation).
- Showed RTT has high transferability and low impact on benign input.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using round trip translation through multiple languages as a defense against social-engineered adversarial attacks on large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new defense method called Round Trip Translation (RTT) to mitigate social-engineered attacks against large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- RTT is the first defense method specifically designed to defend against social-engineered attacks on LLMs. It works by paraphrasing and generalizing the adversarial prompts to make it easier for LLMs to detect the potentially harmful behavior. 

- RTT achieved over 70% attack mitigation on the state-of-the-art PAIR attacks. This is 20% higher mitigation rate than the previously best defense method (SmoothLLM).

- The authors are the first to attempt defending against MathAttack using RTT, and achieved almost 40% attack mitigation. 

- RTT is shown to be versatile, lightweight, and transferable to different LLMs without needing to modify the LLMs themselves.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing RTT as an effective new defense method against social-engineered attacks on LLMs, with strong empirical results demonstrating high attack mitigation rates and transferability across models.

The paper proposes a defensive technique called "Round Trip Translation" (RTT) to mitigate social-engineered attacks on large language models. It tests RTT against state-of-the-art attacks like PAIR and MathAttack, analyzes its ability to generalize input text, examines its transferability across models, and compares it to other paraphrasing methods. Key metrics are attack success rate and attack mitigation rate. The key terms and keywords reflect this focus and the main contributions of the work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Round Trip Translation (RTT) as a defense against adversarial attacks on large language models. Can you explain in more detail how the RTT method works and why translating text into multiple languages helps reveal harmful behavior? 

2. The authors tested RTT using both random languages as well as languages from different linguistic families. Can you elaborate on the differences in performance between these two approaches? Why might using languages from different families lead to better generalization?

3. When testing different numbers of translation languages for the RTT method, performance seemed to plateau after 3 languages. What might be some reasons that additional languages beyond 3 did not further improve attack mitigation?

4. How exactly does the RTT method help to "generalize" the terminology used in adversarial prompts? Can you provide some specific examples from the paper demonstrating this? 

5. The paper demonstrated strong performance of RTT on the PAIR attack. Can you discuss the nature of the PAIR attack and why existing defenses struggled to mitigate it effectively? How does RTT address the challenges posed by PAIR?

6. RTT achieved a 40% mitigation rate against the MathAttack, representing the first proposed defense against this attack. What makes the MathAttack difficult to defend against? And why might the text generalization of RTT help provide some protection?

7. The authors tested RTT on several language models besides Vicuna, including GPT-4 and Llama-2. Can you compare and contrast the performance of RTT when transferred to these other models? Why might transferability be important?

8. How exactly did the authors test the impact of RTT on performance for benign input queries? What dataset did they use and why was it appropriate for this analysis?

9. The paper mentions some limitations and future work related to RTT, including testing other translation algorithms. Can you elaborate on some of these limitations and how they might be addressed by future research? 

10. The authors propose possibly using an ensemble of multiple RTT prompts in the future, similar to the SmoothLLM defense. Can you explain how an ensemble approach might help improve performance and discuss any challenges associated with implementation?
