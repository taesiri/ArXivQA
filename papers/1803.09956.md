# [Learning Synergies between Pushing and Grasping with Self-supervised   Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09956)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to learn synergies between pushing and grasping from scratch through deep reinforcement learning. The key hypothesis is that it is possible to train complementary pushing and grasping policies end-to-end that can benefit from each other through experience/trial-and-error.The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework where pushing and grasping policies are jointly trained to maximize long-term rewards. The goal is to show that:1) The addition of learned pushing actions can enlarge the set of scenarios where grasping succeeds. 2) Pushing policies can be trained mainly through the expected improvement in future grasping rewards, without needing hand-defined objectives.3) Effective synergistic pushing and grasping policies can be learned on real systems through this framework.Overall, the paper aims to demonstrate a new perspective for bridging non-prehensile and prehensile manipulation through end-to-end deep reinforcement learning. The key hypothesis is that pushing and grasping policies can be jointly trained from scratch to capture complex synergistic behaviors.
