# [VLM-CPL: Consensus Pseudo Labels from Vision-Language Models for Human   Annotation-Free Pathological Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15836)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Pathological image classification plays a crucial role in disease diagnosis and treatment. Deep learning methods have achieved high accuracy but rely heavily on large labeled datasets which require extensive human annotation efforts. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have shown powerful zero-shot inference abilities but may have noisy predictions on downstream tasks due to domain shift.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes VLM-CPL, a novel human annotation-free method for pathological image classification. The key ideas are:

1) Obtain prompt-based pseudo labels from a VLM via zero-shot inference. Use multi-view consensus with input augmentation to filter unreliable ones. 

2) Obtain another set of feature-based pseudo labels via clustering images in the VLM's feature space. Identify consensus samples between the two sets of pseudo labels as reliable ones.

3) Propose high-confidence cross supervision to train the classifier from the reliable subset and the remaining unlabeled images, using two networks to supervise each other.

Main Contributions:

- First annotation-free pathological image classification method that does not require any human annotations
- A prompt-feature consensus strategy to effectively filter noisy pseudo labels obtained from VLMs
- A high-confidence cross supervision method that learns from both filtered reliable samples and remaining unlabeled ones

Experiments on two public datasets show the method improves accuracy over inference with state-of-the-art VLMs by 22.6 and 24.2 percentage points. It also outperforms existing noisy label learning methods. The approach significantly reduces the need for human annotation efforts in pathological image classification.
