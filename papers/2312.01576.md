# [Learning Efficient Unsupervised Satellite Image-based Building Damage   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01576)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new unsupervised building damage detection (U-BDD) task using only unlabeled pre- and post-disaster satellite image pairs. The authors first propose an advanced baseline leveraging vision-language foundation models like Grounding DINO, SAM, and CLIP for zero-shot inference to localize buildings and assess damage. To address domain gaps between satellite and generic images that reduce model confidence, they further develop the U-BDD++ framework which enhances the baseline through self-supervised fine-tuning. U-BDD++ includes a Building Proposal Generation module using multi-scale transformations and resolution enhancement so models can detect buildings of various sizes, and a CLIP-enabled Building Proposal Selection module that filters false positives with similar semantics to buildings. Experiments on a public benchmark dataset show U-BDD++ significantly improves building localization and damage classification over the baseline, with gains of 18.3% and 8.1% in F1 score respectively. The presented annotation-free paradigm enables more efficient real-world building damage assessment.
