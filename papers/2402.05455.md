# [Large Language Models for Psycholinguistic Plausibility Pretesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05455)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In psycholinguistics research, carefully controlling the plausibility of experimental materials is crucial to ensure findings reflect intended manipulations rather than external factors. This is typically done by having participants rate sentences, but this "pretesting" is time- and resource-consuming. 

- The paper investigates whether language models (LLMs) can provide plausibility judgments to substitute or supplement human ratings, to reduce the cost of pretesting.

Method:
- The authors examine the correlation between human and LLM plausibility ratings for sentences from 4 datasets representing diverse syntactic structures and plausibility levels. 

- They test a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-3, GPT-4, LLama and custom models. Both closed-source (GPT-3, GPT-4) and open-source models are examined.

- Two types of prompts are used: a general prompt with diverse syntactic examples, and specific prompts tailored to the structure of each dataset.

Results:
- GPT-4 shows high correlation (0.8-0.9) with human ratings across all datasets and structures. Other LLMs correlate well for common structures but not rarer ones. 

- Fine-tuning on other plausibility data does not improve performance. Prompts with relevant examples improve performance over no-example prompts.

- When used for filtering out implausible sentences, GPT-4 performs well. But performance drops for making fine-grained distinctions between similar sentences. 

Conclusions:
- LLMs can provide coarse-grained plausibility judgments to substitute or supplement human ratings, reducing pretesting costs. But human ratings are still needed when fine discrimination is required.

- GPT-4 consistently correlates strongly with humans and is a robust baseline. Many other models correlate well for common syntactic structures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates whether language models can provide plausibility judgments on sentences that correlate with human judgments, finding that GPT-4 judgments highly correlate across structures examined while other LMs correlate well only on common syntactic structures, with potential to reduce the cost of psycholinguistic pretesting but still lacking discriminative power for fine-grained judgments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper thoroughly investigates the correlation between human plausibility judgments and language model plausibility judgments across a wide range of models and syntactic structures. The key findings are:

1) Many large language models exhibit high correlation with human judgments on simple syntactic structures, while only GPT-4 shows consistently strong correlation even on more complex/rare structures. 

2) GPT-4 judgments can be effectively used to provide coarse-grained plausibility filtering (e.g. rejecting extremely implausible sentences), significantly reducing the cost and time needed for human pretesting. However, fine-grained judgments (e.g. precisely comparing two similar sentences) remain challenging even for GPT-4.

3) There is a methodology provided for translating language model scores into plausible human-like judgments, involving fitting a linear model on a small subset of human annotated data.

So in summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the feasibility of employing language models to replace or reduce human plausibility annotation efforts common in psycholinguistics research, while also delineating the limitations currently present in even the most advanced models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Psycholinguistics
- Language models (LMs) 
- Plausibility judgments
- Pretesting
- GPT-4
- Correlation
- Syntactic structures
- Recall-precision curves
- Variance
- Coarse-grained judgments
- Fine-grained judgments

The paper investigates using language models like GPT-4 to generate plausibility judgments on sentences that can be used to pretest materials for psycholinguistics experiments. It looks at the correlation between LM judgments and human judgments across different syntactic structures and sentence types. The performance is analyzed using metrics like recall-precision curves. Key findings are that GPT-4 correlates well across the board, while other LMs correlate on more common structures. Coarse-grained LM judgments are shown to be usable but fine-grained distinctions are still challenging. The variance in LM judgments is also much lower than human variance. So those seem to be the main key terms and concepts associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using language models to generate plausibility judgments instead of humans. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using human judgments? Consider factors like cost, scalability, accuracy, etc.

2. The paper tests a wide range of language models. What differences did you observe between the performance of closed-source versus open-source models in correlating with human judgments? What might explain these differences? 

3. The paper shows GPT-4 has the overall highest correlation with human judgments. However, for your own dataset with a global prompt, GPT-3.5 performed better. What characteristics of your dataset and prompt design might account for this exception?

4. The paper demonstrates the importance of providing good examples in the prompts to language models. What is the trade-off in providing more global, general examples versus more specific examples tailored to the syntactic structures in the test set?

5. The paper shows that language model judgments correlate well for filtering out implausible sentences but do not provide enough fine-grained discrimination for closely comparing sentence pairs. Propose some ways the method could be improved to better handle this fine-grained comparison.  

6. The variance of plausibility ratings from language models is much lower than for humans. How might this affect the applicability of language model plausibility ratings? Does the theoretical explanation provided make sense?

7. The paper hypothesizes that language model outputs represent an average over human responses. Given this view, how would you expect additional scale and data to impact the variance and accuracy of language model plausibility ratings? 

8. The paper demonstrates a method to map language model ratings to human ratings. What are the trade-offs of the two techniques explored (no human ratings versus a small set of human ratings)? When would each be preferable?

9. The finetuning experiment showed mixed impact depending on the dataset. Why might finetuning on some labeled data hurt correlation, while help it on other data? What does this suggest about the domains where language model tuning would be useful?

10. The paper focuses on evaluating language models for psycholinguistic pretesting. What other potential applications are there for automatic plausibility ratings from language models? How might the requirements or evaluation be different for those settings?
