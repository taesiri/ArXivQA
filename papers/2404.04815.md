# [Allo: A Programming Model for Composable Accelerator Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04815)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Specializing hardware accelerators for emerging applications like large language models can provide significant speedups and efficiency gains. However, manually designing such complex spatial architectures is challenging. High-level synthesis (HLS) tools require extensive code restructuring and pragma insertions to realize performance gains. Existing accelerator design languages (ADLs) focus more on single kernel optimization and struggle to compose multiple kernels into a high-performance design hierarchy. There is a lack of effective tools to bridge the productivity gap while retaining performance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Allo, a composable programming model for efficient spatial accelerator design. Allo allows programmers to progressively transform a vanilla algorithm into high performance hardware through a sequence of separate hardware customization primitives. These primitives encapsulate optimizations for compute, memory, data types and communication in a modular manner. Allo introduces reusable parameterized kernel templates to enhance productivity. A key distinction is Allo's composable schedules that can hierarchically integrate distinct kernels and connect them into a complete accelerator using streaming FIFO connections. Allo employs a hierarchical dataflow graph, propagation algorithms and holistic dataflow analysis to ensure correctness and maximize performance across kernel boundaries.

Main Contributions:
- Decoupled and verifiable hardware customization primitives 
- Construct complex designs through bottom-up composition of modular kernels 
- Memory layout type system and propagation algorithms for correctness
- Hierarchical dataflow graph representation and dataflow optimization
- Comprehensive evaluation on HLS benchmarks and large neural networks 
- On-board evaluation on spatial architecture for GPT-2 model showing 1.7x speedup and 5.4x better energy efficiency over NVIDIA A100 GPU

Overall, Allo aims to enhance programmer productivity without compromising performance for spatial accelerator design spanning single to multi-kernel complex hierarchies. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness over state-of-the-art HLS tools and ADLs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Allo introduces a composable programming model for hardware accelerator design that enables progressive customization of compute, memory, communication, and data types through verifiable program transformations, along with schedule composition to combine optimized kernels into large-scale spatial architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Allo, a composable programming model for efficient spatial accelerator design. Key aspects include:

1) Allo provides decoupled hardware customization primitives that allow progressive program transformations to customize compute, memory, data types and communication in a modular way. Each transformation step is verifiable for correctness.

2) Allo introduces reusable parameterized kernel templates to facilitate constructing optimized hardware libraries. 

3) Allo enables composable schedules where smaller customized kernels can be composed in a bottom-up manner to build larger accelerator designs. This includes a type system to ensure correctness during composition and holistic dataflow optimizations across kernels.

4) Comprehensive evaluations on benchmarks and large neural network models demonstrate Allo's capabilities in generating high performance spatial architectures. This includes a 5.4x more energy efficient FPGA accelerator for the GPT-2 model compared to an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

In summary, Allo aims to strike a balance between manual control and automated optimizations while enhancing productivity for spatial accelerator design. The composable programming model is the key distinction compared to prior high-level synthesis tools and accelerator design languages.
