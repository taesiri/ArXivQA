# [Continuous-Time Radar-Inertial and Lidar-Inertial Odometry using a   Gaussian Process Motion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper tackles the problem of continuous-time trajectory estimation and mapping using motion-distorted sensors such as lidar and radar in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs). Specifically, it addresses three key challenges:

1) The high rate and asynchronous nature of lidar, radar and IMU measurements makes it difficult to integrate them properly for state estimation. 

2) Lidar and radar sensors suffer from motion distortion effects due to the scanning motion while the platform is moving, corrupting the measurements.

3) Radar measurements are much sparser and noisier compared to lidar, posing additional challenges.

Proposed Solution:
The key ideas proposed in this paper are:

1) Employ a Gaussian process motion prior to enable efficient continuous-time trajectory estimation. This allows handling the high rate and asynchronous sensor measurements.

2) Treat the gyroscope as a direct measurement of angular velocity while preintegrating the accelerometer to get velocity factors. This enables tightly coupled integration of IMU measurements.

3) Use the posterior trajectory distribution to undistort the lidar and radar scans before finding correspondences and generating measurement factors. This compensates for motion distortion.  

4) For radar, use a Doppler distortion compensation factor during scan matching to account for range distortion. Also employ aggressive map maintenance to prune transient noisy detections.

5) Demonstrate real-time performance through efficient implementation and approximation techniques.

The proposed approach termed STEAM (Smoothed Tightly-coupled Elastic-motion Adjustment and Mapping) is implemented as a sliding window optimizer using the Gauss-Newton algorithm.

Main Contributions:

1) First demonstration of real-time, continuous-time lidar-inertial and radar-inertial odometry using a Gaussian process motion prior.

2) 19% performance improvement for radar odometry through tight integration with IMU compared to radar-only odometry.

3) Real-time radar-inertial odometry using a spinning mechanical radar, fusing both gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. 

4) Detailed experimental analysis highlighting differences in lidar and radar odometry performance under various conditions.

5) Publicly released open source implementation of the proposed approaches.
