# [Data-freeWeight Compress and Denoise for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling up language models faces constraints due to GPU memory limitations and computational speed. Techniques like pruning and quantization have been used to address this, but they require fine-tuning on additional datasets which can introduce distributional bias. 

- Existing matrix decomposition methods for compression either operate on matrices independently or lack analysis of the interactions between components in language model architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes a novel data-free compression method called Joint Rank-k Approximation. It decomposes matrices jointly within operators like the attention and feedforward modules to better preserve the original mapping space while compressing.

- Theoretical analysis is provided on how Joint Rank-k Approximation can help denoise weight matrices by removing low-intensity components, potentially even improving model performance and robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces Joint Rank-k Approximation for efficient, data-free compression of language models. Achieves 80% pruning while retaining 93.43% performance.

- Provides analysis and experiments on Joint Rank-k Approximation's effectiveness for removing noise from weight matrices and improving model generalization. 

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Joint Rank-k Approximation outperforms other compression techniques. Ablation studies validate design choices and the method's versatility across models.

In summary, the paper presents a novel data-free compression technique for language models that leverages intrinsic model structure. Both theoretical and empirical analysis are used to demonstrate its effectiveness and properties.
