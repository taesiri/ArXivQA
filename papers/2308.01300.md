# [Revisiting DETR Pre-training for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01300)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether existing self-supervised pre-training methods, especially DETReg, can effectively improve the performance of strong DETR-based object detectors. 

The paper re-evaluates the effectiveness of DETReg when applied to increasingly powerful DETR architectures like Deformable DETR and H-Deformable DETR. It finds that DETReg provides only minor improvements or sometimes even hurts performance on these strong baseline models. 

To address this issue, the paper investigates crucial design aspects of the pre-training scheme, including the choice of localization and classification pre-training targets. It proposes a simple self-training approach with better pseudo box and class targets that significantly improves various DETR models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that existing self-supervised pre-training approaches have limitations when applied to strong DETR models, and simple modifications to the pre-training targets can unlock greater performance gains. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed simple self-training scheme addresses the limitations and effectively boosts state-of-the-art DETR detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Re-evaluating the effectiveness of the representative DETR pre-training approach DETReg on strong DETR architectures like Deformable DETR and H-Deformable DETR. The authors find that DETReg shows diminishing improvements on these architectures compared to vanilla DETR. 

2. Analyzing the issues with DETReg's localization and classification pre-training targets. The unreliable boxes from selective search and weak semantic signal from feature reconstruction limit its effectiveness on robust models.

3. Proposing a simple self-training scheme with better pseudo box and class predictions as pre-training targets. This significantly improves strong DETR models, unlike DETReg.

4. Demonstrating the utility of Objects365 and synthetic datasets generated using text-to-image models as alternatives to ImageNet for pre-training. These complex scene datasets boost performance.

5. Achieving new state-of-the-art detection results, e.g. 59.3% AP on COCO using H-Deformable DETR and the proposed improvements.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous re-evaluation of DETR pre-training, identifying issues with prior approaches, and proposing enhancements through better pre-training targets and datasets. The simple self-training scheme consistently improves strong DETR models.

- Overall, this paper provides new insights and techniques to improve DETR pre-training. It demonstrates limitations of prior methods when applied to state-of-the-art DETR models. The critical analysis and simple yet effective solutions could positively influence future research in this area.

In summary, the key novelties are the critical reassessment of existing methods, the investigation of pre-training targets, the proposed simple self-training scheme, and use of synthetic data for pre-training. The paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in DETR pre-training.

- Continue exploring the use of synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image models for pre-training. The authors found promising results using early text-to-image models and believe expanding the synthetic pre-training datasets could lead to further improvements.

- Re-assess existing self-supervised pre-training methods when applied to stronger DETR models. The authors hope their work will motivate more rigorous evaluation of pre-training techniques as DETR methods continue to advance.

- Develop more effective pre-training solutions for DETR that can better leverage the transformer architecture. The authors believe there is room for improvement over the pre-training approaches analyzed in the paper.

- Study how insights from pre-training DETR could transfer to other transformer-based vision models beyond object detection. The lessons on pre-training transformers for detection may generalize more broadly.

- Expand the analysis to include additional model architectures, training regimes, and datasets. The authors focused on specific setups and suggest broadening the investigation.

In summary, the main future directions are developing better pre-training techniques for advanced DETR models, expanding pre-training to more vision tasks, utilizing synthetic data, and transferring insights to other transformer vision models. The authors aim to stimulate further research to truly advance DETR pre-training.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper re-examines the effectiveness of DETReg, a representative self-supervised pre-training approach for DETR object detectors, when applied to increasingly stronger DETR architectures. The authors find that DETReg provides little to no gains on top of state-of-the-art DETR models like Deformable DETR. They analyze the reasons behind this limitation, identifying unreliable box proposals from unsupervised methods and lack of semantic information as key issues. To address this, they propose a simple self-training scheme using predictions from a COCO detector as pseudo-boxes and pseudo-classes for pre-training, which significantly improves results. They also explore pre-training with synthetic datasets generated by recent image-to-text and text-to-image models, finding comparable improvements to real image datasets. Overall, this work provides a more rigorous assessment of DETR pre-training methods, proposes impactful enhancements through self-training targets, and demonstrates the potential of synthetic datasets for scaling pre-training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper re-evaluates the effectiveness of DETReg, a representative self-supervised pre-training approach for DETR-based object detectors. The authors find that DETReg fails to provide significant improvements when applied to stronger DETR architectures like Deformable DETR and H-Deformable DETR. To address this, they propose a simple self-training scheme that generates pseudo-labels using a trained COCO detector and uses these for pre-training localization and classification targets. Their approach of using pseudo-box predictions and pseudo-class labels as pre-training targets consistently outperforms DETReg across different DETR models. The simple self-training method brings large gains over random initialization and DETReg, even boosting state-of-the-art H-Deformable DETR from 49.6% to 52.8% AP on COCO. Additionally, the authors show that using a more complex scene dataset like Objects365 is better than ImageNet for this pre-training scheme.

The authors also explore using synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image models like ControlNet and SDXL for pre-training. Remarkably, pre-training on 2.3M synthetic images leads to similar improvements as Objects365 over random initialization, indicating the potential of leveraging synthetically expanded datasets. Overall, this work provides a more rigorous assessment of DETR pre-training schemes, proposes impactful enhancements like simple self-training, and explores promising directions with synthetic data. It challenges previous conclusions about efficacy of methods like DETReg, and pushes forward stronger solutions to enable more effective DETR pre-training.
