# [Revisiting DETR Pre-training for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01300)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether existing self-supervised pre-training methods, especially DETReg, can effectively improve the performance of strong DETR-based object detectors. 

The paper re-evaluates the effectiveness of DETReg when applied to increasingly powerful DETR architectures like Deformable DETR and H-Deformable DETR. It finds that DETReg provides only minor improvements or sometimes even hurts performance on these strong baseline models. 

To address this issue, the paper investigates crucial design aspects of the pre-training scheme, including the choice of localization and classification pre-training targets. It proposes a simple self-training approach with better pseudo box and class targets that significantly improves various DETR models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that existing self-supervised pre-training approaches have limitations when applied to strong DETR models, and simple modifications to the pre-training targets can unlock greater performance gains. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed simple self-training scheme addresses the limitations and effectively boosts state-of-the-art DETR detectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Re-evaluating the effectiveness of the representative DETR pre-training approach DETReg on strong DETR architectures like Deformable DETR and H-Deformable DETR. The authors find that DETReg shows diminishing improvements on these architectures compared to vanilla DETR. 

2. Analyzing the issues with DETReg's localization and classification pre-training targets. The unreliable boxes from selective search and weak semantic signal from feature reconstruction limit its effectiveness on robust models.

3. Proposing a simple self-training scheme with better pseudo box and class predictions as pre-training targets. This significantly improves strong DETR models, unlike DETReg.

4. Demonstrating the utility of Objects365 and synthetic datasets generated using text-to-image models as alternatives to ImageNet for pre-training. These complex scene datasets boost performance.

5. Achieving new state-of-the-art detection results, e.g. 59.3% AP on COCO using H-Deformable DETR and the proposed improvements.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous re-evaluation of DETR pre-training, identifying issues with prior approaches, and proposing enhancements through better pre-training targets and datasets. The simple self-training scheme consistently improves strong DETR models.

1. What is the motivation behind this work? What are the key improvements over prior arts?

This work aims to revisit the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training approaches for DETR-based object detectors. Prior arts like UP-DETR and DETReg claimed significant gains by pre-training the Transformer in DETR in a self-supervised manner. However, our experiments show that their improvements are very minor or even none when applied to recent strong DETR models. We propose a simple self-training scheme that leads to more substantial gains. The key improvement is that we leverage pseudo labels from a trained detector as targets which injects semantic information into pre-training and avoids the noisy and weak supervision of tasks like random patch masking or reconstruction.

2. What is the core idea behind the proposed method? How does it work?

The core idea is to use confident predictions from a trained detection model to guide the pre-training process. Specifically, we first train an off-the-shelf object detector like Deformable DETR on the downstream dataset like COCO. Then we apply the detector to the pre-training dataset like ImageNet or Objects365 to generate pseudo box targets and pseudo class targets. These targets are then used to pre-train the Transformer encoder-decoder of a DETR model by optimizing box regression and classification losses. This injects more semantic information and localization knowledge compared to random patch or region based pretext tasks.

3. How do you generate the pseudo box and class targets? What measures are taken to ensure their quality?

We take the top confident predictions from the detector, such as top 30 boxes per image. For classes, we directly take the predicted COCO classes from the detector. To ensure pseudo box quality, we train the detector until convergence and only keep predictions with confidence score larger than 0.5. We also experiment with different numbers of pseudo boxes and find keeping top 30 yields the best performance. For classes, since COCO has 80 classes which is a subset of ImageNet, directly using predicted COCO classes works reasonably well.

4. Why is this simple self-training scheme effective for DETR pre-training? What are the advantages over previous methods?

This scheme directly optimizes the DETR network with localization and classification targets predicted by a powerful teacher model. It provides accurate semantic pseudo labels that facilitate representation learning. In contrast, previous pretext tasks like random patch detection and reconstruction have no semantic meaning and lead to weak supervision. Our method also avoids complex pretraining pipelines like computing image embeddings as targets. The simplicity and direct optimization makes this scheme effective.

5. How do you explain the performance drop when using more pseudo boxes like 100 per image? Does it suggest any limitations?

When using more pseudo boxes like 100 per image, we observe a minor performance drop compared to 30 boxes. A couple potential reasons: 1) As shown in the AR metrics, the proposal quality drops when taking more boxes, indicating more noise. 2) During pre-training, the model may overfit to noisy signals if the target is too large. This highlights the importance of keeping high-quality targets e.g. through confidence filtering. It suggests the limitations of our method is that the targets cannot be too noisy or the model may not effectively learn semantics.

6. What are the differences between this work and conventional self-training methods? Why not iterate pseudo label generation?

Unlike conventional self-training, we don't iteratively update pseudo labels using model predictions like NoisyStudent. Our teacher model is fixed without any self-training cycles. This avoids error accumulation and complex scheduling. We show even one-time pseudo label generation is effective for pre-training by providing direct optimization signals. The simplicity makes our method easy to adopt.

7. How do the results compare on different DETR models like vanilla DETR vs Deformable DETR? What does this suggest?

We experimented on vanilla DETR, Deformable DETR and latest $\mathcal{H}$-Deformable DETR. The gains are much more significant on earlier DETR models. For $\mathcal{H}$-Deformable DETR, the gains diminish but still sizable. This suggests that as the model complexity increases, the benefits of pre-training decrease somewhat, but still help boost performance. It points to the importance of revisiting prior arts like UP-DETR with modern DETR designs. 

8. You mentioned employing stronger backbones during pre-training. What improvements would that bring? What are the potential challenges?

Using stronger backbones like Swin Transformers would allow extracting higher quality pseudo labels, providing richer supervision for pre-training. This could further boost DETR performance on downstream tasks. The main challenge is the computational cost. Swin backbones are much larger, slowing down pre-training and fine-tuning. Efficient knowledge distillation may help to obtain a smaller student model retaining the improved representations.

9. How well would this method transfer to other end-to-end detectors like Sparse R-CNN? Could the idea generalize?

I believe a similar self-training approach could also benefit other end-to-end detectors like Sparse R-CNN. The overall idea of leveraging a trained teacher model to provide localization and classification targets aligns well with those one-stage detectors too. The key would be generating high-quality pseudo boxes and classes as the training signal. One could experiment with different teacher models and filtering mechanisms to implement an effective self-training pipeline.

10. Could synthetic data from image generation models provide improvements? How would you leverage synthetic images?

Yes, synthetic images from generative models could offer another means for improvement. One approach is to directly use them for pre-training by predicting pseudo boxes and classes on generated images. This enlarges the pool of pre-training data. Another option is generating images conditioned on ground truth boxes, then training with real box labels. This can give semantically meaningful images with accurate boxes. Combining synthetic images with real data during pre-training could make the representations more robust and balanced. The key is utilizing synthetic images to complement real data.
