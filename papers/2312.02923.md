# [Split &amp; Merge: Unlocking the Potential of Visual Adapters via Sparse   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02923)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Mixture of Sparse Adapters (MoSA), a novel Adapter Tuning method that enhances the performance of standard adapters for visual tasks without introducing additional parameters or computation. MoSA first splits the standard adapter into multiple non-overlapping sparse adapter modules. During training, it stochastically activates different sparse adapter modules to increase model capacity. Consistency regularization is applied to align the outputs of different modules. After training, the sparse modules are merged into a complete dense adapter for efficient inference. Through this split-merge approach combined with sparse mixed training, MoSA fully unleashes the potential of standard adapters, eliminating redundant parameters. Comprehensive experiments on 27 visual tasks demonstrate that MoSA consistently outperforms all baselines, including full fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results for Adapter Tuning methods. Notably, MoSA excels in challenging low-resource and multi-task scenarios. The integration of sparsity and mixture-of-experts in MoSA maximizes parameter efficiency while ensuring performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Mixture of Sparse Adapters (MoSA), a novel Adapter Tuning method that enhances performance by splitting the standard adapter into multiple sparse experts, stochastically activating them during training, and merging them back into a complete adapter for efficient inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Adapter Tuning method called Mixture of Sparse Adapters (MoSA) to improve the performance of standard adapters for visual tasks without introducing extra parameters or computation. Specifically:

- They propose to split the standard adapter into multiple non-overlapping sparse adapters, and stochastically activate them during training for mixed experts training. This helps unleash the potential of each parameter in the adapter. 

- They propose a hierarchical sparse strategy to preserve the down-projection layer dense while only sparsely splitting the up-projection layer. This facilitates the combination of sparse training and mixture-of-experts.

- After training, they merge the sparse adapters into a complete dense adapter for efficient inference, achieving efficiency in storage and computation.

Through comprehensive experiments, they demonstrate MoSA consistently outperforms other Adapter Tuning methods and baselines on 27 visual tasks, while maintaining high efficiency. The key contribution is maximizing parameter efficiency and performance for Adapter Tuning through the organic integration of sparsity and mixture-of-experts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- Mixture of Sparse Adapters (MoSA): The name of the proposed method for enhancing the performance of standard adapters in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Involves splitting, stochastic activation, and merging of adapters.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT): Tuning only a small subset of parameters from a pre-trained model for each downstream task, for efficiency in storage and utilization of available data. 

- Adapter Tuning: A popular PEFT method that introduces lightweight bottleneck modules into a pre-trained model while freezing the backbone.

- Sparse training: Updating only a subset of the parameters during training to act as a regularization. Used in conjunction with adapter tuning.

- Mixture-of-experts (MoE): Using a mixture of separate modules/networks to enhance model capacity and performance. Integrated with sparse training in MoSA.  

- Stochastic activation: Random activation of different experts/modules during training to increase diversity and capacity.

- Merging experts: Combining the parameters of separately trained experts/modules before inference to maximize efficiency.

The key focus of the paper is improving adapter tuning performance for vision tasks through an integrated sparse training and MoE approach, while maintaining efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How exactly does MoSA split the standard adapter into multiple sparse adapters? What is the rationale behind using a random splitting method based on quantiles of a uniform distribution?

2. What is the motivation behind using a stochastic activation mechanism during training rather than a routing mechanism as in traditional mixture-of-experts methods? How does this save computational costs?

3. Why does a hierarchical sparse strategy, with a dense down-projection layer and multiple sparse up-projection layers, improve performance over applying sparsity to both layers? How does this mitigate issues with limited training data? 

4. How exactly does the deep feature alignment strategy ensure compatibility between parameters when merging the sparse adapters after training? Why align only the deeper features rather than all features?

5. During inference, what is the benefit of merging sparse adapters into a complete one rather than using stochastic activation or ensemble strategies? How does the merging not negatively impact performance?

6. How does MoSA maximize the balance between efficiency and performance in all stages (sparsification, mixed training, inference)? What is the key benefit over standalone sparse training methods?

7. Why does the number of expert splits impact performance? What causes declines in accuracy with too few or too many splits? What is the optimal range?

8. How does varying the adapter bottleneck dimension impact AdaptFormer versus MoSA? Why does MoSA continue to improve while AdaptFormer declines beyond a point?  

9. Why does MoSA consistently outperform across different backbone model scales and architectures? What allows it to adapt better than other methods?

10. Could the concept behind MoSA, to enhance parameter utilization, be applied to other addition-based parameter-efficient fine tuning methods? What would need to be adapted?
