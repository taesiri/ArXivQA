# [Task and Motion Planning in Hierarchical 3D Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Task and Motion Planning in Hierarchical 3D Scene Graphs":

Problem:
- Task and motion planning (TAMP) aims to find feasible plans that achieve high-level goals by reasoning over both symbolic task planning and continuous motion planning. 
- TAMP problems can become intractable to solve as the complexity and scale of the environment increases. 
- Recent work has developed detailed 3D scene graphs as environmental representations, but how to efficiently formulate TAMP problems using these large-scale graphs is an open question.

Proposed Solution:
- Identify properties of TAMP domains that allow for pruning of redundant symbols while preserving plan validity and expressivity.
- Propose a method to construct a simplified TAMP domain from a Hydra scene graph that meets these properties. Places that don't appear in start/goal can be safely ignored.
- Implement a hierarchical planner with abstract task planning over pruned domain, place-based navigation planning, and motion planning.
- Incrementally add objects to domain during search when needed to explain failed plans.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized sufficient conditions for removing symbols from TAMP problems without losing completeness
- Method for translating Hydra scene graphs into sparse TAMP domains that meet these conditions  
- Hierarchical planner architecture aligned with scene graph structure that factors problem into task, navigation, and motion planning
- Algorithm for lazily adding objects to planning domain based on geometric failures during search
- Evaluations across environments showing benefits of approach for scaling, goal complexity, and obstructed scenes

The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions toward efficiently solving complex task and motion planning problems in large-scale 3D environments represented as scene graphs. The hierarchical planning architecture and incremental domain construction methods are key to increasing scalability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for defining and solving large-scale task and motion planning problems in 3D environments represented as hierarchical scene graphs by identifying redundant elements in the scene graph to simplify the planning domain while still ensuring feasible plans can be found.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Defining a set of properties that a TAMP domain must possess to ensure that any plans returned actually meet the user's specifications. 

2. Formulating a sufficient condition for removing symbols from a planning problem while maintaining feasibility. This shows that many places in a scene graph can be ignored when formulating certain kinds of planning problems, greatly reducing planning times. 

3. A method to further accelerate planning by incrementally identifying objects in the scene as relevant during search according to how they affect the feasibility of certain abstract plans. Since finding a small set of relevant objects is difficult, they incrementally add objects that cause plan failures to make the problem feasible.

In summary, the main contribution is an approach to enable and accelerate task and motion planning in large-scale environments represented as 3D scene graphs. This is done by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the scene graph to simplify the planning domain, while still ensuring completeness and plan feasibility.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Task and motion planning (TAMP)
- 3D scene graphs
- Hybrid metric-semantic representations
- Hydra scene graphs
- Planning domains
- PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)
- Execution-consistency 
- Redundant symbols
- Weakly redundant symbols
- Motion planning through places
- Hierarchical planners
- Incremental object solving

The paper presents a novel approach for defining and solving task and motion planning problems using large-scale, hierarchical 3D scene graphs. It identifies methods for building sparse planning domains, pruning redundant symbols from the domain while preserving plan validity, and incrementally adding relevant objects during search to avoid wasting computation on irrelevant parts of the scene graph. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on hand crafted domains and scene graphs built from real perception data.

So in summary, the key focus is on scalable and efficient task and motion planning by taking advantage of the structure and semantics represented within hierarchical scene graphs. The methods leverage planning domains, symbolic reasoning, motion planning, and incremental search techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel approach for defining and solving Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problems in large-scale environments using hierarchical 3D scene graphs. Can you elaborate on why solving TAMP problems directly on large 3D scene graphs is computationally intractable? What are the key factors that contribute to this intractability?

2. One of the key ideas proposed in the paper is the concept of a "verifier function" that can map motion subsequences to sets of PDDL facts. Can you explain this idea in more detail? How does the concept of execution-consistency relate to this?

3. The paper identifies redundant and weakly redundant symbols in the 3D scene graph and proposes methods to prune them to simplify the planning problem instance. Can you analyze the differences between these two types of redundant symbols and the conditions under which they can be safely pruned?  

4. Place pruning is done by modifying the move action to allow longer distance motion planning. Can you explain how this idea works and why it enables easy identification of redundant places? What is the tradeoff involved in choosing granularity of each move action?

5. The paper proposes a 3-level hierarchical planning architecture aligned with the scene graph hierarchy. Can you explain the different components and how dividing the planning problem this way helps in efficiently solving large-scale TAMP problems?

6. The motion planning algorithm leverages connectivity information in the full scene graph even when parts of it are pruned from the PDDL domain. Can you analyze why this is an important idea and how it helps in planning long feasible trajectories?

7. Instead of pre-identifying all weakly redundant objects, the paper proposes an incremental algorithm to lazily add objects during planning. What is the key idea behind this approach? When is it applicable?

8. How does the paper evaluate the proposed approach? What were the different goal complexity metrics and environment types used? Can you summarize the key results?

9. The paper demonstrates the method on a specific Inspection domain problem. How can the ideas proposed be generalized to other TAMP domains leveraging scene graphs? What are the limitations?

10. The paper proposes future work directions like learning to identify redundant symbols. In your opinion, what are other promising ways to build on this work to solve even larger scale TAMP problems efficiently?
