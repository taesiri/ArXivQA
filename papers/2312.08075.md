# [TERM Model: Tensor Ring Mixture Model for Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08075)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for probability density estimation called the Tensor Ring Mixture Model (TERM). It leverages the tensor ring (TR) decomposition to represent the coefficient tensor for expanding the density function in a B-spline basis. TR offers balanced ranks and more expressive power compared to prior tensor train approaches. The authors further introduce a mixture model on top of the basic TR density estimator (TRDE) that combines multiple TR structures with different feature permutations and learns adaptive weights for them. This ensemble approach draws inspiration from classical Gaussian mixture models, acknowledging that multiple views of the data can enhance flexibility. Experiments on 2D and 3D toy datasets demonstrate TRDE's ability to effectively model complex distributions and generate high quality samples. Evaluations on real-world tabular datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art normalizing flows and autoregressive models. The benefits include exact sampling, calculating cumulative/marginal densities and derivatives, linear storage, and computational efficiency. The limitations are overfitting on small datasets and instability with larger ranks. Overall, the TR mixture model provides a promising new tensor-based approach to density estimation and generative modeling.
