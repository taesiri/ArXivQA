# [Caregiver Talk Shapes Toddler Vision: A Computational Study of Dyadic   Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04118)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a computational model to study how caregivers' naming utterances during dyadic play sessions can help toddlers learn better visual representations of objects. The authors introduce a novel dataset called the Dyadic Play Dataset (DPD) which simulates images seen from a toddler's egocentric viewpoint during play sessions with toys, along with co-occurring caregiver utterances. They model the toddler's learning using two self-supervised losses - one that aligns representations of temporally close images, and another that aligns representations of images and their paired utterances. Experiments demonstrate that using utterances with statistics matching developmental studies leads to improved category recognition compared to not using utterances. Analysis reveals the quality of learned representations is quite sensitive to small changes in utterance statistics around developmentally-plausible values. This is attributed to the model's increased textual attention on object names with more frequent and less ambiguous utterances. Overall, the work provides computational support for the hypothesis that even sparse and ambiguous caregiver utterances can help guide toddlers' visual representation learning.
