# [MAIR: Multi-view Attention Inverse Rendering with 3D Spatially-Varying   Lighting Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12368)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we perform robust scene-level inverse rendering using multi-view images to estimate geometry, materials, and lighting in real indoor scenes?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Leveraging multi-view stereo depth and multiple observations of the same scene point can help estimate geometry, materials, and lighting more robustly compared to single image inverse rendering methods. 

2) A staged training pipeline that first estimates direct lighting and geometry, then materials, and finally full spatially-varying lighting can increase efficiency and reduce memory consumption for multi-view inverse rendering.

3) Representing direct lighting with both spherical Gaussians and voxels provides complementary cues about incident radiance and 3D exitant radiance to help estimate SVBRDF and spatially-varying lighting.

4) An attention-based multi-view aggregation network can selectively combine information across views to estimate materials more accurately.

In summary, the paper proposes a multi-view inverse rendering framework called MAIR to address the limitations of single image methods and enable more robust estimation of scene properties for real-world indoor images. The key innovation seems to be exploiting multi-view stereo depth and a staged training approach to efficiently handle multiple views.
