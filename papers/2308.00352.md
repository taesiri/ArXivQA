# MetaGPT: Meta Programming for Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is developing an innovative framework called MetaGPT that can effectively coordinate multiple LLM agents to collaborate and solve complex real-world problems. The main hypothesis is that by integrating insights from human team workflows and standard operating procedures (SOPs) into the architecture and prompting of LLM agents, the authors can mitigate issues like incoherence, unproductive loops, and aimless dialogue that often arise in conversational multi-agent systems. Specifically, the paper proposes encoding SOPs into prompts to provide structured coordination, assigning modular subtasks to agents based on roles and expertise, and introducing standardized outputs to validate results and minimize cascading errors. Through this meta programming approach, the authors hypothesize they can create LLM-based multi-agent systems that exhibit enhanced effectiveness, robustness, and applicability for complex collaborative tasks compared to existing frameworks.The central research questions explored are:- Can incorporating real-world teamwork practices and workflows into multi-agent system design lead to more coherent, efficient, and goal-oriented collaboration between agents?- Does structuring prompts and outputs based on domain knowledge and industry conventions improve the quality and validity of LLM agent results? - Can meta programming techniques coordinate specialized LLM agents to collectively solve intricate real-world problems that are intractable for individual agents?By developing the MetaGPT framework and evaluating it on collaborative software engineering tasks, the paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of integrating procedural knowledge and human expertise into LLM-based multi-agent systems through meta programming.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes MetaGPT, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates human domain knowledge and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to enable more coherent and structured collaboration between large language model (LLM) agents. 2. It designs the framework architecture with two key layers - the foundational components layer and the collaboration layer. The foundational layer provides building blocks like roles, actions, tools etc. while the collaboration layer implements mechanisms like knowledge sharing and workflow encapsulation using SOPs.3. It showcases software development as an application of the framework, defining specialized roles like ProductManager, Architect, ProjectManager etc. aligned with real-world team practices. Detailed prompts are crafted to instantiate SOPs and enable roles to produce standardized outputs. 4. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, highlighting the benefits of incorporating domain expertise and structured coordination. Experiments indicate a 100% task completion rate.5. Ablation studies validate the importance of role modularity and task decomposition in handling complexity. Comparisons with other frameworks like AutoGPT, LangChain and AgentVerse indicate MetaGPT's more holistic and robust performance.6. The paper presents a novel perspective on integrating meta programming with agent collaboration and structured processes like SOPs. This convergence transforms the landscape of complex problem solving using LLMs.In summary, the key innovation is using meta programming to implement SOPs and domain knowledge within a multi-agent LLM architecture. By emulating real-world team expertise, MetaGPT demonstrates enhanced coherence, validation and structured outputs, tackling limitations in existing systems. The proposed techniques enable more human-aligned collaborative problem solving.
