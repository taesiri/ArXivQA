# [Empower Large Language Model to Perform Better on Industrial   Domain-Specific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11541)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question or hypothesis is:How can we augment large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge to improve their performance on domain-specific question answering tasks? The authors propose that existing methods to enhance LLMs using retrieval or external modules have limitations. Their hypothesis is that a new model interaction paradigm where a small LLM provides generated domain knowledge to a larger LLM can be more effective. To test this, they construct a new cloud domain QA dataset (MSQA) since there is limited availability of domain-specific QA benchmarks. Using this dataset, they show their proposed model interaction approach outperforms retrieval methods in providing accurate, domain-knowledge-enriched answers.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively equip LLMs with relevant domain knowledge. The authors hypothesize and demonstrate that having a small LLM provide generated domain knowledge can achieve this better than current methods. Evaluating this on the new domain QA dataset MSQA is central to testing their approach.
