# [Empower Large Language Model to Perform Better on Industrial   Domain-Specific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11541)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question or hypothesis is:

How can we augment large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge to improve their performance on domain-specific question answering tasks? 

The authors propose that existing methods to enhance LLMs using retrieval or external modules have limitations. Their hypothesis is that a new model interaction paradigm where a small LLM provides generated domain knowledge to a larger LLM can be more effective. 

To test this, they construct a new cloud domain QA dataset (MSQA) since there is limited availability of domain-specific QA benchmarks. Using this dataset, they show their proposed model interaction approach outperforms retrieval methods in providing accurate, domain-knowledge-enriched answers.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively equip LLMs with relevant domain knowledge. The authors hypothesize and demonstrate that having a small LLM provide generated domain knowledge can achieve this better than current methods. Evaluating this on the new domain QA dataset MSQA is central to testing their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The construction of a new cloud domain QA dataset called MSQA, which contains over 23k question-answering pairs from the Microsoft Q&A forum. This seems to be the first dataset focused specifically on the cloud domain.

2. A proposed model interaction paradigm that involves fine-tuning a small language model on domain documentation to align it with domain knowledge, and using this model at runtime to provide domain-specific knowledge to larger LLMs to improve their performance on domain tasks. 

3. Evaluation of the proposed model interaction approach on the new MSQA dataset, showing it can outperform commonly used retrieval-based methods for incorporating domain knowledge.

4. Introduction of new metrics tailored for evaluating long-length answers in domain-specific QA.

So in summary, the key contributions seem to be the new cloud QA dataset, the proposed model interaction paradigm to infuse LLMs with domain knowledge, evaluation of this approach on the dataset, and new domain QA evaluation metrics. The model interaction approach appears to be the core novel method proposed and evaluated in the paper.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models for industry-specific question answering:

- The creation of the MSQA dataset is a novel contribution. To my knowledge, this is the first publicly available question answering dataset focused specifically on the cloud/IT domain. Previously, most QA datasets were more general or focused on domains like medicine, law, etc. Having a domain-specific dataset enables more targeted research.

- The model interaction paradigm proposed in the paper is also a new approach aimed at improving LLMs for industry domains. As discussed in the related work section, prior methods relied more on retrieval or external modules. Interacting a small and large model is an interesting alternative way to provide the LLM with domain knowledge.

- The paper explores a problem setting - long form, free text responses for industry QA - that has received less attention compared to things like extractive QA over paragraphs. Evaluating the quality of long responses is more challenging. The proposed evaluation metrics are helpful additions.

- Overall, the empirical results demonstrate the challenges standard LLMs have on domain-specific data, and show promising improvements from the proposed interaction approach. The case study highlights the benefits in an interpretable way.

- In terms of limitations, the dataset is still relatively small scale in the context of training huge LLMs. The expert model used for interaction is also quite small. So there is likely room to push this approach further.

In summary, the paper makes useful contributions around an industry-focused QA dataset, a model interaction paradigm tailored to this problem setting, and an empirical evaluation of the methods. The work aligns well with recent interests in making LLMs more usable in specialized domains. This is an interesting research direction with room for more work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust evaluation metrics and benchmarks for assessing LLMs on domain-specific QA tasks involving long-length responses. The authors propose some initial metrics in this work, but suggest more research is needed in this area.

- Exploring different methods and frameworks for fusing LLMs with domain-specific knowledge. The authors propose a model interaction paradigm in this paper, but note that other approaches could be studied as well. 

- Applying the model interaction framework to other specialized domains beyond just the cloud computing domain focused on in this paper. The authors suggest their approach could be beneficial in domains like law, medicine, etc.

- Incorporating more advanced retrieval methods beyond just BM25 to provide domain knowledge to LLMs. The authors mention dense passage retrieval as one potential direction.

- Studying the integration of other modalities like images, video, audio etc. along with text to provide multi-modal domain knowledge to LLMs. The current work focuses solely on text.

- Expanding the MSQA dataset with more data over time and adding more specialized sub-domains under the broader cloud computing domain.

- Evaluating model interaction approaches on other NLP tasks beyond just QA, such as summarization, generation, translation etc. in specialized domains.

In summary, the main future directions are around developing better evaluation methods for domain-specific LLM tasks, exploring different techniques for fusing external knowledge into LLMs, and applying and scaling up the model interaction framework to other domains, tasks and modalities. Expanding datasets like MSQA could further enable progress in this emerging research area.

How to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific question answering tasks, given their lack of pretraining on domain-specific knowledge. 

The key points related to this problem from the paper are:

- LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, etc. have shown impressive performance on general NLP tasks. However, they struggle on domain-specific problems due to insufficient domain knowledge.

- Fine-tuning LLMs on domain data can be expensive and risky in terms of data privacy.

- The authors propose a new model interaction paradigm to provide LLMs with generated domain knowledge from a fine-tuned small model.

- They create a new cloud domain QA dataset MSQA to benchmark performance.

- Their model interaction approach outperforms retrieval methods on this domain QA task.

In summary, the key problem is enhancing LLMs' performance on domain-specific QA where they lack specialized knowledge, and the solution explored is interacting LLMs with small fine-tuned models to provide generated domain knowledge. The MSQA dataset and model interaction framework are created to facilitate progress on this problem.
