# [Aligners: Decoupling LLMs and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04224)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) need to be aligned with human values and preferences to ensure their safety and usefulness. However, alignment is challenging, expensive, and needs to be repeated for every new LLM. 
- Existing alignment methods rely on curated datasets or reinforcement learning with human feedback, and have to be applied to each model separately.
- Alignment can negatively impact model performance on certain tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
- Decouple LLMs and alignment by training separate "aligner" models that can align any LLM's outputs to desired criteria on an as-needed basis. This reduces the alignment burden.
- Train an "inspector" model to decide when alignment is needed, reducing performance impact.
- Generate synthetic data with LLMs and prompts for training aligners and inspectors. This provides flexibility for various alignment criteria.

Key Contributions:
- Novel idea of decoupled and on-demand alignment using separate aligner and inspector models  
- Method for flexible synthetic data generation to train aligners/inspectors for different criteria
- Recipe for training ethical aligners and inspector, validated empirically showing aligned responses are preferred
- Proposed ecosystem of aligners with shared inspector for robustness and minimizing alignment impact

The core ideas are separating alignment from LLMs into modular aligner models, reducing alignment burden via inspectors, and leveraging LLM-generated synthetic data for flexible training. Together, this enables safer and more useful LLMs.
