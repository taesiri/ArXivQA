# [Backdoor Attacks Against Deep Image Compression via Adaptive Frequency   Trigger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14677)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we perform effective backdoor attacks against deep learning based image compression models?Specifically, the authors investigate injecting backdoors into image compression models via adaptive frequency triggers. They explore different attack objectives such as degrading compression quality or attacking downstream computer vision tasks. The key hypothesis appears to be that by adding adaptive triggers in the frequency domain of images, they can successfully inject multiple backdoors into a single image compression model. Each backdoor is activated by a specific trigger pattern and leads to a malicious effect defined by the attack objective.In summary, the central research question is how to develop a methodology for performing stealthy yet effective backdoor attacks on deep learning based image compression models by using adaptive frequency domain triggers. The hypothesis is that this approach can allow injecting multiple backdoors with different objectives into a single model.
