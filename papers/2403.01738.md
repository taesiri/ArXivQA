# [ComS2T: A complementary spatiotemporal learning system for data-adaptive   model evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing spatiotemporal (ST) learning models assume training and testing data are identically distributed. However, due to rapid urbanization, there are often distribution shifts between training and testing data, both temporally (e.g. changing patterns over time) and spatially (e.g. new regions added). Current models fail to adapt to such out-of-distribution (OOD) data, suffering from generalization and adaptation issues.

Solution - ComS2T:
The paper proposes a prompt-based complementary spatiotemporal learning system (ComS2T) to enable model evolution and adaptation to OOD data. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Decouple the model into two complementary components - a stable "neocortex" that consolidates historical knowledge, and a dynamic "hippocampus" that adapts to new data. This is inspired by neuroscience theories of complementary learning systems in the human brain.

(2) Learn adaptive "prompts" in a self-supervised manner to capture distributions of the main spatial and temporal signals. These prompts act as intermediate variables to deliver distribution shifts from new observations to update the hippocampus.

(3) A two-stage training process of "warm-up" then "prompt-based fine-tuning" to progressively adapt the model conditioned on prompts.

(4) Enable test-time adaptation by fine-tuning the prompts on new test data to update the hippocampus.

Main Contributions:
- First work to couple ideas of complementary learning from neuroscience with spatiotemporal models to enable adaptation.

- Efficient disentanglement of model into neocortex/hippocampus components based on analysis of weight variations during training.

- Self-supervised prompt training method to capture data distributions and enable test-time tuning.

- Demonstrated significant performance gains on real urban datasets under various spatial/temporal shift scenarios, improving over previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, ComS2T enables efficient evolution of spatiotemporal models to handle out-of-distribution data through complementary learning and adaptive prompting.
