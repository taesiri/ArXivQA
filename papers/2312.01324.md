# [MABViT -- Modified Attention Block Enhances Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01324)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Parallel transformer structures perform comparably to standard transformers at large scale due to representation collapse, where input and output values converge in deeper layers. 
- This causes issues when applying parallel structures to vision transformers, resulting in degraded performance compared to standard transformers.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce non-linearity within the attention module by applying GLU-based activation functions to the Value tensor. 
- Helps assign significance to the output of the multi-head attention and alleviate representation collapse.

Contributions:
- Analyze difference in performance of parallel transformer structures at different scales.
- Hypothesize representation collapse causes comparable performance at scale.
- Propose Modified Attention Block (MAB) Vision Transformer with GLU activation on Value tensor.
- MABViT GLU variants outperform standard ViT, with 0.6% boost for PR-SwiGLU S/16 using fewer parameters.
- MABViT also works well with GELU activation.
- Show MABViT captures patterns better and has more potential with increased depth.

In summary, the paper analyzes issues with applying parallel transformers to vision tasks, hypothesizes the underlying reason to be representation collapse, and proposes a novel MABViT architecture that introduces non-linearity via activation functions in the attention module. Key results demonstrate performance improvements over standard vision transformers using this technique.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel vision transformer architecture called MABViT that incorporates gated linear unit activations within the attention block to enhance performance and mitigate representation collapse issues compared to standard transformers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Analyzing the difference in performance of parallel vs standard transformer architectures at different scales, and hypothesizing that representation collapse causes their similarity at large scale.

2) Proposing a novel transformer variant called MABViT that integrates non-linearity inside the attention module using GLU/GELU activation on the Value tensor to partially overcome representation collapse. 

3) Showing that MABViT variants with GLU/GELU outperform standard Vision Transformers, with the PR-SwiGLU S/16 variant improving accuracy by 0.6% with fewer parameters.

4) Demonstrating that all MABViT M/16 variants surpass the standard B/16 architecture while using only half the parameters, highlighting their parameter efficiency.

5) Exhibiting that MABViT variants have greater potential in deep transformers compared to standard architectures.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and analyzing a modified attention block (MAB) for Vision Transformers that enhances performance and efficiency by integrating non-linear activations inside self-attention.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that representation collapse is the underlying reason for the comparable performance of parallel and standard transformer architectures at large scale. What experiments did they conduct to verify this hypothesis and what were the results?

2. The paper proposes applying an activation function to the Value tensor inside the attention module to provide significance to the Multi-Head Attention output. Why was the Value tensor chosen specifically for this modification instead of the Query or Key tensors? 

3. The GLU variant applies an activation function to one half of the Value tensor and performs an element-wise multiplication with the other half. What is the motivation behind increasing the dimension of the Value tensor and using this specific formulation?

4. The paper experiments with both GLU and GELU activation functions. What are the key differences between these activation functions and why might GLU be more suitable for the proposed architecture?

5. The B/16 architecture with the GLU variant exhibited overfitting during experiments. What could be the potential reasons behind this overfitting and how can it be addressed? 

6. How exactly does adding an activation function to the Value tensor help mitigate the representational collapse problem? Does it completely solve the problem or only partially address it?

7. To compensate for the extra parameters introduced by GLU, the dimension of the MLP block was reduced in some experiments. What effect did this have on the overall performance?

8. The paper shows the potential of the proposed architecture using deeper models (18 layers). Why do deeper models accentuate the benefits of the modified attention block compared to baseline transformers?

9. The modified attention block helps the model converge much faster during training compared to baseline ViT. What implications does this have for training efficiency, especially for large datasets?

10. The results motivate further research into utilizing the Value tensor projection layer as a Mixture of Experts. What is a Mixture of Experts and why might the Value tensor be suitable for this role?
