## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in monocular depth estimation:- The key contribution of this paper is providing a large model zoo of depth estimation networks using different backbone architectures like BEiT, Swin, and LeViT. This builds on top of prior work like DPT and MiDaS v2/v3 that explored CNN and ViT backbones. The extensive benchmarking of models based on various backbones is novel.- The approach of using relative depth estimation and training on a diverse mix of datasets follows the methodology of MiDaS v2/v3. So it is an incremental improvement on prior work in that regard. - For the model architectures, this work leverages recent advances like BEiT, Swin, and LeViT that have shown promise on image classification tasks. Adapting these powerful backbones for depth estimation is a logical next step.- The performance numbers achieved are state-of-the-art for monocular depth estimation methods. The best model improves performance by 28% over MiDaS v3.0. This demonstrates the benefits of exploring advanced backbones.- One limitation is that the method still relies on relative depth estimation, whereas some recent works have focused on metric depth estimation. The results are not directly comparable to methods that produce metric depth maps.- The applications discussed for the new models like integration with visual-inertial odometry and image diffusion models are relevant and demonstrate the utility of the high-quality depth estimation enabled by MiDaS v3.1.In summary, this paper makes strong incremental progress on monocular depth estimation by systematically benchmarking a variety of backbone architectures. The performance improvements and model zoo released are valuable contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring newer vision transformer architectures as they become available, such as BEiT v2, BEiT-3, etc. The authors tested the original BEiT but not the follow-up versions, so integrating those could further improve performance.- Trying different combinations of datasets in the training mix beyond the 12 datasets used. The authors found benefits from expanding from 10 to 12 datasets, so additional datasets could help further.- Experimenting with different hook positions and channel numbers when integrating new backbones. The authors mostly followed the hook configurations used for ViT, but these may not be optimal.- Extending the approach of using original image resolutions during training, instead of fixed resolutions, to more datasets beyond just KITTI. The authors tried this for one model and found improved generalization, suggesting promise.- Adapting the training methodology like losses used, optimizer hyperparameters, etc as new techniques arise. The authors used established techniques but future advances could be integrated.- Applying MiDaS models to new applications beyond the ones discussed. The depth estimation capabilities of MiDaS make it suitable for many potential applications.- Developing end-to-end metric depth estimation models that build on MiDaS, rather than doing post-processing. The authors discuss initial work in this direction but more advances are possible.So in summary, the authors point to continually integrating newer vision architectures, adapting the training methodology, and applying MiDaS to new tasks as fruitful future work to explore.
