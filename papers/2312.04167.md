# [Mixture of Dynamical Variational Autoencoders for Multi-Source   Trajectory Modeling and Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04167)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a latent-variable generative model called Mixture of Dynamical Variational Autoencoders (MixDVAE) to model the dynamics of multiple moving sources from mixed observations. It combines a pre-trained dynamical variational autoencoder (DVAE) to capture individual source dynamics with a discrete latent assignment variable associating observations to sources. For each test sequence, MixDVAE inference alternates between updating the approximate posterior of the DVAE latent state, the source position, and the assignment variable via a variational EM algorithm. MixDVAE only requires pre-training the DVAE on an unlabeled single-source dataset, making it weakly supervised and data-frugal. Experiments on multi-object tracking and audio source separation demonstrate MixDVAE's ability to separate sources and estimate smooth trajectories from mixed observations. It outperforms baseline dynamical models and methods trained on annotated multi-source data, especially on long sequences. MixDVAE shows promise for modeling complex multi-source systems without large labeled datasets. Limitations include computational cost and the assumption of source independence.
