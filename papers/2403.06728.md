# [Large Model driven Radiology Report Generation with Clinical Quality   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current radiology report generation (RRG) methods for chest x-rays are not satisfactory against clinical standards. They lack comprehensive analysis of medically significant regions in the images and do not properly reflect clinical errors in the generated reports.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new RRG method called LM-RRG that integrates large language models (LLMs) with clinical quality reinforcement learning. It has three main components:

1) LLM-driven Visual Feature Extractor: Uses an LLM to generate text descriptions of 29 medically significant regions in chest x-rays. These descriptions are used to extract visual features from their corresponding regions in the image, without needing explicit region detection. A global image feature is also extracted.

2) Multimodal Report Generator: Constructs multimodal prompts from visual features and text instruction to guide the decoder of a large multimodal model to generate the radiology report autoregressively. Uses multitask learning with language modeling and disease classification losses.

3) Clinical Quality Reinforcement Learning: Uses the RadCliQ metric that focuses on clinical errors as a reward function to reinforce the report quality using proximal policy optimization, avoiding mode collapse.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of LLMs to extract regional visual features guided by generated text descriptions, avoiding explicit detection
- Multimodal report generation method leveraging recent large multimodal models  
- Clinical quality reinforcement learning strategy tailored for radiology reports using RadCliQ

Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed LM-RRG method for high-quality radiology report generation.
