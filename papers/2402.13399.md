# [Learning and Sustaining Shared Normative Systems via Bayesian Rule   Induction in Markov Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Social norms are informal rules that regulate cooperative behavior in human societies. They help enable decentralized yet stable cooperation.
- For autonomous agents to integrate into human societies, they need to be able to learn and comply with such social norms in a flexible manner. 
- However, norm learning presents an interesting paradox - norms function as shared constraints, yet they are sustained in a decentralized manner via emergence and cultural transmission. 
- Prior reinforcement learning approaches to norm learning struggle to capture this flexibility and complexity.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces "norm-augmented Markov games" which extend Markov games to include agent beliefs over "norm sets" that classify behavior as compliant or violating.
- Agents assume "shared normativity" - that other agents comply with shared norms even if goals conflict. This allows inference of norms from apparent violations of self-interest.
- Norms are represented as structured rules - as prohibitions that forbid effects or obligations that require extended achievement.
- Agents plan compliance with these rules via model-based methods that switch between reward-seeking and obligation-satisfying modes. 
- Agents approximately infer norms via Bayesian rule induction, using a mean-field approximation for efficiency.
 
Main Contributions:
- Formalizes norm learning in sequential decisions as an inference and planning problem.
- Empirically demonstrates rapid acquisition of norms from observations.
- Shows norms enable outcomes like sustainability and social welfare.  
- Models cultural transmission of norms across agent lifetimes.
- Illustrates decentralized emergence of norms from shared intentionality assumptions alone.
- Contrasts symbolic model-based framework with model-free reinforcement learning.
- Provides a normative standard for evaluating alternative learning approaches.

The paper contributes a sophisticated cognitive account of human-like social norm learning, using structured representations and Bayesian inference to capture the flexibility of human normativity often omitted from model-free approaches. It empirically demonstrates how shared norm assumptions enable agents to rapidly acquire and sustain cooperative institutions in a decentralized yet stable manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for decentralized norm learning in multi-agent sequential decision-making environments, where agents infer shared norms from observations of others' behavior, use model-based planning to comply with learned norms, and can thereby sustain normative systems across generations and converge on shared norms through mutual learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a Bayesian framework for decentralized norm learning in long-horizon multi-agent settings, formalized as norm-augmented Markov games (NMGs). The key ideas include:

1) Modeling agents that assume a shared set of norms exist, allowing them to infer norms from observations of others' compliant and violating behavior. This shares normativity assumption enables rapid norm learning.

2) Showing how agents can plan to comply with learned obligation and prohibition norms in a decentralized way. 

3) Demonstrating experimentally that the proposed approach enables agents to rapidly acquire norms from observations, sustain normative systems across generations as norms are transmitted, and converge on shared normative systems through joint learning and compliance.

In summary, the main contribution is a computational framework and set of ideas for how autonomous agents can learn and comply with social norms in a flexible, decentralized way, capturing key properties of human social normativity. The experiments also highlight the feasibility and sample efficiency of Bayesian norm learning.

The paper introduces the concept of norm-augmented Markov games to model the learning and coordination of social norms in multi-agent sequential decision making environments. Key aspects include representing norms as obligations and prohibitions, having agents perform Bayesian rule induction to learn norms from observations, planning using models of norm compliance, and assuming shared normativity to enable decentralized emergence and transmission of norms. The experiments demonstrate phenomena like rapid passive norm learning, collective benefits from compliance, intergenerational stability despite population change, and spontaneous convergence towards shared norms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes norm-augmented Markov games (NMGs) as a framework for modeling norm learning. How does adding priors and posteriors over norm sets to a Markov game allow agents to correlate their beliefs and achieve better coordination compared to a standard Markov game formulation?

2. The paper represents norms using a structured rule-based language. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using an explicit symbolic representation compared to a model-free habit/skill-based approach to norms? When might each approach be more suitable?

3. The paper models norm compliance via both thresholding and sampling from the posterior. What are some of the tradeoffs between these two approaches? When might one approach be preferred over the other? 

4. The intergenerational transmission experiments highlight some difficulties in sustaining obligation norms over generations compared to prohibition norms. What are some potential reasons for why obligations seem harder to transmit? How might the model be extended to better sustain obligations?

5. The paper does not model sanctions and focuses only on intrinsic motivations for norm compliance. How could sanctions be incorporated into the model? What new phenomena might be studied by including sanctions?

6. The Bayesian norm learning approach seems sample efficient but has high computational complexity. How could model-free and model-based learning be combined to get the best of both approaches? What are some ways to make the Bayesian updating more scalable?

7. The paper represents norms using simple logic rules. How might recent advances in large language models allow more natural language-based representations of norms? What are some of the advantages of using natural language norms?

8. The model passively learns norms then complies with them. How could the model be extended to allow more flexible reasoning about when to follow or adapt norms? What cognitive capacities would this require?

9. The emergence experiments show the model can bootstrap itself to shared norms. However, many emergent norms seem "silly". What mechanisms could promote the emergence of more beneficial, functional norms?

10. The paper evaluates the model under different conditions but does not rigorously compare to other approaches. What are the most relevant baseline models that should be compared against experimentally? What specific hypotheses could be tested?
