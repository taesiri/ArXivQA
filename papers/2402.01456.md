# [Convolution kernel adaptation to calibrated fisheye](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01456)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fisheye cameras provide a wide field of view which is useful for many computer vision tasks, but introduce strong radial distortions that negatively impact the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
- There is a lack of large labeled fisheye datasets to train CNNs effectively.
- Standard CNN architectures and convolutions do not transfer well from perspective to fisheye images due to differences in appearance and context.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce calibrated deformable convolution kernels that adapt to the distortion of fisheye images based on the camera calibration parameters.  
- Leverage perspective pre-trained CNNs and use transfer learning with minimal fine-tuning on small fisheye datasets.
- Deform the convolution kernels according to the Kannala-Brandt projection model to match the distortion for each location in the fisheye image.

Main Contributions:
- Novel calibrated deformable convolution implementation for fisheye cameras that adapts kernels to radial distortion based on camera calibration.
- Approach enables flexibility for various fisheye configurations and fields of view.  
- Experiments on monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation demonstrate improved performance over standard convolutions.
- With fine-tuning, achieves competitive results compared to perspective domain without need for large new labeled fisheye datasets.
- Opens ability to effectively adapt high-performing perspective CNNs to emerging fisheye applications.

In summary, the paper introduces calibrated deformable convolutions to adapt CNNs from perspective to fisheye cameras, avoiding the need to retrain models from scratch on large and costly new fisheye datasets. This enables high-performing perspective networks to transfer effectively to fisheye images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to adapt convolutional neural networks trained on perspective images to work with fisheye images by deforming the convolution kernels based on the camera calibration to match the radial distortion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A novel implementation of calibrated deformable convolution for fisheye cameras under the Kannala-Brandt projection model, which could be used with any fisheye camera (even with a field of view wider than 180 degrees).

2) A set of experiments for domain adaptation of well known CNNs to fisheye cameras for several tasks. In particular, the paper shows results with different fields of view, demonstrating that their method allows great flexibility in the camera configurations with minimal effort.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing calibrated deformable convolutions for fisheye cameras to enable domain adaptation of CNNs from perspective to fisheye images, and showing this approach works for different fisheye camera configurations.

The paper proposes a method to adapt convolutional neural networks trained on perspective images to work with fisheye cameras. It does this by using the Kannala-Brandt projection model to deform the convolution kernels to match the distortion caused by the fisheye projection. Experiments on depth estimation and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate improved performance compared to standard convolutions after a short fine-tuning stage. So the key focus areas are fisheye camera modeling, adapting CNNs through calibrated deformable convolutions, and quantitative evaluation on computer vision tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed calibrated convolutions are based on the Kannala-Brandt projection model. What are the key equations of this model that enable computing the convolution offsets? How is the forward and backward projection modeled?

2. The paper mentions adapting the calibration parameters to the feature map resolution using a scaling factor. Why is handling multiple resolutions important for this method? How is the scaling factor defined and used to adjust the parameters?

3. What is the process of positioning and orienting the convolution kernel using the projection rays and anchor pixel? How does proper positioning enable taking the distortion into account?

4. How are the kernel offsets computed from the calibrated projection model? What is the full process that results in a deformed kernel adapted to the fisheye distortion?

5. The method is evaluated on depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Why are these suitable tasks for evaluating the impact of the calibrated convolutions? What metrics are used to compare performance?

6. For the depth experiments, how does the error distribution in Fig. 4 indicate that calibrated convolutions provide better and more precise depth estimates? Why does performance depend on field of view?

7. How do the qualitative segmentation results demonstrate improved performance from calibrated convolutions? What kinds of differences are observed in the segmentations?

8. Why can't images with field of view greater than 180 degrees be rectified? How do the poor rectification results further motivate methods like calibrated convolutions?

9. The paper concludes calibrated convolutions enable faster domain adaptation from perspective to fisheye cameras. What results support this conclusion? Why is less training data needed?

10. How could the proposed approach of integrating calibration in convolutions be extended to other projection models besides Kannala-Brandt? What would be required to adapt it?
