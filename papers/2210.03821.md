# [Large Language Models can Implement Policy Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03821)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can large language models implement policy iteration using only in-context learning, without relying on expert demonstrations or gradient-based training?The key hypothesis appears to be that large language models have emergent in-context learning abilities that can be leveraged to implement policy iteration. Specifically, the prompts provided to the language model can be iteratively updated through trial-and-error interaction with a reinforcement learning environment, allowing the model to improve its policy over time purely through in-context learning. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability and contrasts it with prior work that relies either on expert demonstrations or gradient-based training. The authors test their method on several simple reinforcement learning tasks using the Codex language model, providing evidence that policy iteration can be implemented successfully using only in-context learning.In summary, the central research question is whether large language models can do policy iteration style reinforcement learning using just in-context learning, without other common techniques like demonstrations or gradient updates. The paper provides an algorithm and experiments to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for implementing policy iteration using large language models and in-context learning. Specifically:- They propose an algorithm called In-Context Policy Iteration (ICPI) that uses a large language model (LLM) to implement policy iteration without requiring expert demonstrations or gradient-based training. - ICPI uses the LLM to generate rollouts to estimate Q-values. It iteratively updates the prompt provided to the LLM based on experience in the environment, allowing the LLM's behavior to improve over time.- They demonstrate ICPI on 6 simple RL environments, showing it can quickly learn good policies. They compare performance across different sized LLMs, finding the largest Codex model consistently learns while smaller models struggle.- They provide an ablation study analyzing the impact of different components of ICPI. They also compare to baselines like tabular Q-learning and an algorithm using demonstrations without policy improvement.- The key ideas are using in-context learning to induce a world model and policy from an LLM based on experience, and driving policy improvement by updating the prompts over time. This enables RL without needing gradients or expert demonstrations.In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel algorithm for policy iteration that makes use of the capabilities of large language models and in-context learning to perform reinforcement learning. The paper analyzes the approach empirically and provides evidence it can efficiently learn policies on small RL problems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

This paper proposes a method for implementing policy iteration using large language models and in-context learning, without requiring expert demonstrations or gradient updates to the model weights. The key idea is to iteratively improve the contents of the prompt from which the policy is derived through trial-and-error interaction with a reinforcement learning environment. Experiments on simple domains show the method can quickly learn good policies using an unmodified language model like Codex.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in large language models and reinforcement learning:- The key novelty of this paper is using in-context learning to implement policy iteration in RL tasks, without needing expert demonstrations or gradient updates to the model. Most prior work relies on demonstrations and/or fine-tuning the model, so this is a unique approach.- This work is most comparable to other recent studies exploring in-context learning for RL such as Laskin et al. (2022) and Min et al. (2022). The key difference is this paper's focus on policy iteration specifically, whereas those works study in-context meta-learning more broadly.  - Compared to RL work using LMs without in-context learning, like Decision Transformer, this approach is slower since it requires actual environment interaction. However, it has the benefit of not needing a pre-trained RL model.- Most LM + RL papers focus on complex games like Atari. The simple environments studied here are not as impressive, but better isolate the effect of in-context policy iteration.- The limited scale (in terms of model size and task complexity) is a major limitation compared to state-of-the-art LM research. But this work provides a proof-of-concept that could be scaled up in future work.- The analysis of different LM architectures (Codex vs GPT variants) is an interesting contribution, suggesting model size and training data impact the effectiveness of in-context RL.Overall, I would say this is an interesting exploration of an understudied approach to combining large LMs with RL. The results are preliminary but highlight the potential of in-context policy iteration, and suggest promising directions for future research as LMs continue to scale up.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Testing the ICPI algorithm on more complex reinforcement learning environments as language models continue to improve. The authors state that the environments in this paper were limited by Codex's ability to accurately model the transitions and actions, so advancing language models should allow ICPI to work in more domains.- Exploring how the ICPI approach could be applied to multimodal foundation models like HARP and Generalist Agent. The current implementation uses a text-based prompt format, but the authors suggest the algorithm could potentially work with other input modalities.- Further studying the impact of model size on the effectiveness of ICPI. The results showed that only the largest Codex model (with billions of parameters) was able to consistently demonstrate learning across tasks. The authors conjecture that as larger models are developed, their performance with ICPI may also improve.- Investigating other ways that in-context learning could be leveraged for reinforcement learning, beyond the specific policy iteration implementation proposed. The authors suggest their approach provides a new way of utilizing language models for RL that could lead to further innovations.- Analyzing the theoretical convergence properties and sample complexity of ICPI. The current empirical results are preliminary, but formal analysis could provide insight into the algorithm's theoretical guarantees.In summary, the main future directions involve testing ICPI on more complex and multimodal tasks, studying how model scale impacts it, further exploring in-context RL, and theoretical analysis of the approach. Advancing language models appears key to unlocking the potential of ICPI.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper demonstrates a method for implementing policy iteration using large language models and in-context learning, without requiring expert demonstrations or gradient updates to the model. The proposed In-Context Policy Iteration (ICPI) algorithm uses the language model to compute Q-values by generating rollouts conditioned on the agent's experience replay buffer. It iteratively updates the policy by taking greedy actions according to these Q-values. ICPI is evaluated on six simple RL environments, where it is shown to quickly learn good policies. Comparisons with baselines highlight the contribution of the policy improvement step. Experiments also suggest that large model size is important for the effectiveness of ICPI, as smaller pretrained language models failed to demonstrate learning on most tasks. While the empirical results are limited, the paper proposes a promising approach to leveraging large language models for RL without reliance on demonstrations or model fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method for using large language models (LLMs) to perform reinforcement learning. The key idea is to implement policy iteration completely within the context of a fixed LLM, without updating the model's parameters. Specifically, the LLM is used to generate simulated rollouts by sequentially predicting states, rewards, and actions. These rollouts are used to estimate Q-values for each action in the current state. The action with the highest Q-value is then executed in the real environment. Over time, the experience buffer fills with trajectories generated using this policy improvement process. The prompts provided to the LLM leverage this experience to induce better world models and policies, closing the loop. The method is evaluated on 6 simple RL environments of increasing difficulty. The largest LLM tested, Codex, demonstrated learning on all tasks. Smaller models generally failed to learn good policies, suggesting model scale is important. The approach also outperformed several baselines, including one which used the experience buffer to emulate the LLM's predictions. Overall, the work provides a new way to apply LLMs to RL that avoids reliance on expert demonstrations or model fine-tuning. As LLMs continue to advance, this prompts-based policy iteration approach could enable rapid few-shot learning on more complex tasks.
