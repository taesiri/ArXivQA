# [Calibrating the Confidence of Large Language Models by Eliciting   Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) optimized with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit overconfidence, where the model's confidence level does not match its actual correctness.  
- This is an issue for using LLMs' confidence scores to estimate their knowledge boundaries and build more honest systems.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors decompose LLM confidence into two dimensions: 
    1) Uncertainty - model's uncertainty about the question 
    2) Fidelity - model's fidelity/commitment to its generated answer
- They propose a method to estimate both uncertainty and fidelity in order to calibrate LLM confidence scores. 

Uncertainty Estimation:
- Use information entropy of the distribution of answers sampled multiple times by the LLM for the same question. Higher entropy indicates more uncertainty.

Fidelity Estimation:
- Replace model's selected answer with "All other options are wrong" and check if the model sticks to that answer. If not, replace the new answer and repeat. This builds a "fidelity chain" showing the model's preference order. 
- Assign higher weights to answers higher up in this chain to get fidelity scores.

Overall Confidence = (1 - Uncertainty) x Fidelity

Main Contributions:
- Proposed a novel method to calibrate LLM confidence scores by estimating uncertainty and fidelity dimensions.
- Achieved strong calibration results across multiple models and datasets, without needing model's internal logits.
- Introduced two new metrics - Inverse Pair Ratio (IPR) and Confidence Evenness (CE) - to evaluate calibration quality from different perspectives.
- Detailed analysis and discussion around what constitutes truly well-calibrated confidence scores.
