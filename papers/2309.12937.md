# [Evolving Spiking Neural Networks to Mimic PID Control for Autonomous   Blimps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop an energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNN) controller to accurately control the altitude of an indoor blimp relying solely on onboard sensing and processing?

The key points related to this question are:

- SNNs have potential for lower latency and energy efficiency compared to traditional artificial neural networks, which could be beneficial for robotic control applications with limited onboard power like aerial vehicles. 

- However, training SNNs is more challenging due to their spiking dynamics and non-differentiability. The authors investigate using an evolutionary algorithm for training.

- The authors develop and evaluate SNN controllers for altitude control of an indoor blimp, which is a useful test platform due to its slow dynamics and susceptibility to buoyancy drift. 

- Different hidden layer structures are analyzed, including recurrent connections and input-weighted threshold adaptation (IWTA), to assess their impact on enabling integration within the SNN for buoyancy compensation.

- The evolved SNN controllers, using only 160 spiking neurons, achieve good altitude tracking performance in real-world experiments, minimizing oscillations and steady-state errors from buoyancy drift.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that a small-scale, evolvable SNN can be designed as an efficient neuromorphic controller for altitude stabilization of an indoor blimp, overcoming challenges like oscillations and buoyancy drift. The paper presents the design, training, and experimental validation of such SNN controllers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The development of a fully neuromorphic height controller for a blimp using an evolved spiking neural network (SNN) of only 160 neurons. The SNN controller is able to minimize overshoot/oscillations and eliminate steady-state error caused by the blimp's non-neutral buoyancy. 

2. An analysis of different hidden layer structures (recurrency and input weighted threshold adaptation) for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons in the SNN controller and their effects on performance.

3. Improvements to the hardware of an open-source indoor blimp, including a new LiDAR sensor for more accurate height measurements and an upgraded compute module. 

In summary, the key contribution is showing that a small-scale evolved SNN can achieve accurate and stable control of a blimp's altitude relying solely on onboard sensing and processing. The work examines neural mechanisms like recurrency and IWTA for enabling integration within the SNN. The improvements to the open-source blimp also facilitate further research with this platform.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper develops and tests an energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNN) altitude controller for an indoor blimp, achieving accurate tracking by evolving 2 complementary SNNs to mimic PID control - one for rapid error response and one to handle drift.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on evolving spiking neural networks for robotic control:

- It focuses specifically on applying an evolved SNN for altitude control of a blimp, which is a relatively novel and challenging application compared to more common testbeds like robotic arms or ground robots. The blimp's dynamics and drivetrain limitations make it a good test case for validating the SNN's performance.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates different hidden layer mechanisms (recurrency and IWTA) for enabling integration within the SNN. It analyzes the tradeoffs of these approaches by systematically training and testing SNNs with each structure. This kind of analysis builds on prior work that hand-designed or pre-determined some of the SNN architecture.

- Evolutionary algorithms are used for training the full SNN controller end-to-end, instead of just certain components or connections. This global, exploratory approach to training allows the SNN design to be more flexible and not constrained to local optima.

- The SNN controller runs fully onboard the blimp using a Raspberry Pi CPU, demonstrating a practical implementation. Many prior studies simulate the SNN controller or run it on specialized neuromorphic hardware.

- The SNN achieves good altitude tracking on a real blimp using only 160 spiking neurons. Keeping the network size small highlights the efficiency benefits compared to larger deep neural networks.

Overall, this research makes solid contributions in rigorously analyzing and demonstrating a fully evolved SNN controller on realistic robotic hardware. The lessons on integrating mechanisms and practical training workflows help advance the state-of-the-art in neuromorphic control systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Completing the neuromorphic control loop by integrating event-based sensors and neuromorphic processors. The authors state this would allow them to fully demonstrate the potential benefits of neuromorphic computing for robotic control.

- Exploring alternate training approaches like surrogate gradient methods. The authors used evolutionary algorithms for training due to challenges with gradient-based methods for SNNs, but suggest exploring recent advancements in surrogate gradient techniques as an area of future work.

- Testing the SNN controllers on more complex robots and environments. The blimp is a useful initial test platform, but applying the SNN controllers to systems with higher degrees of freedom and in real-world settings is noted as an important next step. 

- Optimizing the SNN architecture and encoding mechanisms. The authors examined different hidden layer structures, but suggest further work could be done to optimize the overall network topology and spike encoding schemes.

- Hardware implementation with neuromorphic chips like Loihi. The authors cite prior work implementing SNN control on neuromorphic hardware, and suggest this as a direction for their own controllers.

- Expanding the analysis to other types of low-level controllers beyond PID. The authors focused on emulating PID control, but suggest expanding the approach to other classic control schemes.

In summary, the main future directions pointed to are: advancing the neuromorphic computing hardware/software stack, testing the approach on more complex platforms, further optimizing the SNN architecture and encodings, and generalizing the methodology to other types of low-level control problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an evolved spiking neural network (SNN) to control the altitude of an indoor blimp. The SNN parameters were optimized using an evolutionary algorithm and the network was trained to mimic a PID controller. Two complementary SNN controllers were developed - one for rapid error correction and damping oscillations, trained on a PD target signal, and one for minimizing steady state error through integration, trained on an integral target. Different hidden layer mechanisms were analyzed, with a basic LIF structure performing best for the PD controller and IWTA enabling effective integration. The combined 160 neuron SNN controller achieved stable altitude tracking for the non-neutrally buoyant blimp using only onboard sensing and processing. The work demonstrates the potential of small neuromorphic controllers for robotic applications with size and power constraints. Key contributions are the high-performance evolved SNN controller for a blimp, analysis of integration mechanisms in SNNs, and improvements to an open-source blimp platform.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a spiking neural network (SNN) controller for altitude control of an indoor blimp. The SNN parameters were evolved using a covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy to mimic the output of a tuned proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Two separate SNN controllers were developed - one for the derivative and proportional components, and another for the integrator. The proportional-derivative SNN used leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and was trained to provide fast control response while minimizing overshoot and oscillations. The integrator SNN relied on input-weighted threshold adaptation in the hidden layer to perform integration and reduce steady-state errors from non-neutral buoyancy drift. The SNN controllers were validated on an open-source indoor blimp with onboard sensing and processing. Despite drivetrain limitations, the 160 neuron SNN controller achieved accurate tracking of altitude setpoints in the real-world experiments. Oscillations were limited to ±3cm and steady-state errors were reduced from ±5cm to ±2cm compared to prior PID control. The work demonstrates the potential of small-scale neuromorphic controllers for robotic applications with strict power and weight constraints.

In summary, this paper presents the design and real-world validation of a two-part spiking neural network altitude controller for an indoor blimp. The SNN controller, consisting of only 160 spiking neurons, was evolved to mimic a tuned PID controller and achieved improved tracking performance over PID control. The results highlight the capabilities of compact neuromorphic controllers for robotic platforms with limited onboard power and computational resources.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents an approach for developing a spiking neural network (SNN) to control the altitude of a blimp. The SNN controller consists of an encoding layer, a hidden layer, and a decoding layer. The parameters of the SNN, including weights and time constants, are optimized using an evolutionary algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The SNN is trained to mimic the output of a tuned proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller, with one SNN trained on the PD response and another trained on the integral response. The training data consists of error signals recorded from the blimp system or simulated environments. Different hidden layer structures are analyzed, including basic leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons as well as LIF neurons with recurrency or input-weighted threshold adaptation (IWTA). The performance of the SNN controllers is validated by testing them in controlling the altitude of a real-world blimp platform. The combination of the PD and integral SNN controllers is able to effectively stabilize the blimp's altitude by compensating for drift caused by non-neutral buoyancy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the challenge of developing energy-efficient and low-latency controllers for autonomous aerial vehicles like blimps. These vehicles have tight constraints on power and weight, so standard artificial neural networks may not be optimal. 

- The authors propose using spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a more efficient alternative to standard ANNs for control. SNNs encode and transmit information using sparse spike signals like biological brains, rather than continuous values. This could enable event-driven, asynchronous processing that is more power-efficient.

- However, training SNNs is difficult compared to standard ANNs. The authors use an evolutionary algorithm approach to train the SNN controllers, since this is better suited to exploring the complex solution space. 

- They evolve and analyze SNN controllers with different hidden layer structures to control the altitude of a real blimp platform. The SNNs are trained to mimic a PID controller.

- The evolved SNNs demonstrate accurate altitude tracking and stability for the blimp, while using only 160 spiking neurons. This shows the potential of small neuromorphic controllers for autonomous vehicles.

In summary, the key focus is using biologically inspired SNNs trained with evolutionary algorithms to enable power-efficient, low-latency control for autonomous aerial vehicles under tight resource constraints. The blimp platform serves as a challenging test application for validating the SNN controllers.
