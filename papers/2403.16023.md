# [RPMArt: Towards Robust Perception and Manipulation for Articulated   Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Robust perception and manipulation of articulated objects like doors, drawers, etc. is an important capability for real-world robots. However, existing methods have challenges handling noisy point cloud observations from the real world and struggle to transfer from simulation to the real world.  

Proposed Solution - RPMArt Framework

1) RoArtNet - A Robust Articulation Network
     - Learns to estimate articulation joint parameters (axis origin, direction) and affordance points from noisy point clouds
     - Uses a voting scheme based on local features from point tuples rather than global point cloud
     - More robust to noise compared to other backbone networks
     - Incorporates "articulation awareness" by supervising the network to focus on movable joints

2) Affordance-based, Physics-Guided Manipulation
     - Uses estimated affordance point to select a good initial grasp pose 
     - Subsequent manipulation actions constrained by estimated joint parameters
     - Combines semantics and physics

Main Contributions:

- RoArtNet can robustly estimate articulation parameters from noisy point clouds for better sim-to-real transfer
- Complete pipeline for manipulating real-world articulated objects based on robust perception
- State-of-the-art performance on noisy simulation and real-world experiments
- Learns from only synthetic data but transfers zero-shot to real environments

The framework tackles a very practical robotics problem with a novel robust perception approach and achieves impressive real-world performance. The affordance-based semantics combined with physics-based manipulation is also an effective strategy.
