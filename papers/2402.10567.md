# [InSaAF: Incorporating Safety through Accuracy and Fairness | Are LLMs   ready for the Indian Legal Domain?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA show promise for legal applications in tasks like judgment prediction and case summarization. However, they may perpetuate societal biases and unfair discrimination when used in critical domains like law.  
- It is important to study LLMs' performance in legal tasks through the lens of fairness-accuracy tradeoff, especially in the diverse Indian context across axes like religion, caste, gender.

Methodology:
- Authors construct a dataset for binary statutory reasoning to judge law applicability in a situation, with identities spanning gender, religion, caste, region.
- Propose a novel metric - Legal Safety Score (LSS) - to quantify LLMs' usability in legal domain balancing fairness and accuracy. High LSS indicates high group fairness and F1 score.
- Study finetuning pipelines using the dataset to improve LSS of LLaMA and LLaMA-2 models. Compare models finetuned with and without identities.

Key Results:
- LSS effectively determines readiness of LLaMA and LLaMA-2 for legal sector use based on their statutory reasoning accuracy and identity-based fairness.
- Finetuning increases LSS for both models across laws and social groups, showing potential to alleviate bias and enhance usability.
- Similar LSS gains observed for models finetuned with and without identities, guided by "veil of ignorance" theory.

Main Contributions:
- Novel LSS metric balancing fairness and accuracy for quantifying LLM safety in legal domain
- Legal dataset spanning identities and statutory reasoning situations in Indian context   
- Insights into bias mitigation via finetuning to enhance LLM usability in critical sectors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform legal tasks in the Indian context through a novel metric balancing fairness and accuracy, and proposes finetuning methods to mitigate bias and increase model safety.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Developing a dataset to study the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Indian legal domain through the Binary Statutory Reasoning task.

2. Proposing a novel metric called β-weighted Legal Safety Score (LSSβ) to assess the safety of LLMs from a fairness-accuracy tradeoff perspective. This metric encapsulates both the fairness and accuracy aspects of the LLM.

3. Exploring finetuning pipelines, utilizing the constructed legal dataset, as a potential method to increase safety in LLMs. The finetuning procedures are shown to increase the LSS metric for the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 models, improving their usability in the Indian legal domain.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a methodology to evaluate LLMs for the Indian legal domain considering both fairness and accuracy, as well as showing that finetuning can enhance model safety. The proposed LSS metric and finetuning pipelines provide an initial direction for bias mitigation and performance improvement of LLMs for usage in the legal sector.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel metric called Legal Safety Score (LSS). What are the key components that make up this metric and how does it capture both fairness and accuracy? 

2. The paper uses a dataset called Binary Statutory Reasoning with identity (BSR_with_ID) for evaluating the models. What are the different elements that constitute a sample in this dataset? Explain with an example sample.

3. What is the Relative Fairness Score (RFS) proposed in the paper and how is it calculated? Explain its significance in defining the overall LSS metric.

4. The paper studies the behavior of LSS through finetuning the LLMs. Analyze the trends observed for RFS, F1 score and LSS across finetuning checkpoints in Figure 3. What do these trends indicate about the metric?

5. Compare and contrast the finetuning strategies used in the paper - with BSR_with_ID and BSR_without_ID datasets. What is the motivation behind using these strategies?

6. The LSS metric has a hyperparameter β. Explain how the choice of β impacts the importance given to fairness versus accuracy. Analyze the plot in Figure 5 to understand this behavior. 

7. The paper studies the model behavior across various axes of disparities. Pick any one axis and analyze if the overall observations remain consistent when studied independently for that axis in Figure 6.

8. Compare the LSS heatmaps in Figure 7 and interpret how the metric changes for different (law, identity type) pairs as finetuning progresses. What can be inferred?

9. What are some limitations of the constructed datasets and metrics used in evaluating model safety? How can these be enhanced in future work?

10. The paper recommends model usage with human supervision. Discuss ethical considerations for deploying LLMs finetuned using the method proposed here. What risks need to be mitigated?
