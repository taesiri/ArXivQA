# [EasyVolcap: Accelerating Neural Volumetric Video Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06575)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

EasyVolcap is an open-source Python library that provides a unified framework to accelerate research in neural volumetric video modeling, reconstruction, and rendering. It streamlines the pipeline from multi-view video input preprocessing to neural volumetric scene representation to efficient rendering. The modular pipeline includes components like spacetime ray sampling, deformable neural scene representations, appearance modeling, and differentiable rendering. EasyVolcap incorporates state-of-the-art volumetric video algorithms like ENeRF and 4K4D as reference implementations and reusable components. It also provides utilities like an efficient GPU-accelerated viewer and robust configuration system to facilitate rapid experimentation. By open-sourcing a readily extensible framework tailored for volumetric video research, EasyVolcap aims to catalyze innovations in this emerging field of neural dynamic scene representations and immersive content creation.
