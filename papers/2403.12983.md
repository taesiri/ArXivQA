# [OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with   Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12983)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Structured pruning removes entire structures (e.g. channels, neurons, attention heads) from neural networks to reduce inference costs. It allows acceleration on standard hardware unlike unstructured pruning. 
- However, models are sensitive to structured pruning, with significant drops in performance. Most methods require gradual pruning or retraining after each pruning stage, which is prohibitively expensive for large models and datasets.  
- Recent works have focused on the challenging task of one-shot structured pruning without retraining. But existing methods face limitations in computation time, memory usage and balancing utility with structured sparsity.

Proposed Solution - OSSCAR:
- The paper proposes a novel optimization framework for one-shot structured pruning based on a layer-wise reconstruction loss. 
- The loss function is reformulated to significantly reduce the problem scale by exploiting its structure and identifying groups of variables sharing quadratic coefficients.
- A local combinatorial search algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore structures under latency constraints by pruning/swapping components based on importance scores.  
- The algorithm exploits low-rank matrix updates for efficient computation and enjoys strong theoretical guarantees.

Key Contributions:
- Reformulation of layer-wise loss that reduces quadratic matrix scale from hundreds of millions to thousands. Enables optimization of huge models.  
- Local search algorithm with low-rank updates for efficient exploration of structured pruning configurations.
- State-of-the-art one-shot pruning results on large vision models (ResNet50) and language models (up to 30B parameters), with up to 125× lower perplexity and 6-8× faster execution than prior works.
- Handles models with up to 30B parameters for structured pruning, 100× larger than prior works. Very practical in saving time and resources.

In summary, the paper introduces an optimization framework (OSSCAR) for extremely efficient and high-quality one-shot structured pruning of huge vision and language models, with theoretical and empirical advances over state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel optimization framework called OSSCAR for efficient one-shot structured pruning of large vision and language models, which achieves significant improvements in model compression over prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel optimization-based framework, named OSSCAR, for one-shot structured pruning of large vision and language models. The key ideas include reformulating the layer-wise reconstruction objective to exploit problem structure and enable more scalability, as well as developing an efficient local combinatorial optimization algorithm. 

2. The proposed framework is shown to be much more time- and memory-efficient compared to prior approaches. It can handle models with tens of billions of parameters using a single GPU, which is up to 100x larger than what past structured pruning methods could process.

3. OSSCAR achieves considerably better utility-sparsity tradeoffs and inference time speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on vision models (e.g. ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g. OPT-1.3B to OPT-30B). For example, on OPT-2.7B it attains 125x lower test perplexity than ZipLM with 2x speedup, and is 6-8x faster in pruning time.

In summary, the main contribution is a scalable optimization framework for one-shot structured pruning that can handle very large models and achieves superior performance over existing approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a combinatorial optimization reformulation of the structured pruning problem. How does this reformulation compare to common approximate solvers for mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs), in terms of complexity and scalability to problems with hundreds of millions of variables?

2. Algorithm 1 performs local combinatorial search to solve the reformulated problem. How does the algorithm balance exploration (searching very different solutions) and exploitation (refining current good solutions)? Is there a risk of getting stuck in poor local optima? 

3. The optimization reformulation is based on minimizing a layer-wise reconstruction loss. How does this objective compare to other structured pruning objectives, such as minimizing the change in activation distributions or final loss? Are there cases where directly optimizing the end task loss performs better?

4. Proposition 1 shows that the algorithm can efficiently evaluate the objective for neighboring solutions. Does a similar result hold for evaluating gradient-based metrics like Taylor approximations? Could gradient information further improve performance?

5. The method prunes structures independently across layers. How much accuracy improvement could be gained from joint optimization across layers? Would independent layer optimization still be preferable for efficiency?

6. How does the choice of calibration dataset size and content impact the quality of identified structures to prune? Are there guidelines for selecting an appropriate calibration set?

7. The experiments primarily consider channel pruning for CNNs and head/neuron pruning for transformers. How easily can the method extend to other structured pruning schemes like filter pruning or block pruning?

8. The method achieves very strong results on large vision and language models. For what model types or architectures might it face challenges? When might more tailored approaches be preferred?  

9. The paper focuses on one-shot pruning without finetuning. Could the identified structures to prune also effectively initialize an iterative prune-then-finetune approach?

10. The local search algorithm involves several hyperparameters, e.g. number of iterations $T$ and steps sizes $\hat{t}$, $\hat{p}$. While results are shown to be fairly robust, could an adaptive parameter selection scheme based on intermediate solutions further improve performance?
