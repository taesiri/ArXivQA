# [Generalizing Event-Based Motion Deblurring in Real-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05932)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generalize event-based motion deblurring to handle varying spatial and temporal scales in real-world scenarios. 

The key challenges are:

1) How to design a model that can handle frames and events at different spatial resolutions and effectively deblur high-resolution (HR) frames using low-resolution (LR) events.

2) How to train the model using only real-world data without ground truth sharp images, and generalize its performance to handle larger motion blur and different spatial scales beyond the training distribution. 

The hypotheses are:

1) A scale-aware network with multi-scale feature fusion can fuse information from HR frames and LR events for flexible spatial setups.

2) A self-supervised learning framework with proposed brightness/structure consistency constraints and self-distillation can efficiently train the model using only real blurry data, and generalize its performance to varying spatial/temporal scales.

The paper aims to address the limitations of prior event-based deblurring methods that assume fixed spatial/temporal scales and require ground truth data. It proposes a new model and training approach to handle real-world data with no ground truth and generalize across scales. The key novelty is in the network design and self-supervised learning framework to enable generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a scale-aware network that can handle motion deblurring of high-resolution (HR) blurry frames using low-resolution (LR) events. This allows flexible setup of input spatial resolutions and output temporal scales.

2. It presents a two-stage self-supervised learning framework to train the network using real-world data without ground truth images. The first stage ensures brightness and structure consistency of the deblurred results. The second stage generalizes the deblurring performance to varying spatial and temporal scales of motion blur. 

3. It collects and releases a real-world dataset (MS-RBD) containing HR blurry frames and LR events captured using a beam splitter setup. This facilitates research on event-based deblurring using multi-scale real data.

4. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real datasets. It demonstrates superior capability in handling varying blurriness levels and cross-resolution inputs. The self-supervised framework also shows better efficiency compared to previous methods.

In summary, the key contribution is a self-supervised scale-aware motion deblurring framework that can be trained on real LR events and HR blurry frames, and generalize well to varying spatial-temporal scales unseen during training. The release of a new real-world multi-scale blurry dataset also enables future research in this direction.
