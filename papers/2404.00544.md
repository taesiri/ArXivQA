# [Deep Extrinsic Manifold Representation for Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data residing on non-Euclidean manifolds is frequently encountered in computer vision tasks like motion estimation, shape analysis, etc. However, deep neural networks typically generate feature vectors in Euclidean space, which may not be suitable for certain tasks. 
- Prior works have used intrinsic manifold losses to regularize the outputs to lie on the manifold. But these are often complex and difficult to optimize.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Deep Extrinsic Manifold Representation (DEMR) to incorporate extrinsic manifold embeddings into deep neural networks. This allows generating manifold representations without directly optimizing complex intrinsic losses.

- In DEMR, the network generates outputs in an extrinsically embedded Euclidean space. These are then mapped to the manifold through a deterministic inverse mapping. 

- Optimization happens in the embedded space using standard losses. This allows preserving existing network architectures without computational overhead during training.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the concept of incorporating extrinsic manifold regression ideas into deep learning frameworks through DEMR.

- Provides theoretical analysis on feasibility, asymptotic properties and generalization ability of DEMR.

- Validates DEMR on two computer vision tasks - relative pose regression on SE(3) and illumination subspace estimation on Grassmann manifold. Shows improved performance over baseline approaches.

- Demonstrates that encoding geometric structure through DEMR enhances overall performance and generalization ability compared to unstructured deep learning models.

- Establishes computational benefits and easier integration of DEMR over intrinsic manifold losses within deep networks.

In summary, the paper presents a novel perspective to integrate manifold geometry into deep networks through extrinsic embeddings. Theoretical and empirical validations showcase the advantages of this technique.
