# [Steering LLMs Towards Unbiased Responses: A Causality-Guided Debiasing   Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can easily generate biased and discriminative responses, perpetuating and amplifying societal inequities. 
- This is a significant issue as LLMs are being used in consequential decision-making systems across sectors like healthcare and education.
- Most capable LLMs are closed-sourced so parameter-based debiasing methods are infeasible. Prompting techniques are the only option.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a causality-guided debiasing framework that utilizes causal understandings of (1) the data-generating process of the LLM's training corpus, and (2) the LLM's internal reasoning process.
- This is used to guide the design of prompts to debias LLM outputs through selection mechanisms that discourage biased reasoning and encourage unbiased reasoning. 
- Two main strategies: (i) discouraging the use of biased associations and demographic information (reducing spurious reasoning), and (ii) encouraging the use of proper world knowledge and facts (encouraging factual reasoning).

Main Contributions:  
- Detailed causal modeling of training data generation and LLM reasoning, highlighting role of selection mechanisms.
- Principled and unified prompting strategies to debias LLMs guided by causal understandings. 
- Empirical demonstration of strong debiasing performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches.
- Framework provides intuitive and theoretically grounded guidelines for effective LLM debiasing through prompting even with black-box access.

In summary, the paper provides a causality-guided framework for principled prompting strategies to mitigate bias and unfairness issues with LLMs by steering them towards fact-based reasoning. Strong results validate the benefit of utilizing causal knowledge to inform effective debiasing approaches.
