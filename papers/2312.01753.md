## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Rebalanced Contrastive Learning (RCL), a method to improve long-tail classification performance by enhancing the quality of embeddings learned through supervised contrastive learning. RCL addresses three limitations of existing methods: imbalanced feature space allocation across classes, lack of intra-class feature compactness, and insufficient regularization for tail classes. Specifically, RCL adopts class frequency-based softmax loss balancing to equally divide feature space among all classes, compresses same-class embeddings together through scaled features, and enforces wider margins between embeddings using the concept of data-dependent regularization. Experiments conducted on long-tail versions of CIFAR and ImageNet datasets by integrating RCL into the state-of-the-art Balanced Contrastive Learning framework demonstrate consistent improvements in top-1 balanced accuracy. Qualitative evaluations also showcase RCL's ability to learn more balanced and separable embeddings across head and tail classes. The simplicity of RCL's implementation and consistently strong performance make it a promising technique for improving long-tail recognition.
