# [Learned Image Compression with Text Quality Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08643)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learned image compression models can achieve very low bitrates but often suffer from text distortion in images with substantial textual content, especially screen content images (SCIs). Existing methods focus on visual quality and overlook textual content reconstruction. Thus, there is a need for techniques explicitly enhancing text quality in learned image compression.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel text logit loss function designed to measure disparity in textual fidelity between original and reconstructed images. This is calculated by:
1) Detecting and cropping text regions from original and reconstructed images
2) Recognizing text in these regions to obtain character logits 
3) Quantifying logit differences between corresponding text regions
By minimizing this loss during training, text quality is enhanced while maintaining visual quality.

Contributions:
1) First work explicitly focusing on text quality for learned image compression
2) Introduce text logit loss function that can plug-and-play with various compression models
3) Achieved -32.64% BD rate for CER and -28.03% for WER on average across algorithms and datasets
4) Present BD-CER and BD-WER metrics to quantitatively evaluate text reconstruction performance

The experiments on two screenshot datasets across five compression algorithms demonstrate clear improvements in textual quality both quantitatively and qualitatively while maintaining bitrate. The results highlight the efficacy of the text logit loss for text-aware image compression.
