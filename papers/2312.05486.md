# [FreeFlow: A Comprehensive Understanding on Diffusion Probabilistic   Models via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown impressive performance for generative tasks like image generation. However, the underlying connections between the diverse DPM algorithms are not well understood theoretically. 

- A unified framework is lacking to provide a thorough explanation that clarifies the mechanism of DPMs and guides further development.

Proposed Solution - FreeFlow:

- The paper proposes FreeFlow, a framework based on time-dependent optimal transport theory. 

- FreeFlow shows that the diffusion process in DPMs is intrinsically the gradient flow of a free energy functional defined on the Wasserstein space.

- This provides a geometric view where DPM pipelines are gradient flows dissipating the free energy functional as fast as possible towards equilibrium.

Key Contributions:

- Derives the Fokker-Planck equation as a special case of FreeFlow, proving it is the steepest descent of a defined free energy.

- Summarizes mainstream DPM diffusion patterns (Markovian, SDE, ODE) into FreeFlow's unified form. 

- Reveals the danger of shock waves when using Lagrangian particle trajectories and gives the optimality equation from an Eulerian view.

- Emphasizes the impact of formulating cost functions in optimal transport theory for attaining desirable properties.

- Provides a unifying perspective to understand DPM mechanisms and principles more profoundly to guide further improvements.

In summary, FreeFlow is a new theoretical framework for diffusion models using time-dependent optimal transport theory. It encapsulates diverse algorithms in a unified view and reveals essential principles to advance understanding and development of generative DPMs.
