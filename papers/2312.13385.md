# [ORBSLAM3-Enhanced Autonomous Toy Drones: Pioneering Indoor Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13385)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Navigating toy drones (under 250g) through unknown GPS-denied indoor spaces is challenging due to reliance on GPS for positioning. Requires methods for mapping, localization, and path planning.
- ORB-SLAM3 is a promising SLAM system for this, but generates sparse point clouds prone to outliers. Point clouds also don't distinguish between obstacles and free space clearly.
- Path planners typically require dense representations of obstacles with clear boundaries.

Proposed Solution:
- An autonomous real-time indoor exploration system for toy drones with a monocular camera.
- Uses ORB-SLAM3 for localization and mapping.
- Outlier removal algorithm based on minimax optimization of a jointly-submodular function. Provides theoretical guarantees on outlier removal.  
- Novel exit detection algorithm that transforms the 3D point cloud to a 2D-style map mimicking LiDAR, then detects largest gap as an exit point.
- Clustering and convex hull generation to transform the point cloud into free space and obstacle representations usable by path planners.
- RRT path planner used with path refinement.

Main Contributions:
(i) Outlier removal with guarantees
(ii) Exit point detection for exploration
(iii) Point cloud transformation for path planning
(iv) Complete autonomous exploration system demonstrated on a <$100 toy drone with only a camera

The system is validated through offline analysis and real-time experiments showing it can effectively explore unknown indoor spaces. Future work includes operation on more constrained hardware and incorporating deep learning.
