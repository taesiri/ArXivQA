 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes Vary, an effective and efficient method for scaling up the visual vocabulary of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Existing LVLMs rely on a fixed CLIP-based vision vocabulary which has limitations in handling some specialized visual tasks requiring dense perception, like document OCR and chart understanding. Vary addresses this through a two-step approach - first generating a new vision vocabulary tailored for such tasks via a vocabulary network and tiny transformer trained on synthetic document and chart image-text pairs, and then integrating this with the original CLIP vocabulary into the LVLM, with both vocabularies frozen during downstream tuning. Experiments demonstrate Vary's superior fine-grained visual perception on tasks like Chinese/English dense OCR and document conversion to LaTeX/markdown while also performing on par or better on downstream datasets like DocVQA, ChartQA and MMVet. The simple yet effective strategy of expanding visual vocabulary opens up avenues for strengthening LVLMs on a wider range of visual tasks.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Vary: Scaling up the Vision Vocabulary for Large Vision-Language Models":

Problem:
- Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) rely on the same limited vision vocabulary (CLIP-VIT) which works well for common visual tasks but struggles with specialized tasks needing fine-grained perception (e.g. non-English OCR, document/chart understanding). 
- Updating the vision vocabulary by fine-tuning risks overwriting knowledge and is inefficient due to LLM memory.
- There is a need for an efficient way to expand the visual vocabulary to handle specialized fine-grained vision tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Vary - a method to efficiently generate and integrate an expanded vision vocabulary to enhance LVLMs.
- Vary has two components:
   1) Vary-tiny - a small vision encoder and decoder that generates a new vision vocabulary via autoregression on specialized vision data.
   2) Vary-base - the full LVLM formed by integrating the new vocab with the original CLIP vocab, keeping both fixed after merging.
- Specialized data includes rendered LaTeX documents, charts, and natural images. The new vocab focuses on fine-grained tasks like OCR while retaining general knowledge.

Contributions:
- An efficient and user-friendly approach to expand the visual vocabulary of LVLMs to handle specialized fine-grained vision tasks.
- Vary-tiny to generate task-specific vision vocabularies via autoregression.
- Integration method to combine new and original vision vocab while avoiding overwriting knowledge.
- Promising results showing enhanced fine-grained perception for tasks like OCR and chart/document understanding.
- Establishes the importance of scaling up visual vocabularies for LVLMs.

In summary, Vary provides an effective strategy to enhance LVLMs for fine-grained vision tasks by generating and integrating an expanded specialized vision vocabulary.
