## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes Vary, an effective and efficient method for scaling up the visual vocabulary of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Existing LVLMs rely on a fixed CLIP-based vision vocabulary which has limitations in handling some specialized visual tasks requiring dense perception, like document OCR and chart understanding. Vary addresses this through a two-step approach - first generating a new vision vocabulary tailored for such tasks via a vocabulary network and tiny transformer trained on synthetic document and chart image-text pairs, and then integrating this with the original CLIP vocabulary into the LVLM, with both vocabularies frozen during downstream tuning. Experiments demonstrate Vary's superior fine-grained visual perception on tasks like Chinese/English dense OCR and document conversion to LaTeX/markdown while also performing on par or better on downstream datasets like DocVQA, ChartQA and MMVet. The simple yet effective strategy of expanding visual vocabulary opens up avenues for strengthening LVLMs on a wider range of visual tasks.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Vary: Scaling up the Vision Vocabulary for Large Vision-Language Models":

Problem:
- Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) rely on the same limited vision vocabulary (CLIP-VIT) which works well for common visual tasks but struggles with specialized tasks needing fine-grained perception (e.g. non-English OCR, document/chart understanding). 
- Updating the vision vocabulary by fine-tuning risks overwriting knowledge and is inefficient due to LLM memory.
- There is a need for an efficient way to expand the visual vocabulary to handle specialized fine-grained vision tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Vary - a method to efficiently generate and integrate an expanded vision vocabulary to enhance LVLMs.
- Vary has two components:
   1) Vary-tiny - a small vision encoder and decoder that generates a new vision vocabulary via autoregression on specialized vision data.
   2) Vary-base - the full LVLM formed by integrating the new vocab with the original CLIP vocab, keeping both fixed after merging.
- Specialized data includes rendered LaTeX documents, charts, and natural images. The new vocab focuses on fine-grained tasks like OCR while retaining general knowledge.

Contributions:
- An efficient and user-friendly approach to expand the visual vocabulary of LVLMs to handle specialized fine-grained vision tasks.
- Vary-tiny to generate task-specific vision vocabularies via autoregression.
- Integration method to combine new and original vision vocab while avoiding overwriting knowledge.
- Promising results showing enhanced fine-grained perception for tasks like OCR and chart/document understanding.
- Establishes the importance of scaling up visual vocabularies for LVLMs.

In summary, Vary provides an effective strategy to enhance LVLMs for fine-grained vision tasks by generating and integrating an expanded specialized vision vocabulary.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Vary, an efficient and effective method to scale up the vision vocabulary of large vision-language models by generating and integrating a new specialized vocabulary to improve fine-grained visual perception while maintaining general capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Vary, an efficient and effective method to scale up the vision vocabulary of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Specifically:

1) Vary introduces a new vision vocabulary generation process, including a vocabulary network and a tiny decoder-only transformer, to produce a powerful new vision vocabulary via auto-regression. This new vocabulary compensates for deficiencies of the original CLIP-based vocabulary.

2) Vary proposes a method to integrate the new vocabulary with the original one in LVLMs, enabling the models to quickly garner new visual features without overwriting original knowledge. 

3) Experiments show Vary maintains strong performance on original tasks while achieving more excellent fine-grained perception and understanding abilities, such as document-level OCR, chart understanding, etc.

In summary, Vary provides an effective strategy to strengthen the visual vocabulary of LVLMs for better fine-grained visual perception, which is the main contribution. The idea of scaling up the vision vocabulary is highlighted as an important direction for future LVLMs.

- Document understanding - A key application area explored is using the expanded vocabulary to improve perception of documents, tables, math formulas for tasks like OCR and markdown conversion.

- Chart understanding - Another application area is understanding charts, especially in non-English scenarios where CLIP vocabulary falls short.

- Fine-grained perception - Goal of vocabulary expansion is to improve fine-grained visual perception for tasks like dense OCR that CLIP struggles with.

- Synthetic data - Use of synthetically generated document images with latex and chart rendering to train models.

- Evaluation - Models are evaluated on custom OCR test sets, DocVQA, ChartQA and general MM-Vet benchmarks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called Vary to scale up the vision vocabulary for large vision-language models. What are the key motivations and issues with existing methods that Vary aims to address? 

2. The paper divides Vary into two components - Vary-tiny and Vary-base. What is the purpose of each component and how do they work together? Please explain the workflow.

3. What kind of vision tasks does Vary focus on that existing vision vocabularies like CLIP may not handle well? Why are these tasks more challenging?

4. The paper uses a vocabulary network plus a tiny transformer decoder to generate the new vision vocabulary. Why is this auto-regressive approach better suited than contrastive learning used by CLIP?

5. What are the key differences in data used for generating the vocabulary versus scaling it up later? Why are both synthetic and natural images needed?

6. Explain how the new and old vision vocabularies are integrated in Vary-base. Why is freezing both vocabularies important after merging them?  

7. How does the training process and data for Vary-base differ from existing methods like LLaVA? What prompts are used to control different functions?

8. Why is using Qwen versus Vicuna as the LLM important for handling Chinese language tasks? How are the conversation formats customized for each?

9. Analyze the quantitative results showing Vary's performance on document parsing, DocVQA, ChartQA. What insights do these provide about the method?

10. What other potential applications could benefit from scaling up the vision vocabulary? What future work could be done to improve Vary?
