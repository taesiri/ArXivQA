# [SemPool: Simple, robust, and interpretable KG pooling for enhancing   language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SemPool: Simple, robust, and interpretable KG pooling for enhancing language models":

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) can improve question answering (QA) by providing additional factual information. Most successful KG-QA methods use graph neural networks (GNNs) to aggregate information from the KG. 
- However, GNNs rely on graph connectivity and struggle when critical answer information is missing from the KG, making them not robust. In addition, representation mismatch between language models (LMs) and external KG embeddings makes fusing information between the two modalities challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose SemPool, a simple graph pooling method to enhance LMs with robust KG semantics. 
- SemPool represents each KG fact with the LM to enable representation alignment. It then performs weighted aggregation over all fact representations to obtain a single KG representation.
- This KG representation is fused into different layers of the LM via a special [Graph] token, grounding the LM's reasoning on KG semantics.

Main Contributions:
- SemPool demonstrates robust QA performance when answer information is missing from the KG, outperforming GNNs by 2.27% on average. In easier settings, it remains competitive.
- Aligning KG and LM representations is shown to be important for performance. Late fusion of KG information into multiple LM layers works better than early fusion.
- Analysis shows SemPool identifies different KG semantics useful for different LM layers, enhancing interpretability.
- When combined with a message passing approach like GSC, SemPool sets a new SOTA on OBQA dataset, showing potential.

In summary, SemPool provides a simple and robust approach to inject global KG semantics into LMs for improved and interpretable QA. Its simplicity, robustness to perturbations, and interpretability are the main strengths.
