# [Coherent Temporal Synthesis for Incremental Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most prior works in incremental learning for videos simply store exemplar frames for data replay, neglecting the unique temporal properties of videos. Storing frames imposes a tradeoff between dense temporal sampling and memory diversity. Generative replay approaches used in images have not been explored for the video domain.  

Solution:
This paper proposes a novel temporally coherent action (TCA) model for generating diverse and temporally coherent action segments for video replay in incremental action segmentation. 

Key ideas:
- Uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to model actions, allowing efficient representation with fixed model size.
- Introduces a temporal coherence variable to capture the relative progression within an action segment. This helps model the evolution of features over the course of an action.
- Replay generation is top-down - first sample segment durations and order, then use TCA decoder to generate segments features which are concatenated.

Contributions:
- First work to explore incremental learning for temporal action segmentation, going beyond standard recognition.
- Proposes generative replay for videos using TCA model, sidestepping frame exemplar tradeoffs. 
- TCA incorporates temporal coherence for coherent replay, unlike prior image/video generative replay.
- Experiments show significant gains over baselines in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, on Breakfast and YouTube Instructional datasets.

In summary, this paper makes an important first step in designing video-specific data replay techniques for incremental learning that maintain temporal continuity critical for action understanding tasks.
