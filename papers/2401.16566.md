## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate dynamic parameter identification is critical for intuitive physical human-robot interaction and co-manipulation of robotic arms. However, existing methods have challenges when dealing with varying end-effectors.  
- Selecting optimal excitation trajectories for system identification is difficult, especially when needing to consider self-collision avoidance constraints. Prior methods are either not computationally efficient or unable to find feasible solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach to generate optimal and feasible excitation trajectories for dynamic parameter identification of robotic manipulators. 
- It introduces a computationally efficient cost function based on the condition number's upper bound to optimize trajectory generation.  
- It incorporates self-collision avoidance by approximating links as ellipsoids and formulating this as constraints in the optimization.
- It uses a two-step nonlinear optimization strategy to find solutions efficiently.

Contributions:
- Novel excitation trajectory optimization method for dynamic parameter identification of robots, ensuring self-collision avoidance.
- New cost function based on the condition number's upper bound, enabling efficient computation.
- Implementation and validation on a 7-DoF medical robot (KUKA LBR Med).
- Demonstrated 30.1% lower workload for users during a co-manipulation task compared to standard methods, quantified using the NASA TLX questionnaire.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient approach to generating optimal excitation trajectories for identifying robot dynamic parameters that considers self-collision. It is validated through experiments, and enables lower workload physical human-robot interaction.
