# [Adaptive Robot Coordination: A Subproblem-based Approach for Hybrid   Multi-Robot Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is challenging when there are many robots that require high levels of coordination. 
- Existing methods struggle to provide both scalability (handling many robots) and precise coordination.
- Coupled methods explore the joint state space directly which allows coordination but don't scale well. 
- Decoupled methods plan paths individually which scales but lacks coordination.
- Hybrid methods transition between decoupled and coupled planning but may still fail due to insufficient coordination states.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Adaptive Robot Coordination (ARC), a hybrid MRMP method based on formulating robot conflicts as local subproblems.  
- Subproblems enable focused search in relevant regions of the joint state space to find coordination motions.
- Subproblems are adapted dynamically based on the specific coordination needs - selecting involved robots, search space region, and planning methods.
- This allows ARC to transition between decoupled and various levels of coupled planning, enabling scalability and adaptive coordination.

Contributions:
- A novel subproblem-based approach to resolve robot conflicts for MRMP.
- An adaptive hybrid MRMP method that leverages subproblems to transition between decoupled and coupled planning spaces.
- Experimental evaluation showing ARC outperforming decoupled, coupled and other hybrid baselines in scenarios needing many robots and high coordination.
- ARC is the only method that can solve all test scenarios, showcasing simultaneous scalability and precise coordination.

In summary, the key idea is using adaptable subproblems to focus computational effort on critical regions needing coordination between robots. This enables a hybrid exploration strategy that transitions between decoupled and coupled spaces to balance scalability and coordination for efficient MRMP.
