# [UMIE: Unified Multimodal Information Extraction with Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03082)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current multimodal information extraction (MIE) methods often use task-specific models, limiting generalizability across tasks and failing to leverage shared knowledge. This requires building separate models for each task, which is time-consuming.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes UMIE, a unified multimodal information extractor based on instruction tuning and large language models. UMIE unifies MIE tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction and event extraction into a text generation problem.

- UMIE consists of four key components: 1) Text encoder for encoding instructions and text; 2) Visual encoder to encode images and detect visual objects; 3) Gated attention module to dynamically integrate textual and visual information; 4) Text decoder to generate extraction results.  

- UMIE is trained with instruction tuning to perform different MIE tasks based on given instructions. A visual gate is used to control the contribution of visual features based on relevance.

Key Contributions:

- UMIE is the first unified extractor covering major MIE tasks using instruction tuning and large language models.

- Extensive experiments show UMIE outperforms prior task-specific models on 6 MIE datasets. The single model also shows strong generalization, robustness to variant instructions and interpretability.

- Analysis provides insights into the role of visual information and validates the effectiveness of the gated attention mechanism.

- The work serves as a stepping stone towards unified information extraction and opens up new research avenues into instruction tuning for MIE.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach unifying major MIE tasks via instruction tuning over large language models. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes UMIE, an end-to-end model that unifies different multimodal information extraction (MIE) tasks into a text generation problem using instruction tuning. This is the first step towards a unified MIE model.

2. It designs a visual encoder and gated attention module to dynamically integrate visual clues from images for robust cross-modal feature extraction in MIE tasks. 

3. Extensive experiments show that a single UMIE model outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across six MIE datasets on three tasks - multimodal named entity recognition, multimodal relation extraction, and multimodal event extraction. This demonstrates UMIE's effectiveness and versatility.

4. In-depth analysis shows UMIE's strong generalization ability in the zero-shot setting, robustness to instruction variants, and interpretability via the gated attention module.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first unified MIE model UMIE which leverages instruction tuning and outperforms previous task-specific models across multiple datasets while demonstrating strong generalization, robustness and interpretability.
