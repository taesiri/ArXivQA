# [Global-to-Local Modeling for Video-based 3D Human Pose and Shape   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14747)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively model both long-term and short-term temporal correlations in video-based 3D human pose and shape estimation.  

The key hypotheses are:

1) Structurally decoupling the modeling of long-term and short-term correlations can lead to better performance compared to using coupled modeling structures like RNNs or attention blocks.

2) A global transformer can effectively capture long-term dependencies and motion continuity. 

3) A local transformer and hierarchical spatial regressor can help exploit short-term inter-frame details and learn intra-frame human mesh structures.

4) Combining the global and local modeling in a collaborative framework improves both intra-frame accuracy and inter-frame smoothness compared to previous methods.

The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Transformer (GLoT) framework with two main branches - Global Motion Modeling and Local Parameter Correction - to validate these hypotheses. Experiments on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with lower model complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Global-to-Local Transformer (GLoT) for video-based 3D human pose and shape estimation, which decouples the modeling of long-term and short-term temporal correlations. 

2. It introduces two key components in GLoT: Global Motion Modeling and Local Parameter Correction to learn inter-frame global-local contexts and intra-frame human mesh structure respectively.

3. It proposes a Masked Pose and Shape Estimation strategy in Global Motion Modeling to help the global transformer better capture long-term dependencies. 

4. It designs a Hierarchical Spatial Correlation Regressor in Local Parameter Correction to refine the global estimation using implicit kinematic constraints.

5. Extensive experiments show that GLoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP and Human3.6M datasets, while having the lowest model parameters compared to previous methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel GLoT framework that decouples global and local modeling through dedicated components to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in video-based 3D human pose and shape estimation. The proposed strategies such as Masked Pose and Shape Estimation and Hierarchical Spatial Correlation Regressor also demonstrate effectiveness.
