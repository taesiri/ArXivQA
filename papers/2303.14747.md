# [Global-to-Local Modeling for Video-based 3D Human Pose and Shape   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14747)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively model both long-term and short-term temporal correlations in video-based 3D human pose and shape estimation.  

The key hypotheses are:

1) Structurally decoupling the modeling of long-term and short-term correlations can lead to better performance compared to using coupled modeling structures like RNNs or attention blocks.

2) A global transformer can effectively capture long-term dependencies and motion continuity. 

3) A local transformer and hierarchical spatial regressor can help exploit short-term inter-frame details and learn intra-frame human mesh structures.

4) Combining the global and local modeling in a collaborative framework improves both intra-frame accuracy and inter-frame smoothness compared to previous methods.

The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Transformer (GLoT) framework with two main branches - Global Motion Modeling and Local Parameter Correction - to validate these hypotheses. Experiments on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with lower model complexity.
