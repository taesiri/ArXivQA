# [MWSIS: Multimodal Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation with 2D Box   Annotations for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06988)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multimodal weakly supervised instance segmentation (MWSIS) framework that trains both 2D image and 3D point cloud segmentors using only 2D box annotations as supervision. To address the low signal-to-noise ratio of weak supervision, the framework incorporates various fine-grained pseudo label generation and correction modules in each modality, including instance-based, spatial-based, point-based, and ring segment-based modules. These enhance instance segmentation performance and improve pseudo label quality. To exploit complementary multimodal information, a Consistency Sparse Cross-Modal Supervision module is introduced to align predictions across modalities through response distillation. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, with 2.59% and 12.75% mAP increases on 2D and 3D instance segmentation respectively. The 3D segmentor also outperforms full supervision using only 5% labeled data, and serves as an effective pre-training technique for downstream 3D tasks. Key innovations include simultaneous multimodal segmentation from sole 2D supervision, extensive pseudo label refinement, and cross-modal distillation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel multimodal weakly supervised instance segmentation framework called MWSIS that trains both 2D and 3D segmentors using only 2D box annotations by leveraging complementary information from images and point clouds through various fine-grained label correction modules and cross-modal distillation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are summarized in four folds:

1. To the best of their knowledge, they are the first to use the 2D box annotations as the sole external supervision signal to train both image and point cloud instance segmentors simultaneously.

2. They propose various fine-grained label correction modules for different modalities, including instance-based, spatial-based, point-based, and ring segment-based modules. These modules not only enhance the instance segmentation performance, but also improve the quality of the pseudo label. 

3. They propose a novel cross-modal supervision method, named CSCS, which exploits the complementary properties of the point cloud and image modalities. This method improves the performance of the segmentors.

4. Their framework can be used as a pre-training method to improve the performance of 3D downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel multimodal instance segmentation framework that trains both 2D and 3D segmentors using only 2D box annotations, through various label correction modules and cross-modal supervision. The framework also serves as an effective pre-training model for other 3D tasks.

- Label correction modules - Several modules are introduced to refine and correct the noisy pseudo labels, such as IPG, SPG, PVC, RSC.

- Cross-modal supervision - A novel consistency sparse cross-modal supervision (CSCS) method is proposed to ensure alignment between the outputs of the multimodal student segmentors. 

- Response distillation - The concept of knowledge distillation is used in CSCS module to transfer responses from teacher to student segmentors cross different modalities.

- Pre-training for 3D tasks - It is shown that the 3D segmentor pretrained by the framework can benefit various downstream 3D tasks when finetuned, outperforming full supervision given very limited labeled data.
