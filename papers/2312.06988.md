# [MWSIS: Multimodal Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation with 2D Box   Annotations for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06988)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multimodal weakly supervised instance segmentation (MWSIS) framework that trains both 2D image and 3D point cloud segmentors using only 2D box annotations as supervision. To address the low signal-to-noise ratio of weak supervision, the framework incorporates various fine-grained pseudo label generation and correction modules in each modality, including instance-based, spatial-based, point-based, and ring segment-based modules. These enhance instance segmentation performance and improve pseudo label quality. To exploit complementary multimodal information, a Consistency Sparse Cross-Modal Supervision module is introduced to align predictions across modalities through response distillation. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, with 2.59% and 12.75% mAP increases on 2D and 3D instance segmentation respectively. The 3D segmentor also outperforms full supervision using only 5% labeled data, and serves as an effective pre-training technique for downstream 3D tasks. Key innovations include simultaneous multimodal segmentation from sole 2D supervision, extensive pseudo label refinement, and cross-modal distillation.
