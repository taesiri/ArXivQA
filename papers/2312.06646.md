# [Computational Copyright: Towards A Royalty Model for AI Music Generation   Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06646)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the copyright challenges posed by AI-generated music, with a focus on the economic implications and the need for effective royalty models. Through case studies of Spotify and YouTube, the authors highlight common practices where revenue is pooled and distributed based on access frequency of copyrighted content. They suggest AI music platforms could adopt similar models, where revenue is attributed back to influential training data. However, accurately quantifying this influence on the AI-generated output is an open challenge. The authors propose a solution using data attribution techniques from machine learning, evaluating both segment-level and more fine-grained event-level attribution. Experiments demonstrate reasonable effectiveness in correlating estimated attribution with ground truth influence. Both the machine learning notion of influence and musical style similarity metrics align with the proposed solution. Overall, this work represents an initial prototype for a computational copyright mechanism that integrates technical advancements in AI with economic considerations in copyright law. Further development of such computational solutions will be critical for enabling royalty models on AI generation platforms.
