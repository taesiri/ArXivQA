# [Utilizing Model Residuals to Identify Rental Properties of Interest: The   Price Anomaly Score (PAS) and Its Application to Real-time Data in Manhattan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17287)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel metric called the Price Anomaly Score (PAS) to identify rental properties in Manhattan that are overpriced or underpriced relative to market rates. The authors scraped real-time rental listings data from StreetEasy to train machine learning models to predict prices. They selected an XGBoost model which explained 79% of price variance. Unlike conventional approaches that view prediction errors as inaccuracies, the authors posit that residuals reveal insights, especially when models generalize well. PAS combines the relative price deviation between actual and predicted prices with the residual's z-score to capture significant deviations, adjustable by a threshold parameter q. By comparing the distribution of PAS values versus z-scores alone, the authors demonstrate PAS better identifies pricing boundaries. This enables flagging of properties as overpriced, underpriced or fair-priced. The authors surface an underpriced apartment example with low PAS, discuss implications for renters and limitations regarding StreetEasy data exclusivity, market volatility and subjectivity. Overall, this innovative study puts forth PAS as a promising multifaceted metric for identifying mispriced rental properties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel metric called the Price Anomaly Score (PAS) to identify overpriced and underpriced rental properties in Manhattan by analyzing the residuals between actual and predicted prices from a machine learning model fitted on real-time data scraped from StreetEasy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of the Price Anomaly Score (PAS), a new metric for identifying overpriced and underpriced rental properties. Specifically:

- The PAS metric incorporates both the relative magnitude of the pricing discrepancy (actual price vs predicted price) as well as the statistical significance in terms of standard deviations from the mean (z-score). This allows it to provide a more robust quantification of pricing anomalies compared to just using the z-score alone.

- The paper proposes a methodology for setting thresholds on the PAS to categorize properties as overpriced, underpriced or fair-priced. This involves selecting a q parameter to fine-tune the upper and lower bounds. 

- Analysis shows PAS has a more normal distribution compared to just using the raw z-scores of residuals, allowing for more meaningful thresholds.

- The PAS relies on having an underlying predictive model that achieves certain accuracy criteria. The paper demonstrates generating such a model using gradient boosting trees.

In summary, the key contribution is the PAS metric for effectively identifying rental property pricing anomalies by combining relative price discrepancies with statistical significance. The paper also provides a methodology for applying PAS in practice.

The paper introduces a new metric called the Price Anomaly Score (PAS) to identify overpriced and underpriced rental properties in Manhattan using model residuals. It collects real-time rental listing data from StreetEasy via web scraping and uses machine learning models like gradient boosting trees to predict prices. The residuals from the predictions are then analyzed through the PAS metric to categorize properties as overpriced, underpriced or fair priced. Feature engineering and SHAP values are also utilized to understand feature importance. The focus is on leveraging real-time data and model residuals to gain insights into the Manhattan rental market.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called the Price Anomaly Score (PAS) to identify overpriced and underpriced properties. How is PAS mathematically defined and what are the key components it depends on? Explain in detail.

2. What are the key assumptions and criteria that need to be met before applying the Price Anomaly Score according to the paper? Discuss each in detail. 

3. The paper compares the distribution of PAS values to the distribution of Z-scores. What differences were observed between these two distributions and what implications did the authors draw from this analysis about the effectiveness of PAS versus using Z-scores alone?

4. Explain the price category classification methodology based on PAS thresholds in depth. What is the significance of the 'q' parameter and how can it be appropriately selected?  

5. Discuss the concept of model residuals and why the authors argue that not all errors from a machine learning model should be treated equally. How does PAS specifically address this?

6. One of the benefits highlighted in the paper is using real-time data from StreetEasy. In your opinion, what are some key advantages and potential limitations of relying solely on data from this single platform?

7. The paper fits multiple machine learning models and uses gradient boosting trees as the final model. Justify why this model was selected and discuss any limitations you see in the model selection process.  

8. The assumption of normality of the distribution of residuals is required for applying PAS. Critically analyze how violations of this assumption may impact the effectiveness of PAS and the subsequent valuation classifications.

9. The threshold 'q' introduces an element of subjectivity in the PAS methodology. Suggest ways in which this subjectivity could be reduced to make PAS more objective and universally applicable. 

10. The paper demonstrates an example of using PAS to identify an underpriced 1-bedroom apartment on Broome Street. Walk through this example analysis in detail and discuss any additional visualizations that could augment interpretation.
