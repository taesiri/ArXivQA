# [ConspEmoLLM: Conspiracy Theory Detection Using an Emotion-Based Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06765)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading online are major threats to society. Detecting them automatically is challenging but important.  
- Existing detection methods using large language models (LLMs) have limitations: only do binary classification; do not consider affective features like sentiment and emotions which are related to misinformation spread.

Solution:
- The paper first analyzed two conspiracy theory datasets and showed emotion and sentiment features are distinct for conspiracy vs mainstream texts.  
- A multi-task conspiracy theory instruction tuning dataset (ConDID) was created covering judgment, topic detection and intention tasks.
- ConspEmoLLM was proposed - an open-source LLM specialized for diverse conspiracy detection tasks by fine-tuning an emotion-based LLM using ConDID dataset.

Contributions:
- Analysis showing distinctive affective features of conspiracy theories
- ConDID - first multi-task conspiracy theory instruction tuning dataset
- ConspEmoLLM - open-source emotion-based LLM for diverse conspiracy tasks 
- Evaluation showing ConspEmoLLM outperforms other open-source LLMs and even ChatGPT on conspiracy detection tasks, proving effectiveness of incorporating affective information

In summary, the key innovation is developing an emotion-based open-source LLM specialized for multi-faceted conspiracy theory detection, enabled by a new instruction tuning dataset ConDID. Performance gains prove value of affective features and advantages over existing models.
