# [Harmonizing Visual and Textual Embeddings for Zero-Shot Text-to-Image   Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on zero-shot text-to-image customization methods that allow generating images of a user-provided subject in various contexts guided by text prompts. These methods encode an image of the subject into a visual embedding and concatenate it with a textual embedding from the prompt. However, when attempting to change the pose of the subject through the text prompt, two main problems arise:
(i) Pose bias - The generated images tend to maintain the pose of the subject in the input image instead of constructing the novel pose indicated in the text prompt. 
(ii) Identity loss - The identity of the subject in the generated images is often altered, with changes to color, body shape etc.

These problems originate from an inherent conflict between the visual embedding (which carries pose information from the input image) and textual embedding (which provides new pose information). The visual embedding interferes with the textual embedding, restricting pose variations. Meanwhile, the textual embedding also affects the visual identity.

Proposed Solution: 
To resolve this conflict, two main ideas are proposed:

1. Contextual embedding orchestration: The visual embedding vector is orthogonalized with respect to the subspace of textual embedding vectors. This eliminates elements in the visual embedding that interfere with the textual embedding, enabling it to guide pose variations more effectively.

2. Self-attention swap: A second diffusion process uses only the visual embedding to retain a clean version of the subject's identity. The self-attention in the main diffusion process is then partially swapped with the attention maps from this second process. This allows injecting the subject's identity into appropriate regions when generating images.


Main Contributions:
- Identifying inherent conflicts between visual and textual embeddings in zero-shot customization as the cause of pose bias and identity loss
- Proposing contextual embedding orchestration to align the visual embedding to mitigate interference 
- Introducing self-attention swap to retain the subject's identity while varying pose
- Demonstrating improved capability for pose variations without compromising identity or performance in other scenarios

The solutions are model-agnostic and require no additional tuning. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments verify their ability to enable more diverse and lively image generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes methods called contextual embedding orchestration and self-attention swap to resolve pose bias and identity loss issues in zero-shot text-to-image customization by alleviating interference between visual and textual embeddings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It unveils the problems of pose bias and identity loss in zero-shot text-to-image customization methods. Specifically, it finds that there is a conflict between the visual embedding from the input image and the textual embedding from the text prompt, which leads to these problems. 

2) It proposes two methods to alleviate this conflict - "contextual embedding orchestration" which orthogonalizes the visual embedding with respect to the textual embedding to reduce interference, and "self-attention swap" which retains clean identity information from a visual-only embedding process.

3) The proposed methods are demonstrated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to enable more diverse and pose-variant image generation while maintaining identity, without requiring additional tuning. The key insight is managing the relationship between visual and textual embeddings in zero-shot customization.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying the conflict between visual and textual embeddings in zero-shot text-to-image customization as the cause of pose bias and identity loss, and proposing orchestration and attention swap methods to address this. The key insight is on better integrating the visual and textual modalities.

The paper proposes methods called "contextual embedding orchestration" and "self-attention swap" to address problems that arise in zero-shot customization of T2I models, specifically pose bias and identity loss stemming from interference between the visual and textual embeddings. The key goals are enabling more diverse and pose-variant subject-driven image generation while maintaining subject identity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes "contextual embedding orchestration" to resolve the interference between the visual and textual embeddings. What is the key idea behind orchestrating the embeddings? How does orthogonalizing the visual embedding help resolve this interference?

2. The paper observes "pose bias" and "identity loss" as two key problems with existing zero-shot customization methods. How does the proposed orchestration method aim to alleviate these two issues? What causes these problems in the first place? 

3. When computing the orthogonal visual embedding in Equation 1, why are the text tokens corresponding to the pseudo-word and its class name excluded? What role do these tokens play in influencing the generated image?

4. The paper adopts a second denoising process guided only by the visual embedding. What is the motivation behind this? Why does the visual-only embedding help retain the subject's identity better?

5. Explain the key idea behind the proposed "self-attention swap" method. How does it allow modifying the pose while preserving the subject's identity? What role does the cross-attention map play here?

6. Why is the self-attention swap restricted only to the latent pixels corresponding to the subject? How is the subject mask computed for this purpose? 

7. The paper demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative experiments on two datasets. What are the key strengths and limitations of these datasets for evaluating pose variation capabilities?

8. The paper reports metrics using subject segmentation masks. Why is this useful, especially for the Deformable Subject dataset? How does it give better insight compared to normal image metrics?

9. What do the user study results indicate about the proposed method's ability to balance text alignment and identity preservation? What conclusions can you draw from the preferences shown?

10. The ablation study explores orthogonalizing visual embedding w.r.t. various text embeddings. What does this reveal about the need to consider text prompt while orchestrating? How is explicitly handling prompt text embedding important?
