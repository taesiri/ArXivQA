# [SeiT: Storage-Efficient Vision Training with Tokens Using 1% of Pixel   Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11114)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we train high-performing vision classifiers at scale while using only a small fraction of the storage required for raw image pixels? 

The key hypothesis is that by representing images as discrete tokens rather than continuous pixel values, it is possible to train classifiers using orders of magnitude less storage without significantly sacrificing accuracy. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Storage-Efficient Vision Training (SeiT), which represents images using a small number of tokens extracted by a pre-trained visual tokenizer. The core ideas are:

- Images can be compressed to sequences of discrete tokens rather than raw pixels, requiring much less storage.

- Tokenizers can be pre-trained to extract semantically meaningful tokens from images.

- Classifiers like Vision Transformers can be trained on token sequences with minimal modifications.

- Simple token-based augmentations like Token-EDA and Embed-Noise can replace pixel-level augmentations.

The central hypothesis is that by training on token sequences, the classifiers will focus less on imperceptible image details and more on semantically relevant features, allowing accurate models using only 1% of pixel storage.

The experiments on ImageNet and other datasets aim to validate this hypothesis, showing SeiT can match or exceed the accuracy of other storage reduction methods using far less storage. The effectiveness for pre-training and continual learning also supports the usefulness of the token-based training paradigm.

In summary, the main research question is how to achieve high accuracy in vision models while drastically reducing the storage needed for training data through tokenization. The paper proposes and validates the SeiT method as an effective approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a storage-efficient vision training method called SeiT that uses tokenized images rather than raw pixels. The key ideas are:

- Tokenizing images using a pre-trained visual tokenizer like VQGAN or ViT-VQGAN. This allows compressing images to a sequence of discrete tokens that requires much less storage than pixels.

- Proposing token-level augmentations like Token-EDA, Token-RRC, Token-CutMix, and Embedding Noise to enable effective training on tokens.

- Introducing a Stem-Adapter module to allow using the tokenized images as input to ViT models with minimal modification.

- Achieving significantly higher accuracy than other storage reduction methods like sampling and JPEG compression when using only 1% of the original ImageNet pixel storage.

- Showing SeiT can be used for efficient pre-training on large datasets like ImageNet-21k and also works well for continual learning.

The main advantage is that by training on discrete tokens rather than continuous pixel values, SeiT removes imperceptible image details that are unnecessary for recognition tasks. This allows drastically reducing the storage for large datasets while maintaining good accuracy. The experiments demonstrate SeiT outperforms other approaches substantially in very low storage regimes.

In summary, the core contribution is developing an efficient training framework that relies only on compact token representations rather than pixel images, enabling scaling up vision models with limited storage infrastructure. The simple but effective techniques make this possible with minimal changes to standard ViT training procedures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a storage-efficient vision training method called SeiT that uses discrete tokens extracted by a pre-trained tokenizer instead of raw image pixels, achieving comparable accuracy to pixel-based methods while using only 1% of the storage space.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces SeiT, a method for storage-efficient vision training using tokens instead of raw pixel images. Here are some key points on how it compares to other related works:

- The main innovation is using a frozen pretrained tokenizer like VQGAN to convert images to discrete tokens before training computer vision models. This allows over 100x compression in storage compared to JPEG images while still achieving good accuracy.

- Previous works on efficient training tried reducing the dataset via importance sampling or synthesizing condensed images. However, SeiT keeps the full dataset and gets efficiency through tokenization. It outperforms sampling and image synthesis methods.

- Another approach is to directly compress images with learned compression models. But those target reconstructing pixels perfectly rather than extracting features useful for vision models. SeiT's tokenizer is directly tailored for training performant classifiers. 

- Using pretrained frozen features is common, but prior works used things like HOG or CNN features. A limitation was needing specialized modules to handle these features. A contribution of SeiT is showing tokens can train transformers like ViT with minimal modification.

- For augmentation, SeiT introduces simple but effective operations like token EDA, token CutMix, and adding embedding noise. This is compared to pixel-level augs like RandAugment that aren't applicable to tokens.

- SeiT achieves strong results on ImageNet classification and also shows benefits for efficient pretraining and continual learning. The tokenization approach seems widely applicable.

In summary, SeiT introduces an effective tokenization-based framework for storage-efficient computer vision training. It outperforms other compression and sampling methods. A key innovation is showing tokens can train models like ViT with minimal changes. The tokenization idea could enable training vision models at much larger scales.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Investigating more advanced adversarial attack methods against SeiT beyond the straight-through estimator. The authors note that SeiT seems robust to the gradient-based attacks they tested, but this could be due to obfuscated gradients. Developing more effective attacks tailored for discrete token inputs could reveal vulnerabilities. 

- Exploring how to apply pixel-level distortion augmentations at the token level. The authors found that strong pixel-level augmentations are key for robustness against corruptions and distribution shifts. Developing equivalent token-level distortions could further improve SeiT's robustness.

- Improving the encoding power and robustness of the tokenizer. The authors note the tokenizer is a potential vulnerability, so developing more robust tokenizers could improve performance.

- Scaling up pre-training with tokens on larger datasets. The authors show promising results pre-training on ImageNet-21k tokens, but larger datasets could further improve transfer learning performance.

- Applying SeiT to other domains like video, point clouds, etc. The authors focus on images, but tokenization could enable efficient training in other modalities.

- Exploring other tokenization approaches beyond VQ-VAE. While VQGAN worked well, other methods of discretizing continuous data could be effective.

- Reducing the gap between token-based and pixel-based performance. There is still a gap compared to training on full pixels, so closing this gap further is an important direction.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving robustness, scaling up token pre-training, applying tokenization to new domains and modalities, and continuing to close the performance gap to pixel-based training. The tokenization approach shows promise, but there are still many open research questions to address.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes SeiT (Storage-Efficient Vision Training), a method to significantly compress the storage required for image datasets used to train vision models, while maintaining high accuracy. SeiT tokenizes images using a pre-trained visual tokenizer which extracts a small set of discrete tokens per image. This allows each image to be stored using only around 1kB, compared to 100kB+ for normal JPEG images. To enable training vision transformers on this compact tokenized data, the paper introduces simple token-specific augmentations like Token-EDA and Emb-Noise, as well as a Stem-Adapter module. Experiments on ImageNet show SeiT can achieve 74% accuracy using only 1% of the original image storage size. SeiT also enables more efficient large-scale pre-training and continual learning compared to pixel-based training. The key advantage is SeiT removes imperceptible image details unimportant for recognition, while retaining visual information useful for training performant classifiers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a storage-efficient vision training method called SeiT that relies on tokens rather than pixels to significantly reduce image storage requirements. SeiT converts images to sequences of discrete tokens using a pre-trained vision tokenizer like ViT-VQGAN. This allows each image to be represented by just 1024 tokens rather than millions of pixels, reducing storage needs to less than 1% of the original JPEG images. The tokenized images can then be trained on using vision transformer models like ViT with only minimal modifications - a new stem adapter module is used to transform the tokens into the expected tensor shape for the model. Simple token-based data augmentations like token EDA, embedding noise, and token cutmix are also proposed since image augmentations don't apply directly. 

Experiments on ImageNet classification demonstrate SeiT's effectiveness - it achieves 74% accuracy using just 1.4GB of storage for the tokenized dataset versus 140GB for the original images. SeiT also shows promise for large-scale pre-training and continual learning scenarios where storage reduction is beneficial. For example, pre-training on tokenized ImageNet-21k then fine-tuning on ImageNet-1k pixels achieves 82.8% accuracy using just 11% more storage than training on ImageNet-1k pixels alone. Overall, SeiT provides an efficient way to train vision models using far less image data storage than normal pixel-based training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a storage-efficient vision training method called SeiT that uses tokens rather than raw pixels to represent images. It tokenizes images using a pre-trained visual tokenizer like ViT-VQGAN, converting each image to a 32x32 sequence of discrete tokens. This compact token representation allows it to train vision models using only 1% of the storage required for pixels. To enable training transformers like ViT on tokens, it proposes token-specific augmentations like Token-EDA, Token-RRC, Token-CutMix, and Emb-Noise. It also introduces a simple Stem-Adapter module to convert the 32x32 tokens into a form compatible with ViT models. By training ViT models on tokenized ImageNet with these adaptations, SeiT is able to achieve 74.0% ImageNet accuracy using only 1.36GB of storage, compared to 140GB for pixels. It demonstrates the effectiveness of token-based training for ImageNet classification, storage-efficient pre-training, and continual learning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of large storage requirements for training vision models on large-scale image datasets. Some key points:

- Large-scale image datasets require massive storage, which is a bottleneck for scaling up vision models. For example, ImageNet-21k with 11M images needs 1.4TB, much larger than language datasets like GPT-3 with 570GB for 410B tokens.

- Images contain lots of imperceptible details that may be unnecessary for training vision classifiers. Models may attend too much to these details rather than true properties of objects. 

- Prior storage-efficient methods like importance sampling or image synthesis show significant performance drops or don't scale to large datasets. Adjusting image resolution/JPEG compression works better but is still limited.

- The paper proposes a storage-efficient training strategy using discrete tokens rather than raw pixels. They extract 1024 tokens per image using a pre-trained tokenizer like ViT-VQGAN, requiring only 1.36GB for ImageNet (~1% of pixels).

- They introduce token augmentations and a Stem-Adapter module to enable training vision transformers on tokens with minimal modifications vs pixel-based methods.

- Experiments show their method significantly outperforms other storage-efficient approaches. With 1% of ImageNet storage, they achieve 74% accuracy on ImageNet-1k vs 59-69% for other methods.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of massive storage needs for image datasets, proposing a highly storage-efficient token-based training strategy that maintains accuracy much better than other methods. The key insight is that models don't need all pixel details, just discriminative token representations.
