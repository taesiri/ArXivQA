# [Improving Diffusion-Based Generative Models via Approximated Optimal   Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models can generate high-quality images but often require many sampling steps, leading to inefficiency. This is due to high curvature in the models' ODE trajectories.
- Previous work has used optimal transport to straighten trajectories in other generative models, but this is computationally prohibitive for diffusion models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose "Approximated Optimal Transport" (AOT), a novel training technique to approximate and integrate optimal transport into diffusion models. 
- During training, AOT selects noise samples that have the lowest cost (L2 distance) to the real image batch rather than random noise. This is framed as an assignment problem and solved efficiently with the Hungarian algorithm.
- AOT reduces the information entropy/uncertainty that the model has to resolve, allowing it to learn trajectories with lower curvature.

Main Contributions:
- AOT technique to approximate optimal transport in diffusion model training, reducing ODE trajectory curvature.
- Achieves state-of-the-art image quality on CIFAR-10 with fewer sampling steps. Unconditional FID 1.88 with 27 steps, conditional FID 1.73 with 29 steps.
- Further improvements when combining with Discriminator Guidance, also trained using AOT. New unconditional SOTA FID 1.68, conditional SOTA FID 1.58.
- Analysis shows AOT models robust to larger sampling strides without decline in image quality.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient way to integrate ideas from optimal transport into diffusion model training. This straightens the models' internal representations, allowing very high-quality image generation with fewer sampling steps.
