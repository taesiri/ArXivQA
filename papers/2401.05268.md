# [AUTOACT: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch via Self-Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing language agent systems rely on costly, non-reproducible data and struggle to compel a single model to perform multiple functions well. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data or trajectories from closed-source models like GPT-4.

- It starts with a Meta-Agent that augments a small dataset via self-instruction. 

- Then the Meta-Agent conducts "self-planning" where it automatically selects tools, synthesizes planning trajectories, and differentiates into sub-agents using the trajectories:
    - Plan-Agent: Decomposes tasks and determines which tool to invoke
    - Tool-Agent: Decides parameters for tool invocation 
    - Reflect-Agent: Engages in reflection using historical trajectories

- These specialized sub-agents then perform collaborative group planning to complete tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large datasets or closed-source models
- Employs a division-of-labor strategy to differentiate sub-agents to reduce pressure on any single agent
- Achieves better performance compared to strong baselines like FireAct and GPT-3.5-Turbo agent
- Analysis shows effectiveness of division-of-labor strategy and high quality of self-synthesized trajectories

In summary, the key ideas are automatic agent learning from scratch via self-planning, without reliance on external datasets/models, along with an appropriate division of labor among sub-agents. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on QA tasks using this strategy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data or trajectories from closed-source models, instead using self-planning and a division-of-labor strategy among differentiated sub-agents to achieve comparable performance to strong baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data or synthetic trajectories from closed-source models. 

2. It introduces a "division-of-labor" strategy where the Meta-Agent differentiates into sub-agents with distinct functionalities (Plan-Agent, Tool-Agent, Reflect-Agent) to perform collaborative planning.

3. It demonstrates through experiments that AutoAct yields better or comparable performance to strong baselines on complex question answering tasks, using only a tool library and limited task data examples provided by the user. The performance is shown to be on par with even the GPT-3.5-Turbo agent in some cases.

4. Analysis shows the effectiveness of the appropriate "division-of-labor" strategy and that the quality of self-synthesized trajectories by AutoAct significantly outperforms other methods.

In summary, the key contribution is an automatic and data-efficient agent learning framework that does not rely on closed-source models and achieves strong performance through an effective strategy of dividing planning labor across specialized sub-agents.
