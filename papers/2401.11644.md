# [Friends Across Time: Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Transformer for   Surgical Phase Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11644)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Surgical phase recognition, which involves automatically detecting phases/steps in surgery videos, is an important technology for modern operating rooms and surgical video platforms. Current state-of-the-art methods use spatial and temporal modeling but have limitations in capturing relations between frames and segments at different temporal scales. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose two transformer-based models - Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Transformer (MS-AST) for offline phase recognition and Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Causal Transformer (MS-ASCT) for online/real-time recognition. The key ideas are:

1) Multi-scale temporal self-attention and cross-attention to capture relations between frames and segments across different temporal scales. This enhances capture of both fast and slow actions in videos.

2) Causal mechanisms in MS-ASCT to ensure no leakage of future information for real-time recognition.

3) Flexibility to work with different spatial feature extractors like ResNet50 and EfficientNetV2.

Main Contributions:

1) MS-AST and MS-ASCT achieve new state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset for offline (96.15%) and online (95.26%) phase recognition, advancing progress in this area.

2) The models achieve state-of-the-art performance on non-medical datasets (GTEA, 50Salads) as well, demonstrating wide applicability.

3) Thorough experiments comparing 3 temporal scales, comparing MS-AST with single-scale methods, visualization of phase predictions, and confusion matrix analysis to provide insights.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through new state-of-the-art transformer models for surgical phase recognition that capture multi-scale temporal relationships and demonstrates flexibility and wider applicability beyond medical scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Transformer and its causal version for surgical phase recognition which achieve state-of-the-art results by modeling temporal information across frames and segments at different scales.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Transformer (MS-AST) for offline surgical phase recognition and Multi-Scale Action Segmentation Causal Transformer (MS-ASCT) for online surgical phase recognition. These methods utilize multiple temporal scales to model both frame-level and segment-level information.

2) Achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset for both online and offline surgical phase recognition. The proposed MS-AST and MS-ASCT outperform previous methods by 2-3% in various metrics.  

3) Demonstrating the wider applicability of the proposed approach by evaluating MS-AST on non-medical datasets (50Salads and GTEA) and achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the multi-scale transformer models (MS-AST and MS-ASCT) for surgical phase recognition and showing through experiments that they advance the state-of-the-art on medical and non-medical video datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using multi-scale temporal self-attention and multi-scale temporal cross-attention to capture relations between frames and segments at different temporal scales. Can you explain in detail how this multi-scale attention mechanism works and how it helps capture both short and long range dependencies in the videos?

2. The paper evaluates the method on both online and offline surgical phase recognition tasks. What modifications were made to the proposed MS-AST model to make it causal for online phase recognition? Explain the MS-ASCT model in detail. 

3. The multi-scale attention uses varied dilated convolution kernel sizes and sliding window sizes. What were the exact kernel sizes and corresponding window sizes used? What was the intuition behind selecting these specific kernel sizes?

4. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset using two different feature extraction backbones - ResNet50 and EfficientNetV2. Analyze the results with both backbones and explain why EfficientNet performs better.

5. Take a deeper look at the confusion matrix in Figure 5. Which surgical phases does the model tend to confuse more? Provide possible reasons for these errors based on analysis of the data, model architecture and the nature of those surgical phases.  

6. For online phase recognition, the MS-ASCT model outperforms prior state-of-the-art by a good margin across all metrics. Dig deeper into the segmental edit scores and F1 scores at different overlaps. What inferences can you draw about how the multi-scale modeling helps?

7. The visualizations in Figure 4 show fewer over-segmentation errors compared to the baseline ASFormer model. Analyze these qualitative results and explain how the multi-scale attention provides smoother predictions over time.

8. For offline recognition, analyze why the MS-AST with 3 decoders performs much better than methods relying on GRU/LSTM for temporal modeling. What are the benefits of the transformer architecture here?

9. The robustness of the method is proved by state-of-the-art results on 50Salads and GTEA datasets. Compare performance vs prior works on these datasets. Does multi-scale modeling help more or less for these domains compared to surgical videos?

10. The paper focuses only on surgical phase recognition. What are other potential applications in healthcare or other domains where this multi-scale action segmentation transformer could be useful? Explain your reasoning.
