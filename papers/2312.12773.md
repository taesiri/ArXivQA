# [Segmenting Messy Text: Detecting Boundaries in Text Derived from   Historical Newspaper Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12773)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenging problem of segmenting messy text derived from historical newspaper images into coherent segments, using the example of marriage announcements. Key challenges include:

- Text is derived from low-quality images via OCR, containing errors
- Text lacks narrative structure (e.g. not structured into sentences)  
- Adjacent segments are lexically/semantically similar (announcements of different couples)
- Hierarchical structure with headers applying to multiple segments

Existing segmentation methods rely on clean text and topic shifts between segments, hence perform poorly.

Solution:
The paper presents a neural sequence tagging model to jointly segment text and categorize segments (as marriage announcements). Key aspects include:

- Token-level segmentation as sentence splitting is unreliable
- Incorporates spatial features since text coordinates are available  
- Uses contextual ELMo embeddings fine-tuned on in-domain OCR text
- BIO tagging scheme to handle hierarchy (\texttt{B-Marriage}, \texttt{I-Marriage}, \texttt{O} tags)

The model encodes each token using character embeddings, GloVe embeddings, fine-tuned ELMo embeddings, casing features and spatial features. These token representations are fed into a BiLSTM-CRF model to predict BIO tags.

Contributions:

- Novel model for segmenting messy, non-narrative text derived from images 
- Token-level segmentation more reliable than sentence splitting
- Incorporates spatial layout and fine-tuned contextual embeddings
- Joint segmentation and categorization with BIO tagging scheme
- Significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on marriage announcement task

The model could be extended to handle multiple segment types and applied to other sources of noisy text like transcripts or handwritten documents.
