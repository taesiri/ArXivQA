# [CFRet-DVQA: Coarse-to-Fine Retrieval and Efficient Tuning for Document   Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00816)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Existing methods for document visual question answering (DVQA) are limited to single-page documents and cannot handle long or multi-page documents effectively. They also struggle with answer positioning and have limited context lengths due to token limitations. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new framework called CFRet-DVQA which has two key components:

1) Coarse-to-Fine Retrieval: A multi-stage approach to accurately retrieve the most relevant context from long documents based on the question. It first does coarse retrieval of large chunks of text, then fine-grained retrieval of smaller chunks within those, and finally reranking and selection using a large language model.

2) Efficient Tuning: The paper finetunes a large language model (LLama) using a combination of techniques like LoRA, prefix tuning and bias tuning which unlocks only a small subset of the model's parameters. This allows efficient adaptation to the style of the fine-tuning data.

Together this allows handling multi-page documents effectively while generating high quality and in-style answers.

Main Contributions:

- A new simple but highly effective CFRet-DVQA framework for both single and multi-page DVQA. 

- A new coarse-to-fine retrieval approach to accurately pinpoint relevant context from long documents.

- An efficient finetuning approach that adapts LLMs using only 22M trainable parameters.

- State-of-the-art or competitive performance on 5 benchmark DVQA datasets encompassing diverse fields and both single and multi-page documents.
