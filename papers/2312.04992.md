 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions implementing 34 state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in PFLlib. Could you elaborate on the process and challenges of implementing such a wide variety of algorithms? What compromises or simplifying assumptions, if any, were made during the implementations?

2. One of the key features of PFLlib seems to be its easy extendability to add new algorithms, scenarios and datasets. Could you walk through the steps needed to add a new personalized federated learning algorithm to PFLlib? What core APIs and base code does one need to leverage?

3. The paper talks about using differential privacy as one of the privacy-preserving techniques. How exactly is differential privacy integrated in PFLlib? Are all or only select algorithms differentially private? What privacy budgets were used? 

4. For the Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG) attack implemented, what parameters were used? How sensitive is the attack to these parameters? Were any defenses against DLG attacks evaluated as well?

5. In Table 1, the algorithms are categorized into groups like meta-learning-based, regularization-based etc. Could you expand on the key distinguishing characteristics and techniques used by algorithms in each group? How do they differ fundamentally?

6. For the personalized federated learning algorithms evaluated in Table 2, could you contrast and compare the tradeoffs between optimization for personalization vs global model performance? How does this tradeoff vary across datasets and modalities?

7. What additional heterogeneity parameters beyond feature/label distributions were explored for generating the custom scenarios? Would factors like system heterogeneity across clients be considered in the future?

8. The paper mentions usage for sensor signal datasets as one of the scenarios. What unique challenges exist in applying federated learning for IoT and wearables compared to more traditional CV/NLP tasks?

9. What additional evaluation metrics beyond test accuracy were considered for benchmarking? Would metrics capturing communication costs, fairness etc. be relevant dimensions for comparison?

10. How does PFLlib aim handle scaling challenges as the number of clients keeps increasing? At what point is cross-silo federated learning or hierarchical architectures needed?
