# [Cyclic pursuit formation control for arbitrary desired shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Formation control in multi-agent systems is an important task where agents coordinate to form various shapes while preserving the ensemble integrity. 
- Previous cyclic pursuit methods have been limited to only achieving simple formations like circles, ellipses, and figure-eights. 
- This paper aims to develop a method based on cyclic pursuit that can enable agents to form a wider range of arbitrary shapes beyond these basic formations.

Method:
- Two problem settings are addressed with different assumptions on information available to agents:
   1) Agents share coordinate system 
   2) Agents lack shared coordinate system
- In the first setting, each agent's movement has two vector components:
      - v_i1: Vector for individually tracing the shape  
      - v_i2: Vector for coordinating movements with predecessors
- In the second setting without shared coordinates: 
     - Additional rotations are introduced to align agents' orientations 
     - Probability of executing rotations is dynamically adjusted based on formation achievement

Results:  
- Simulations demonstrate progressive tracing of 5 different random shapes by agents
- Quantitative metric based on Frechet distance between agent trajectories and desired shape shows accuracy
- Achievement-decrease method reduces rotation probability on formation achievement, preventing collapses
- Effectiveness shown even for more complex shapes with angles and intersections

Contributions:
- Proposes novel cyclic pursuit based method to achieve arbitrary shapes beyond limitations of previous methods
- Handles two distinct problem settings based on information availability 
- Showcases versatility through simulations on random and complex shapes
- Provides insights into intricate dynamics to advance future cyclic pursuit based formation control
