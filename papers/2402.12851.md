# [MoELoRA: Contrastive Learning Guided Mixture of Experts on   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 on downstream tasks requires updating billions of parameters, which demands significant computational resources. 
- Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods using global parameters (like LoRA) face challenges in flexibly combining different computational modules for complex downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel PEFT method called MoELoRA which considers LoRA as a Mixture of Experts (MoE). 
- Leverages modeling capabilities of multiple LoRA experts to handle complex data domains.
- Addresses MoE's random routing issue by using contrastive learning to encourage experts to learn distinct features.

Key Contributions:
- Propose MoELoRA which combines concept of MoE and LoRA to achieve superior performance over LoRA with the same number of parameters.
- Introduce contrastive learning among experts to mitigate random routing issue and encourage experts to capture diverse features.
- Evaluate on 11 datasets for math and commonsense reasoning tasks. MoELoRA outperforms LoRA in all tasks, averaging 4.2% higher on math tasks.
- Remains competitive compared to 175B parameter GPT-3.5 model on several benchmarks.
- Ablation studies validate effectiveness of contrastive loss in improving performance.

In summary, the paper proposes MoELoRA, a novel PEFT technique that fuses MoE and LoRA, and uses contrastive learning to address routing issues. Evaluations demonstrate consistent and significant gains over LoRA baseline with the same parameter budget.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method called MoELoRA, which considers LoRA as Mixture of Experts (MoE) and leverages the modeling capabilities of multiple experts for better adaptation to downstream tasks.

2. Addressing the random routing issue in using MoE for LoRA fusion by introducing contrastive learning to encourage experts to learn distinct features. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on 11 datasets for math reasoning and common-sense reasoning tasks, demonstrating that MoELoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across all tasks. In math reasoning, MoELoRA averaged 4.2% higher performance than LoRA, and in common-sense reasoning, it averaged 1.0% higher than LoRA.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the MoELoRA method for more flexible and effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, and showing its superior performance over LoRA via comprehensive experiments.
