# [MoELoRA: Contrastive Learning Guided Mixture of Experts on   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 on downstream tasks requires updating billions of parameters, which demands significant computational resources. 
- Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods using global parameters (like LoRA) face challenges in flexibly combining different computational modules for complex downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel PEFT method called MoELoRA which considers LoRA as a Mixture of Experts (MoE). 
- Leverages modeling capabilities of multiple LoRA experts to handle complex data domains.
- Addresses MoE's random routing issue by using contrastive learning to encourage experts to learn distinct features.

Key Contributions:
- Propose MoELoRA which combines concept of MoE and LoRA to achieve superior performance over LoRA with the same number of parameters.
- Introduce contrastive learning among experts to mitigate random routing issue and encourage experts to capture diverse features.
- Evaluate on 11 datasets for math and commonsense reasoning tasks. MoELoRA outperforms LoRA in all tasks, averaging 4.2% higher on math tasks.
- Remains competitive compared to 175B parameter GPT-3.5 model on several benchmarks.
- Ablation studies validate effectiveness of contrastive loss in improving performance.

In summary, the paper proposes MoELoRA, a novel PEFT technique that fuses MoE and LoRA, and uses contrastive learning to address routing issues. Evaluations demonstrate consistent and significant gains over LoRA baseline with the same parameter budget.
