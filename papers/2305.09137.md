# [Pre-Training to Learn in Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09137)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we enhance language models' ability to perform in-context learning, while maintaining their generalization across diverse tasks? The key hypothesis is that pre-training language models on a large corpus of text containing diverse "intrinsic tasks" will improve their in-context learning abilities. Specifically:- Many paragraphs in large text corpora contain implicit tasks that models could learn from. - By retrieving similar paragraphs that contain the same intrinsic tasks and concatenating them into pre-training examples, models can learn to perform these diverse tasks in context.- Pre-training on such a corpus will teach models to infer and solve tasks from contexts, improving in-context learning, while maintaining generalization due to the diversity and lack of bias in the pre-training data.So in summary, the central research question is how to improve in-context learning through pre-training, and the hypothesis is that constructing pre-training data containing diverse intrinsic tasks will achieve this goal. The experiments then evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new pre-training method called PICL (Pre-training for In-Context Learning) to enhance language models' ability to perform in-context learning. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Observing that the pre-training corpus contains many "intrinsic tasks" in natural text paragraphs that can be exploited to improve in-context learning. - Proposing a framework to gather paragraphs with the same intrinsic tasks from the corpus and concatenate them as demonstrations. This constructs meta-training data for in-context learning while maintaining diversity and minimizing bias.- Pre-training the language model on the constructed data with a language modeling objective, which teaches the model to infer and perform various intrinsic tasks conditioning on previous context.- Showing through experiments that PICL improves in-context learning ability and outperforms larger models on text classification and instruction following benchmarks.- Analyzing different model variations and data construction factors to provide insights into how to improve in-context learning.In summary, the key contribution is using intrinsic tasks in the pre-training corpus itself to enhance in-context learning in a way that maintains task generalization, rather than relying on external datasets. The proposed PICL framework and analysis shed light on how to better exploit and improve the in-context learning capacity of large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes PICL, a method to enhance large language models' ability to perform tasks by learning from context, by pre-training them on a corpus of paragraphs gathered using a retriever to share the same implicit tasks.
