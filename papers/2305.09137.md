# [Pre-Training to Learn in Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09137)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we enhance language models' ability to perform in-context learning, while maintaining their generalization across diverse tasks? The key hypothesis is that pre-training language models on a large corpus of text containing diverse "intrinsic tasks" will improve their in-context learning abilities. Specifically:- Many paragraphs in large text corpora contain implicit tasks that models could learn from. - By retrieving similar paragraphs that contain the same intrinsic tasks and concatenating them into pre-training examples, models can learn to perform these diverse tasks in context.- Pre-training on such a corpus will teach models to infer and solve tasks from contexts, improving in-context learning, while maintaining generalization due to the diversity and lack of bias in the pre-training data.So in summary, the central research question is how to improve in-context learning through pre-training, and the hypothesis is that constructing pre-training data containing diverse intrinsic tasks will achieve this goal. The experiments then evaluate this hypothesis.
