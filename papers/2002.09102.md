# Estimation-Action-Reflection: Towards Deep Interaction Between   Conversational and Recommender Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively build a conversational recommender system (CRS) that can interact with users through natural language conversations to provide good recommendations. The key hypothesis is that the key to building an effective CRS lies in properly handling the interaction between the conversational system (CS) component and the recommender system (RS) component. In particular, the paper identifies three key problems in this interaction:1) What attributes to ask about - The CRS needs to strategically choose which item attributes to ask the user about in order to elicit useful preferences.2) When to recommend items - The CRS needs to determine the right time to switch from asking questions to making item recommendations, based on its confidence in estimating the user's preferences. 3) How to adapt to user feedback - The CRS needs to update its recommendation and conversation strategies based on whether the user accepts or rejects its questions and recommendations. The central hypothesis is that by properly addressing these three problems through close collaboration between the CS and RS components, an effective multi-round conversational recommender can be built that provides accurate recommendations with fewer conversation turns. The proposed EAR (Estimation-Action-Reflection) framework aims to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework for conversational recommender systems called Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR). The key ideas are:- It considers a multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, where the system interacts with the user through multiple rounds of questions and recommendations until a satisfactory item is found. This is more realistic than prior work that only allows single-round conversations.- It emphasizes the importance of interaction between the conversational component (CC) and recommender component (RC) of the system. Proper collaboration between CC and RC is key to asking good questions, determining when to recommend, and adapting to user feedback. - It proposes the three-stage EAR framework to enable this collaboration:  - Estimation stage: Trains models to estimate user preferences on items and attributes  - Action stage: Learns a policy to decide when to ask vs recommend based on estimation and history  - Reflection stage: Updates recommender model when recommendations are rejected- Each stage has novel designs to account for the interaction between CC and RC. For example, the Estimation stage uses multi-task learning to jointly predict items and attributes. The Action stage encodes signals from both CC and RC into its state vector.  - Experiments on two datasets demonstrate EAR's improvements over prior conversational recommendation methods in terms of success rate and fewer conversation turns.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the EAR framework and various techniques to enable tighter collaboration between the conversational and recommendation components, in order to build an effective conversational recommender system. This addresses limitations of prior work in this emerging area.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new conversational recommender system framework called EAR (Estimation-Action-Reflection) which dynamically interacts with users through conversation to obtain real-time feedback on user preferences and make better recommendations.
