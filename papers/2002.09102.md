# [Estimation-Action-Reflection: Towards Deep Interaction Between   Conversational and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09102)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively build a conversational recommender system (CRS) that can interact with users through natural language conversations to provide good recommendations. 

The key hypothesis is that the key to building an effective CRS lies in properly handling the interaction between the conversational system (CS) component and the recommender system (RS) component. In particular, the paper identifies three key problems in this interaction:

1) What attributes to ask about - The CRS needs to strategically choose which item attributes to ask the user about in order to elicit useful preferences.

2) When to recommend items - The CRS needs to determine the right time to switch from asking questions to making item recommendations, based on its confidence in estimating the user's preferences. 

3) How to adapt to user feedback - The CRS needs to update its recommendation and conversation strategies based on whether the user accepts or rejects its questions and recommendations. 

The central hypothesis is that by properly addressing these three problems through close collaboration between the CS and RS components, an effective multi-round conversational recommender can be built that provides accurate recommendations with fewer conversation turns. The proposed EAR (Estimation-Action-Reflection) framework aims to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework for conversational recommender systems called Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR). The key ideas are:

- It considers a multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, where the system interacts with the user through multiple rounds of questions and recommendations until a satisfactory item is found. This is more realistic than prior work that only allows single-round conversations.

- It emphasizes the importance of interaction between the conversational component (CC) and recommender component (RC) of the system. Proper collaboration between CC and RC is key to asking good questions, determining when to recommend, and adapting to user feedback. 

- It proposes the three-stage EAR framework to enable this collaboration:
  - Estimation stage: Trains models to estimate user preferences on items and attributes
  - Action stage: Learns a policy to decide when to ask vs recommend based on estimation and history
  - Reflection stage: Updates recommender model when recommendations are rejected

- Each stage has novel designs to account for the interaction between CC and RC. For example, the Estimation stage uses multi-task learning to jointly predict items and attributes. The Action stage encodes signals from both CC and RC into its state vector.
  
- Experiments on two datasets demonstrate EAR's improvements over prior conversational recommendation methods in terms of success rate and fewer conversation turns.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the EAR framework and various techniques to enable tighter collaboration between the conversational and recommendation components, in order to build an effective conversational recommender system. This addresses limitations of prior work in this emerging area.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new conversational recommender system framework called EAR (Estimation-Action-Reflection) which dynamically interacts with users through conversation to obtain real-time feedback on user preferences and make better recommendations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new conversational recommender system framework called Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR). Here are some key points on how it compares to other work in conversational recommendation:

- Most prior work focuses on simpler settings like single-round recommendation, where the system only makes one recommendation then stops. This paper considers a more realistic multi-round scenario where the system alternates between asking questions and making recommendations over multiple turns.

- The paper argues that the key challenge in multi-round conversational recommendation is properly handling the interaction between the conversational component (CC) and recommender component (RC). It proposes EAR as a unified framework to address three key problems: what to ask, when to recommend, and how to adapt. 

- The EAR framework emphasizes close collaboration between the CC and RC at each stage. For example, the CC leverages outputs from the RC like predicted item/attribute preferences to decide actions. The RC also adapts based on feedback from the CC.

- Many existing methods treat the CC and RC more separately. For example, the CRM method feeds CC outputs to the RC but lacks a sophisticated state representation to support decision making.

- The paper validates EAR on two real-world datasets using both binary and multi-choice questions. Results show EAR outperforms CRM and other baselines by achieving higher success rate in fewer turns.

- The analysis also provides interesting insights like when the online model updating helps or hurts, which exposes open challenges for the community.

Overall, a key contribution is the new multi-round setting and the proposed tightly integrated CC-RC framework. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over previous conversational recommendation methods. The discussions also help advance understanding of this relatively new research problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporating user feedback more effectively, especially for rejecting/disliking actions. The authors suggest exploring ways to update the policy network when a user rejects a recommended attribute, in order to choose better actions in the future. 

- Achieving a better exploration-exploitation balance, which is a key challenge in traditional interactive recommendation systems. The authors suggest extending their EAR framework to address this balance.

- Deploying the system to interact with real users to gain more insights. The authors acknowledge the limitations of simulated user data and suggest deploying EAR in a real application to interact with actual users. This could provide valuable insights to further improve the system.

- Incorporating natural language processing into the system, including utterance understanding and response generation. The authors suggest this could make the system more robust to errors in language understanding.

- Developing more realistic datasets and interactive environments for conversational recommendation research. The lack of benchmarks in this emerging field is noted as an obstacle. 

- Exploring more effective strategies for online model updating based on user feedback. This is called out as an open challenge for the research community.

In summary, the key directions are: improving the handling of user feedback, achieving better exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, testing the system on real users, incorporating more natural language capabilities, creating better datasets/environments, and developing more effective online updating techniques. Advances in these areas could significantly advance the state of conversational recommender systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new conversational recommender system framework called Estimation--Action--Reflection (EAR) for making recommendations to users through natural language conversations. EAR consists of three stages - Estimation builds predictive models to estimate user preferences on items and attributes, Action decides whether to ask about attributes or recommend items based on the Estimation and conversation history, and Reflection updates the recommendation model when the user rejects recommendations. The authors present two conversation scenarios for binary and enumerated questions, and conduct experiments on the Yelp and LastFM datasets. Results show EAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer conversation turns and more successful recommendations. The framework highlights the importance of interactions between the conversational and recommendation components.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new conversational recommender system framework called Estimation--Action--Reflection (EAR). The framework consists of three key stages. The Estimation stage builds predictive models to estimate user preferences on items and item attributes. It trains a factorization machine using a multi-task learning approach to jointly predict items and attributes that the user will like. The Action stage determines whether to ask the user about an item attribute or recommend items at each turn of the conversation. It uses reinforcement learning to optimize a policy network that chooses these actions based on the Estimation stage predictions and the dialogue history. The Reflection stage adapts the recommender model when the user rejects a list of recommended items. It treats the rejected items as negative examples and retrains the factorization machine model. 

The authors evaluate EAR on two datasets, LastFM and Yelp, comparing it to several baseline methods. The results show EAR can provide successful recommendations in significantly fewer turns than the baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the multi-task training in Estimation and the state encoding in Action. The online model updating in Reflection is shown to be useful for LastFM but not Yelp, providing insights into model adaptation. Overall, the EAR framework and its three-stage approach are shown to be an effective methodology for conversational recommendation. The interactions between the conversational and recommender components are critical for determining good questioning strategies and timing recommendations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new conversational recommender system framework named Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR). The framework consists of three stages. In the Estimation stage, a factorization machine is trained to estimate user preferences on items and item attributes. The model is trained using a multi-task approach to jointly optimize item prediction and attribute prediction. In the Action stage, a policy network is trained with reinforcement learning to determine whether to ask the user about an attribute or recommend items, based on the estimation from the previous stage and the conversation history. The policy aims to maximize successful recommendations in fewer turns. In the Reflection stage, when the user rejects recommended items, those items are treated as negative examples to update the factorization machine model online, in order to improve future recommendations. The three stages work together to achieve effective conversational recommendation through interactions between the conversational and recommendation components.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of how to build an effective conversational recommender system (CRS). The key challenges they identify are:

1) What attributes to ask the user about in order to gather useful preferences and narrow down item candidates.

2) When to switch from asking questions to making item recommendations.

3) How to dynamically update the recommendation model based on user feedback during the conversation. 

The main research question is how to achieve effective interaction between the conversational component (CC) and the recommendation component (RC) of a CRS in order to address these challenges. The CC needs to leverage signals from the RC like estimated user preferences to ask good questions. The RC needs to incorporate user feedback from the CC to update recommendations.

The paper proposes a framework called Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR) to enable this tight interaction between the CC and RC across three stages:

1) Estimation - Build models to estimate user preferences on items and attributes.

2) Action - Learn a policy to decide when to ask vs recommend based on Estimation and history. 

3) Reflection - Update recommender model when recommendations are rejected.

The key contribution is providing a unified framework to address the challenges of building an effective multi-round conversational recommender system through tight CC-RC interaction.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new conversational recommender system framework named Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR) to enable deep interaction between the conversational and recommendation components. EAR has three main stages. First is the Estimation stage, which trains a factorization machine model for estimating user preferences on both items and attributes. This model is trained jointly on item prediction and attribute prediction in a multi-task learning approach. Second is the Action stage, where a policy network learns when to ask about attributes versus recommend items based on the estimation model and dialogue history. The state encoding to represent this information is a key contribution. Third is the Reflection stage which updates the recommendation model online when the user rejects recommendations, treating rejected items as negative instances. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate EAR's ability to make successful recommendations in fewer turns compared to previous conversational recommendation methods. The paper provides useful analysis into the performance gains from different components like multi-task training and state encoding. Overall, this paper makes important contributions in comprehensively studying the deep interaction between conversational and recommendation components under a multi-round setting to build an effective conversational recommender system.
