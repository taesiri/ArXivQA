# [Scattered Mixture-of-Experts Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have become popular for scaling up models, but are challenging to implement efficiently on GPUs. Naive implementations are too slow.
- Existing implementations like Megablocks have limitations:
   - Require copying input embeddings when grouping tokens by expert, increasing memory overhead
   - Use padding to make expert token groups equal size, further increasing memory
   - Opaque sparse matrix format makes extending SMoEs difficult

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ParallelLinear module that performs grouped matrix operations on scattered groups, fusing grouping & linear steps
   - Avoids copies and padding of embeddings
   - Handles various input/output grouped/scattered configurations 
   - Easy to integrate and extend, exposes tensors instead of sparse matrices

- Use ParallelLinear to implement efficient SMoE MLP and Attention layers
   - Configurations reduce copies and reuse memory in backprop
   - Retains scattered order after first layer for Attention - avoids extra group/scatter ops

Contributions:
- ParallelLinear primitive for building various MoE layers without redundancy
- Efficient implementations of SMoE MLP & Attention using ParallelLinear
- Reduces memory footprint by 33-47% compared to Megablocks
- Increases throughput by 24-38% for SMoE MLP over Megablocks
- Relative gains higher for higher module granularity and batched inference
- Worked examples to extend SMoEs to new mixtures like Attention


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces ScatterMoE, an efficient GPU implementation of sparse Mixture-of-Experts layers that reduces memory footprint and improves throughput by fusing grouping and linear transformation operations, enabling easy extension to other expert layer variants.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is an implementation of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) called ScatterMoE that:

1) Minimizes memory footprint compared to existing SMoE implementations by fusing the grouping and linear transformation steps, avoiding extra copies and padding of tensors.

2) Offers higher throughput/speed compared to existing solutions like Megablocks.

3) Is built around a flexible ParallelLinear module that enables easy extension to other Mixture-of-Expert style modules beyond just SMoE MLPs, such as the demonstrated Mixture of Attention.

So in summary, ScatterMoE provides a faster, lower memory, and more extensible implementation of SMoEs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE)
- Megablocks
- ParallelLinear 
- scatter2scatter
- Mixture-of-Attention (MoA)
- grouped General Matrix Multiplications (GeMMs)
- granularity
- throughput
- memory footprint

The paper presents an implementation called ScatterMoE that aims to improve upon existing SMoE implementations like Megablocks in terms of throughput and memory usage. It introduces a core component called ParallelLinear that fuses grouped GeMM and scattered read/write operations. This is used to build SMoE modules like multi-layer perceptrons and attention layers. The paper analyzes the performance of ScatterMoE compared to Megablocks under different conditions and shows improvements in throughput and lower memory footprint, especially for high granularity configurations. It also demonstrates the extensibility of the approach through an implementation of Mixture-of-Attention.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does ParallelLinear operation allow for both forward and backward passes of the SMoE MLP without explicit grouping operations? What are the different input/output configurations it supports?

2. Explain the memory footprint savings achieved by ParallelLinear operation compared to prior SMoE implementations. How does it minimize allocations during backward pass? 

3. What are the advantages of exposed intermediate representations in ParallelLinear for easy extension to other expert modules? Demonstrate by implementing the Mixture of Attention module.

4. Analyze the performance of ParallelLinear method as sparsity is decreased (increasing k experts per token). How does it compare against a dense baseline and Megablocks implementation?

5. How does the concept of granularity affect the relative throughput of ParallelLinear versus Megablocks? Why does the proposed method seem better suited for high granularity settings?

6. Discuss the ScatterToScatter kernel and how it enables different input/output combinations of grouped or scattered linear transformations. What configurations are used for SMoE MLP?  

7. Compare and contrast the implemented Mixture of Multi-Head Attention formulation against Grouped-Query Attention. What are the differences in their expert groupings?

8. What optimization allows the Mixture of Attention module to not require additional memory allocations? How does this benefit over existing SMoE implementations?

9. Analyze the benchmarking experiments performed at both model-level (Mixtral) and unit-level (SMoE components). What throughput improvements does the proposed method achieve?

10. What potential extensions or improvements to ParallelLinear can you think of? How might exposed intermediate representations benefit novel expert modules?
