# [End-to-End Zero-Shot HOI Detection via Vision and Language Knowledge   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03541)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes EoID, an end-to-end zero-shot HOI detection framework that can detect both seen and unseen HOI categories. The key innovation is the transfer of vision and language knowledge from the pretrained CLIP model into the HOI detection model via region-level distillation. Specifically, the paper first designs an Interactive Score module and Two-stage Bipartite Matching algorithm to discover potential human-object pairs with interactions irrespective of the action categories. Then it transfers the distribution of action probabilities predicted by CLIP on the union regions of human-object pairs to teach the HOI model to recognize unseen actions. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det demonstrate that EoID outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods under various zero-shot settings by effectively detecting interactive pairs and identifying novel HOI categories. Moreover, EoID shows promising generalization ability to large-scale object detection datasets like MS-COCO to further scale up the action categories. The core value is advancing zero-shot HOI detection and reducing the annotation cost for new datasets.
