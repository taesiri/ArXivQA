# [Traffic Signal Control Using Lightweight Transformers: An   Offline-to-Online RL Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Efficient traffic signal control is critical for reducing traffic congestion and improving transportation efficiency. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control. However, existing RL solutions suffer from low sample efficiency and high computational cost, limiting their applicability in the real world. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DTLight, a lightweight transformer-based traffic signal control method that can learn from offline datasets without environment interaction. DTLight employs the Decision Transformer architecture to effectively model temporal dependencies in traffic flow. To reduce model complexity, it uses knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model into a smaller student model. Online fine-tuning is enabled through adapter modules that avoid full model retraining. DTLight is extended to decentralized multi-agent control by incorporating neighborhood state information.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of DTRL - the first public offline RL datasets for traffic signal control with 8 scenarios
- Novel offline-to-online RL approach for both single and multi-intersection traffic signal control using lightweight Decision Transformers  
- Knowledge distillation and adapter modules to obtain low-complexity models amenable to online fine-tuning
- Extensive experiments showing DTLight outperforms state-of-the-art online RL methods in most scenarios. Online fine-tuning further improves performance by up to 42.6%.

In summary, the paper proposes DTLight, an offline-to-online transformer-based solution for computationally efficient and adaptive traffic signal control. Rigorous evaluation demonstrates improved performance over existing methods. The introduced techniques for model compression and online adaptation helps enable the applicability of DTLight in real-world systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Creation of DTRL, the first publicly available offline datasets for traffic signal control using both synthetic and real-world scenarios with single and multiple signalized intersections.

2) Novel use of offline-to-online reinforcement learning to address both single and multiple signalized intersection traffic signal control problems. Specifically, proposal of DTLight, a new lightweight traffic signal controller based on Decision Transformer. It uses knowledge distillation to reduce model size and adapter modules for efficient online adaptation.

3) Enhancements to make DTLight more applicable to real-world traffic signal control problems. 

4) Demonstration through experiments that DTLight pre-trained purely on offline datasets can outperform state-of-the-art online RL methods in most scenarios. Additional experiments show online fine-tuning further improves DTLight performance significantly.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of DTLight, an offline-to-online RL method for traffic signal control that is simple, efficient, and outperforms existing approaches. The creation of benchmark offline datasets (DTRL) is also a key contribution.
