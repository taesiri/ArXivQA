# [Zero-shot Pose Transfer for Unrigged Stylized 3D Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00200)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper tries to address is how to transfer poses from a reference avatar (e.g. a human or animal) to stylized 3D characters with significantly different shapes, without requiring tedious manual rigging or paired training data of the stylized characters. 

The key hypothesis is that by disentangling shape and pose using a correspondence-aware shape module and implicit pose deformation module, and using efficient test-time tuning, their method can achieve realistic and accurate pose transfer to stylized characters in a zero-shot manner, using only readily available data such as posed human meshes for training.

In summary, the paper aims to develop an automated approach for pose transfer to stylized characters that does not rely on manual rigging or paired training data, which are big limitations of prior methods. The key ideas are shape/pose disentanglement and zero-shot generalization using proposed modules like correspondence-aware shape encoding and implicit pose deformation.
