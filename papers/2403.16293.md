# [Interpretable Modeling of Deep Reinforcement Learning Driven Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16293)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising results for cluster scheduling in high-performance computing (HPC), but lacks model interpretability which hinders its practical deployment. 
- The neural networks used in DRL act as black boxes, making them difficult to comprehend, debug, and adjust.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors present a framework called Interpretable Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to convert a DRL policy into an interpretable decision tree while maintaining high performance.  
- IRL uses imitation learning where the DRL agent (teacher) generates input-output sample data to train a decision tree (student). 
- To improve the decision tree's performance, IRL integrates the DAgger algorithm to iteratively aggregate more training data.  
- To reduce the size of the decision tree, IRL introduces the concept of "critical states" and only uses those states to construct the tree.

Main Contributions:
- IRL converts a black-box DRL policy into an interpretable decision tree that is easy for humans to understand and debug.
- Case studies demonstrate IRL's ability to analyze reward settings for DRL scheduling policies. 
- Experiments on workload traces show IRL achieves comparable performance to DRL scheduling while requiring lower runtime overhead.
- The decision tree from IRL maintains high scheduling performance while being 2-3x smaller in size compared to without using critical states.

In summary, IRL enables model interpretability for practical DRL cluster scheduling while preserving strong performance. The converted decision tree policy is straightforward for humans to comprehend and tune as needed.
