# [1-WL Expressiveness Is (Almost) All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether the limited expressiveness of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test and message passing neural networks (MPNNs) is actually a limiting factor for their performance on real-world graph datasets. The paper hypothesizes that despite the theoretical limitations of WL and MPNNs, their expressiveness is sufficient to identify most graphs and achieve high accuracy on standard benchmark datasets. Thus, the limited expressiveness may not be a major limiting factor in practice.To test this hypothesis, the paper analyzes the fraction of graphs identifiable by WL and the upper bounds on classification accuracy for WL-based models across several common graph datasets. The results show that WL can identify the vast majority of graphs in most datasets and allow near perfect accuracy, suggesting its expressiveness is not a major limitation. The paper also finds that simple WL-based neural networks can fit these datasets well, further supporting the claim.In summary, the central hypothesis is that despite theoretical expressiveness limits, WL and MPNNs are sufficiently expressive for real-world graph data, so developing more expressive methods may not be necessary to achieve strong performance. The paper aims to test this claim through empirical analysis.
