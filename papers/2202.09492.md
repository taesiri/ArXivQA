# [Highlighting Object Category Immunity for the Generalization of   Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09492)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new metric called mean performance degradation (mPD) to complement mAP for evaluating generalization in human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The authors observe that previous methods exhibit a large performance gap on different objects for the same verb, indicating poor generalization. To address this, they introduce the concept of object category (OC) immunity to prevent models from learning spurious OC-verb correlations as a shortcut. They design an OC-immune network with disentangled inputs and an OC-immune learning method for the object stream. Uncertainty quantification is incorporated to avoid overconfidence on unfamiliar objects. A calibration-aware unified inference mechanism is used to exploit the advantages of different streams. Experiments show significant improvements in both conventional and zero-shot settings. The method also has the benefit of utilizing unlabeled data. A new benchmark is introduced to facilitate research on HOI generalization. Overall, the paper makes multiple contributions around improving and evaluating generalization for HOI detection through the lens of OC immunity.
