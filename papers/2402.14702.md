# [InfFeed: Influence Functions as a Feedback to Improve the Performance of   Subjective Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks lack transparency and explainability, making them less trustworthy. 
- Influence functions can explain model predictions by quantifying the impact of individual training instances. 
- However, influence functions have not been used to directly improve model performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes InfFeed, a framework that uses influence functions as feedback to improve model performance for text classification tasks. 
- For a target instance, InfFeed identifies the most influential training instances and adjusts the target's label based on the labels of the influencers using majority/weighted voting.
- This provides a pseudo-expert annotation to revise potentially erroneous gold labels and improve performance.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate that influence functions can be an effective feedback mechanism to boost performance over SOTA baselines by up to 4% for hate speech detection, 3.5% for stance detection, 3% for irony detection and 2% for sarcasm detection. 
- Show that correcting only the negatively influencing subset of a silver-labeled dataset extension (1/1000th of dataset size) can achieve performance close to fully gold-labeled data. This greatly reduces annotation costs.
- Evaluate on diverse subjective tasks and datasets - hate speech, stance detection, irony, sarcasm over 6 benchmark datasets.
- Ablations show that influence functions are more effective than random label flipping or vanilla fine-tuning for providing annotation feedback.

In summary, the paper presents a novel use of influence functions as a pseudo-annotator feedback to enhance model performance across subjective text classification tasks while also reducing annotation costs.
