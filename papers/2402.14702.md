# [InfFeed: Influence Functions as a Feedback to Improve the Performance of   Subjective Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks lack transparency and explainability, making them less trustworthy. 
- Influence functions can explain model predictions by quantifying the impact of individual training instances. 
- However, influence functions have not been used to directly improve model performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes InfFeed, a framework that uses influence functions as feedback to improve model performance for text classification tasks. 
- For a target instance, InfFeed identifies the most influential training instances and adjusts the target's label based on the labels of the influencers using majority/weighted voting.
- This provides a pseudo-expert annotation to revise potentially erroneous gold labels and improve performance.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate that influence functions can be an effective feedback mechanism to boost performance over SOTA baselines by up to 4% for hate speech detection, 3.5% for stance detection, 3% for irony detection and 2% for sarcasm detection. 
- Show that correcting only the negatively influencing subset of a silver-labeled dataset extension (1/1000th of dataset size) can achieve performance close to fully gold-labeled data. This greatly reduces annotation costs.
- Evaluate on diverse subjective tasks and datasets - hate speech, stance detection, irony, sarcasm over 6 benchmark datasets.
- Ablations show that influence functions are more effective than random label flipping or vanilla fine-tuning for providing annotation feedback.

In summary, the paper presents a novel use of influence functions as a pseudo-annotator feedback to enhance model performance across subjective text classification tasks while also reducing annotation costs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called InfFeed that uses influence functions to adjust the labels of target instances based on the labels of their most influential training instances, improving model performance on subjective text classification tasks by 2-4\% over state-of-the-art baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a framework called \textsc{InfFeed} that uses influence functions as feedback to adjust the label of a data point based on the labels of its influencers. This is done to improve the model performance on subjective classification tasks. 

2. Evaluating \textsc{InfFeed} on six datasets covering tasks like hate speech detection, stance classification, irony and sarcasm detection. It is shown to outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 4\%, 3.5\%, 3\% and 2\% in terms of F1 score on these tasks.

3. Demonstrating that in a dataset extension setting, manually correcting only the negatively influencing data points (about 1/1000th of the full extension set) can result in performance very close to having the entire extension set gold annotated. This allows for large reduction in annotation costs.

In summary, the main contribution is using influence functions as a feedback mechanism to improve classification performance on subjective tasks and reduce annotation costs for dataset extension. The proposed \textsc{InfFeed} framework is shown to outperform strong baselines across multiple datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and key sections, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Influence functions - The paper proposes using influence functions to quantify the impact of individual training instances on model predictions. This is a core concept.

- Feedback mechanism - The paper introduces InfFeed, which uses influence functions to provide feedback to the model to improve its performance. This feedback mechanism is a key contribution.  

- Subjective tasks - The proposed approach is evaluated on highly subjective tasks like hate speech detection, stance classification, sarcasm detection, and irony detection. These tasks are central to the paper's focus.

- Pseudo-annotator - InfFeed uses the influence functions to adjust labels of instances like a "pseudo-annotator". This concept of pseudo-annotation is important.

- Dataset extension - The paper shows influence functions can identify data points to manually check/correct to improve performance when extending a dataset. So dataset extension is a key application.

- Annotation cost reduction - By selecting subsets to manually annotate, influence functions can greatly reduce overall annotation cost. So cost reduction is a notable benefit.

Some other potentially relevant terms include label correction, influential instances, majority voting, performance improvement, and manually relabelling. But the terms above seem to be the most central and important keywords for this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using influence functions as a feedback mechanism to improve model performance. Can you explain in more detail how the influence functions are calculated and incorporated as feedback? What are the computational challenges with using influence functions?

2. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several subjective classification tasks like hate speech detection and stance classification. Why are influence functions particularly useful for improving performance on subjective tasks compared to more objective tasks? 

3. When using influence functions to update the labels of data points in the fine-tuning set, the paper experiments with both majority voting and weighted voting. What are the differences between these two voting schemes? Under what conditions might one voting scheme outperform the other?

4. The paper shows the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Can you analyze the differences between the baselines and why influence functions provide better performance? What are the limitations of the baselines?  

5. For the dataset extension experiments, how does the paper use influence functions to reduce annotation cost? Explain the experimental setup and results for this in more detail. Approximately what fraction of the dataset needed re-annotation?

6. The paper conducts ablation experiments with random label flipping and vanilla fine-tuning. Analyze these results - why do both approaches perform worse than using influence functions for label updates? What does this reveal about the benefits of influence functions?

7. Take one of the examples in Table 4 showing label changes after incorporating influence function feedback. Analyze this example in depth - why was the original label incorrect and how did the influential instances result in correcting it?

8. The paper categorizes several types of errors made by the proposed model after qualitative analysis. Pick one error type and suggest ways the method could be improved to address this type of error.  

9. The paper uses a computationally efficient approximation of influence functions. What limitations might this place on the performance and application of the method? How could the full computation of influence functions change the results?

10. The method relies on finding the most influential training instances for each data point in the fine-tuning set. How might the performance change with different numbers of influential instances (the paper uses top-K)? What risks arise from considering too few or too many influential instances?
