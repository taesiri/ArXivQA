# [MuNES: Multifloor Navigation Including Elevators and Stairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04535)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for multifloor mapping create separate maps for each floor or a single map with connected floors. Both approaches have limitations:
    - Separate maps per floor can be inconsistent across floors and may not represent connections like stairs/elevators.
    - Single connected maps using LiDAR odometry fail to detect altitude changes inside elevators.
- For multifloor trajectory planning, existing methods either ignore interfloor connections or only consider stairs, not elevators. They cannot find optimal trajectories across multiple route choices.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose MuNES, a scheme for single mapping and trajectory planning including elevators and stairs.
- For mapping:
    - It estimates altitude changes inside elevators using pressure sensor data as constraints to refine the mapping. 
    - It performs floor-based loop detection for faster, more accurate loop closure.
- The map is voxelized for trajectory planning, keeping only necessary spaces like hallways, stairs and elevators.
- The A* algorithm is used for trajectory planning with a cost function considering realistic factors like elevator waiting time.

Main Contributions:
- First application of multifloor Traveling Salesman Problem (MF-TSP) to mobile robot navigation.
- Creates a single, accurate multifloor map using pressure-based altitude constraints and floor-based loop detection. 
- Plans optimal, realistic multifloor trajectories by considering route options like stairs/elevators and wait times.
- Evaluated on a university campus showing improved mapping accuracy and ability to select optimal routes between floors based on start/end points and elevator positions.

In summary, MuNES enables mobile robots to create accurate maps of multifloor environments including interfloor connectivity and to efficiently plan optimal trajectories spanning multiple floors using multiple types of vertical routes.
