# [Skinned Motion Retargeting with Residual Perception of Motion Semantics   &amp; Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we design an end-to-end neural motion retargeting method that preserves motion semantics and handles character geometry to avoid common artifacts like interpenetration and missing contacts, without needing cumbersome post-processing?

The key points are:

- The authors aim to develop an end-to-end neural network approach for motion retargeting. This contrasts with prior work that relies more on optimization or post-processing. 

- Their method focuses on two key challenges in motion retargeting:
  - Preserving motion semantics when retargeting between characters.
  - Avoiding interpenetration and missing contacts by considering character geometry.
  
- Their goal is to handle these challenges within a single neural network without needing additional post-processing steps.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design an end-to-end neural approach for motion retargeting that explicitly handles motion semantics and character geometry to generate high quality results without post-processing. The paper proposes a residual retargeting network architecture to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel residual network structure R^2ET for neural motion retargeting, which consists of a skeleton-aware module, a shape-aware module, and a balancing gate. 

2. Introducing a normalized joint Distance Matrix to explicitly model motion semantics and guide the training of the skeleton-aware module. 

3. Designing two voxelized Distance Fields, i.e. the Repulsive Distance Field (RDF) and the Attractive Distance Field (ADF), to achieve differentiable pose adjustment learning in an end-to-end manner.

4. Presenting a balancing gate to make trade-offs between skeleton-level and geometry-level motion modifications through learning an adjusting weight.

5. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Mixamo dataset without requiring any post-processing, while providing a good balance between preserving motion semantics and avoiding interpenetration/contact-missing.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the residual network structure R^2ET and the associated techniques for explicit motion semantics modeling and differentiable pose adjustment learning. This allows end-to-end training to generate plausible retargeted motions that balance semantics preservation and geometry compatibility.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field of motion retargeting:

- This paper focuses on neural network-based approaches to motion retargeting, building on recent deep learning work like NKN, PMNet, and SAN. Many earlier methods relied more on optimization and hand-crafted constraints. So this fits into the newer learning-based trend.

- A key contribution seems to be the explicit modeling and preservation of motion semantics using things like the distance matrix. This is a way to try to capture the meaning/intent of the motions, beyond just raw poses and trajectories. Many previous methods don't focus as much on this semantic level.

- The proposed residual retargeting framework and the use of the two modification modules (skeleton-aware and shape-aware) is novel compared to prior work. This allows adjusting the motion in a more nuanced way to fit the target.

- The shape-aware geometry handling via distance fields and voxelization to enable end-to-end training is also a fairly new technique in this space.

- Overall it seems like an advance in being able to do plausible retargeting without needing extensive post-processing or optimization, while also giving more control over the semantic meaning of the motion. The evaluations also show improved results.

So in summary, it builds on recent deep learning work but contributes new techniques for motion semantics preservation, residual retargeting modules, and geometry handling that advance the state of the art and offer improved performance. The comparisons to several prior methods help situate the improvements.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a residual neural network called R^2ET for motion retargeting that uses a skeleton-aware module to preserve motion semantics, a shape-aware module to avoid interpenetration and missing contacts, and a balancing gate to trade off between skeleton-level and geometry-level adjustments - achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Mixamo dataset without needing post-processing.
