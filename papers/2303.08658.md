# [Skinned Motion Retargeting with Residual Perception of Motion Semantics   &amp; Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we design an end-to-end neural motion retargeting method that preserves motion semantics and handles character geometry to avoid common artifacts like interpenetration and missing contacts, without needing cumbersome post-processing?

The key points are:

- The authors aim to develop an end-to-end neural network approach for motion retargeting. This contrasts with prior work that relies more on optimization or post-processing. 

- Their method focuses on two key challenges in motion retargeting:
  - Preserving motion semantics when retargeting between characters.
  - Avoiding interpenetration and missing contacts by considering character geometry.
  
- Their goal is to handle these challenges within a single neural network without needing additional post-processing steps.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design an end-to-end neural approach for motion retargeting that explicitly handles motion semantics and character geometry to generate high quality results without post-processing. The paper proposes a residual retargeting network architecture to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel residual network structure R^2ET for neural motion retargeting, which consists of a skeleton-aware module, a shape-aware module, and a balancing gate. 

2. Introducing a normalized joint Distance Matrix to explicitly model motion semantics and guide the training of the skeleton-aware module. 

3. Designing two voxelized Distance Fields, i.e. the Repulsive Distance Field (RDF) and the Attractive Distance Field (ADF), to achieve differentiable pose adjustment learning in an end-to-end manner.

4. Presenting a balancing gate to make trade-offs between skeleton-level and geometry-level motion modifications through learning an adjusting weight.

5. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Mixamo dataset without requiring any post-processing, while providing a good balance between preserving motion semantics and avoiding interpenetration/contact-missing.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the residual network structure R^2ET and the associated techniques for explicit motion semantics modeling and differentiable pose adjustment learning. This allows end-to-end training to generate plausible retargeted motions that balance semantics preservation and geometry compatibility.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field of motion retargeting:

- This paper focuses on neural network-based approaches to motion retargeting, building on recent deep learning work like NKN, PMNet, and SAN. Many earlier methods relied more on optimization and hand-crafted constraints. So this fits into the newer learning-based trend.

- A key contribution seems to be the explicit modeling and preservation of motion semantics using things like the distance matrix. This is a way to try to capture the meaning/intent of the motions, beyond just raw poses and trajectories. Many previous methods don't focus as much on this semantic level.

- The proposed residual retargeting framework and the use of the two modification modules (skeleton-aware and shape-aware) is novel compared to prior work. This allows adjusting the motion in a more nuanced way to fit the target.

- The shape-aware geometry handling via distance fields and voxelization to enable end-to-end training is also a fairly new technique in this space.

- Overall it seems like an advance in being able to do plausible retargeting without needing extensive post-processing or optimization, while also giving more control over the semantic meaning of the motion. The evaluations also show improved results.

So in summary, it builds on recent deep learning work but contributes new techniques for motion semantics preservation, residual retargeting modules, and geometry handling that advance the state of the art and offer improved performance. The comparisons to several prior methods help situate the improvements.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a residual neural network called R^2ET for motion retargeting that uses a skeleton-aware module to preserve motion semantics, a shape-aware module to avoid interpenetration and missing contacts, and a balancing gate to trade off between skeleton-level and geometry-level adjustments - achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Mixamo dataset without needing post-processing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the robustness of the method to noisy motion data. The authors note that one potential limitation is noise in the Mixamo dataset they used. They suggest trying to reduce interference from noise in future work.

- Handling foot contact. The authors state foot contact is not a focus of their current method but could be addressed by incorporating techniques from other work like Aberman et al.

- Extending the method to retarget motions estimated from RGB videos. The current method focuses on animated characters with skeletons, but the authors suggest it could be extended to retarget motions from SMPL models estimated from video. 

- Exploring other potential applications of the distance measurements proposed. The authors introduce normalized distance matrices for motion semantics and distance fields for geometry awareness. They suggest these measurements could have broader applications for motion modeling beyond just this retargeting method.

- Improving the flexibility of the balancing between semantics and geometry. The current balancing gate provides some user control, but more adaptive balancing could be explored.

- Validating on more diverse datasets. The experiments are limited to the Mixamo dataset. Testing on more varied data could better demonstrate the generalization of the method.

- Comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods like recent contact-aware models. The authors note limitations in comparison to some very recent work.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the robustness, flexibility and validation of the method, extending it to new data domains like video, and comparisons to the latest state-of-the-art techniques. The distance measurements also provide opportunities for exploration in other motion modeling applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel residual retargeting network (R2ET) for motion retargeting between characters with different skeletons and shapes. The network has two main components - a skeleton-aware module that adjusts the motion to preserve semantics based on the skeleton, and a shape-aware module that modifies the motion to avoid interpenetration and maintain contact based on the character's 3D shape. The network takes a residual learning approach where it learns to make small modifications to the copied source motion to retarget it, rather than directly predicting the full target motion. This helps maintain coherence and reduces the search space. The training is guided by explicit losses that match distance relationships between joints to preserve semantics, and use distance fields to enable differentiable learning of interpenetration avoidance. A balancing gate is introduced to trade off between semantics preservation and interpenetration reduction. Experiments on the Mixamo dataset show state-of-the-art results in retargeting complex motions to characters with very different geometries. The network can plausibly retarget motions in a single pass without post-processing.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper: 

The paper proposes a residual retargeting network (R2ET) for motion retargeting between characters. The network takes a source motion as input and outputs a retargeted motion for the target character. It consists of two main modification modules - a skeleton-aware module and a shape-aware module. The skeleton-aware module adjusts the motion to preserve semantics based on differences in skeleton configurations. It uses a transformer structure and is trained with a normalized distance matrix supervision. The shape-aware module senses shape geometry differences to avoid interpenetration and missing contacts. It is trained with repulsive and attractive losses computed using distance fields. A balancing gate is used to balance the two modifications. With this residual design and distance-based losses, the network can generate plausible retargeted motions in a single pass without post-processing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel residual retargeting network (R^2ET) for motion retargeting. The goal is to map the motion from a source character to a target character while preserving the motion semantics and avoiding interpenetration and missing contacts. The network has a residual structure that takes the source motion as initialization and learns modifications through two modules - a skeleton-aware module to maintain motion semantics and a shape-aware module to avoid interpenetration based on target shape geometry. 

The skeleton-aware module uses a transformer structure to learn pairwise joint relationships and explicitly models motion semantics through a normalized distance matrix between joints. The shape-aware module uses repulsive and attractive distance fields to guide pose adjustment and avoid penetrations in an end-to-end manner. A balancing gate is introduced to tradeoff between the two modifications through a learned weight. Experiments on the Mixamo dataset show state-of-the-art results in preserving motion semantics while reducing interpenetration and missing contacts without any post-processing. The residual structure also leads to more coherent motion retargeting.

In summary, the key ideas are the residual network structure, the use of explicit motion semantics modeling through joint distance matrices, and differentiable geometry perception using distance fields to enable end-to-end learning of motion retargeting that balances semantics and geometry. The approach achieves improved results on a public dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper addresses the problem of motion retargeting, which is transferring the motion from a source character to a target character while preserving the motion's plausibility. Specifically, the paper focuses on two key challenges in motion retargeting:

1. Preserving the semantics/meaning of the source motion when retargeting to characters with different skeletal configurations. 

2. Avoiding interpenetration and maintaining realistic contacts when retargeting motions to characters with different body shapes/geometries.

The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called R^2ET to tackle these challenges in an end-to-end manner without needing post-processing.

In summary, the key questions addressed are:

- How to preserve motion semantics when retargeting between characters with different skeletons?

- How to avoid interpenetration and maintain contacts when retargeting to characters with different body shapes? 

- How to balance motion semantics preservation and geometry plausibility in an end-to-end network without post-processing?

The R^2ET network incorporates novel components like a skeleton-aware module, shape-aware module and balancing gate to address these questions.
