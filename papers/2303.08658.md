# [Skinned Motion Retargeting with Residual Perception of Motion Semantics   &amp; Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we design an end-to-end neural motion retargeting method that preserves motion semantics and handles character geometry to avoid common artifacts like interpenetration and missing contacts, without needing cumbersome post-processing?

The key points are:

- The authors aim to develop an end-to-end neural network approach for motion retargeting. This contrasts with prior work that relies more on optimization or post-processing. 

- Their method focuses on two key challenges in motion retargeting:
  - Preserving motion semantics when retargeting between characters.
  - Avoiding interpenetration and missing contacts by considering character geometry.
  
- Their goal is to handle these challenges within a single neural network without needing additional post-processing steps.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design an end-to-end neural approach for motion retargeting that explicitly handles motion semantics and character geometry to generate high quality results without post-processing. The paper proposes a residual retargeting network architecture to achieve this.
