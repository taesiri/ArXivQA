# [Skinned Motion Retargeting with Residual Perception of Motion Semantics   &amp; Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we design an end-to-end neural motion retargeting method that preserves motion semantics and handles character geometry to avoid common artifacts like interpenetration and missing contacts, without needing cumbersome post-processing?

The key points are:

- The authors aim to develop an end-to-end neural network approach for motion retargeting. This contrasts with prior work that relies more on optimization or post-processing. 

- Their method focuses on two key challenges in motion retargeting:
  - Preserving motion semantics when retargeting between characters.
  - Avoiding interpenetration and missing contacts by considering character geometry.
  
- Their goal is to handle these challenges within a single neural network without needing additional post-processing steps.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design an end-to-end neural approach for motion retargeting that explicitly handles motion semantics and character geometry to generate high quality results without post-processing. The paper proposes a residual retargeting network architecture to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel residual network structure R^2ET for neural motion retargeting, which consists of a skeleton-aware module, a shape-aware module, and a balancing gate. 

2. Introducing a normalized joint Distance Matrix to explicitly model motion semantics and guide the training of the skeleton-aware module. 

3. Designing two voxelized Distance Fields, i.e. the Repulsive Distance Field (RDF) and the Attractive Distance Field (ADF), to achieve differentiable pose adjustment learning in an end-to-end manner.

4. Presenting a balancing gate to make trade-offs between skeleton-level and geometry-level motion modifications through learning an adjusting weight.

5. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Mixamo dataset without requiring any post-processing, while providing a good balance between preserving motion semantics and avoiding interpenetration/contact-missing.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the residual network structure R^2ET and the associated techniques for explicit motion semantics modeling and differentiable pose adjustment learning. This allows end-to-end training to generate plausible retargeted motions that balance semantics preservation and geometry compatibility.
