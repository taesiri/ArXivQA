# [SDGE: Stereo Guided Depth Estimation for 360Â° Camera Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11791)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Depth estimation from 360-degree multi-camera systems has important applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods have limitations - they rely on perfect ground truth supervision which is hard to obtain (for fisheye cameras), have small overlapping regions (for pinhole cameras) making stereo methods infeasible, or do not explicitly enforce multi-view consistency.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Stereo Guided Depth Estimation (SGDE) pipeline to address these issues. The key ideas are:

(1) Build virtual pinhole cameras from fisheye cameras to handle distortion and unify processing. 

(2) Optimize relative camera poses using surrounding view calibration with geometric loop constraints. This gives highly accurate poses compared to noisy dataset ground truth.

(3) Compute high-quality depth prior on overlap regions using robust stereo methods with the optimized poses.

(4) Use depth prior as input and supervision to depth networks - provides guidance and consistency.

Main Contributions:

(1) A general SGDE pipeline for both fisheye and pinhole 360 camera rigs using explicit geometric guidance from stereo methods.

(2) Virtual pinhole camera modeling and surrounding view calibration method to enable effective use of stereo techniques.

(3) Depth prior serves as input and pseudo ground truth for depth networks, improving performance and cross-view consistency.

(4) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with supervised and self-supervised settings. Also helps downstream tasks like 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction.
