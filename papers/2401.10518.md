# [Spatial-temporal Forecasting for Regions without Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10518)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of spatial-temporal forecasting for a region that has no historical observations, while adjacent regions have recorded data. Existing methods assume some data availability in the region of interest, either temporarily or at scattered locations. They fail to handle scenarios where a continuous region/sub-region has no observations at all due to issues like lack of sensor deployment, resources or open data.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new model called STSM that can learn from adjacent regions and extend forecasting capability to the region of interest. The key ideas are:

1) Selective Masking Module: It computes similarity between sub-graphs of observed regions and the unobserved region based on regional features, road network and spatial distance. Sub-graphs with higher similarity have a higher chance of being masked. This allows learning patterns from locations most similar to the unobserved region.

2) Contrastive Learning Module: It takes a graph view with complete data and constructs an augmentation view by masking locations. Contrastive loss maximizes agreement between outputs, making the predictions robust to incomplete inputs.

3) Spatial-Temporal Modelling Module: It uses GCNs and 1D CNNs to capture spatial and temporal correlations. Pseudo-observations are generated for unobserved locations to enable message passing in GCNs.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new spatial-temporal forecasting task for regions without any historical observations

- Designs a selective masking module to mask observed sub-graphs most similar to the unobserved region, enhancing generalization

- Employs graph contrastive learning to improve prediction accuracy on incomplete data 

- Outperforms state-of-the-art models on traffic and air quality datasets, with lower errors and higher R2

The model is robust to factors like extent of missing data, sensor density changes, etc. It also allows incorporating more advanced temporal modeling techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new spatial-temporal forecasting model called STSM that can make predictions for a region without historical observations by learning patterns from adjacent regions with data through a selective masking strategy and contrastive learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new spatial-temporal forecasting task - forecasting for regions without historical observations. This can address issues like unbalanced region development and lack of open data.

2. Designing a selective masking module to guide the model (STSM) to mask observed locations that are more similar to the unobserved region. This helps the model generalize its forecasting capability from the masked locations to the unobserved region. 

3. Designing an efficient pseudo-observation generation strategy and computing a temporal adjacency matrix based on it to identify more informative neighbours and enhance the model's learning efficacy.

4. Extensive experiments showing that the proposed model STSM outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models consistently in terms of forecasting accuracy over both traffic and air pollutant forecasting tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new forecasting task for regions without observations and an effective model STSM to address this task. The selective masking module, efficient pseudo-observation strategy and temporal adjacency matrix help STSM outperform existing models.
