# [MultiView Independent Component Analysis with Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00484)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new algorithm called MultiView Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) for blind source separation when multiple views of the same underlying sources are available. It builds on the MultiView ICA (MVICA) model by allowing sources to have different temporal delays across views, overcoming MVICA's limitation of assuming perfectly aligned sources. Specifically, MVICAD incorporates estimated integer delays to align sources across iterations when optimizing the model likelihood. Through simulations, the authors demonstrate superior source separation performance over MVICA when delays are present. They also show age-correlated delays when applying MVICAD to MEG data from the Cam-CAN dataset, indicating the model's ability to recover meaningful delays related to neural processing. Overall, by accounting for inter-view delays, MVICAD advances multi-view ICA to better reconstruct latent sources and reveal rich cross-subject effects without supervision.
