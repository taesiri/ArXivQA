# [Towards Engineering Fair and Equitable Software Systems for Managing   Low-Altitude Airspace Authorizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), also called drones, are rapidly increasing in popularity and use, leading to more congested airspace. This raises safety concerns and incidents.  
- To manage drone traffic, the FAA is developing an automated UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system that will approve or deny flight requests based on safety factors.
- However, designing an automated system for flight authorizations is complex. It must balance competing concerns like safety, fairness, transparency, and public acceptance across diverse stakeholders.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors conducted an initial exploratory survey to understand stakeholders' perspectives on important factors in automated flight authorization decisions. 
- The survey collected both quantitative ratings and qualitative concerns using vignettes - simplified flight authorization scenarios.

Key Contributions:
- Identified critical factors: weather, mission complexity were top factors, while pilot/drone history were less important.  
- Revealed divergent subgroup opinions on authorization decisions, highlighting the difficulty of establishing fair criteria.
- Uncovered concerns about fully automated AI-based decisions, with preferences for human oversight.
- Highlighted the need for community input during system design to improve transparency and acceptance.

In summary, this initial study explores stakeholders' views on automated drone flight authorizations to inform the design of transparent, fair and socially acceptable software systems for managing future drone traffic. Key findings indicate the importance of human involvement and community engagement in developing such automated decision-making systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper reports on a preliminary study eliciting perspectives from drone operators, emergency responders, and community members regarding factors important for making fair automated decisions on approving drone flights in shared airspace and highlights concerns about using AI for such decisions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper reports on an initial exploratory study to elicit stakeholders' perspectives on factors important for making fair, equitable and safe automated flight authorization decisions in UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems. Specifically, the study investigates: (1) key factors influencing stakeholders' perceptions of fairness and safety in the flight authorization decision-making process, and (2) concerns stakeholders have regarding automated solutions, especially AI-assisted ones, for flight authorizations. The findings reveal divergent views on important decision factors that could impact equitable airspace access, as well as concerns about fully automated systems. The authors argue this underscores the need to engage diverse stakeholders and consider safety issues as detailed flight authorization requests are investigated in future work.

In summary, the main contribution is the initial study exploring stakeholders' views on automated flight authorization decisions in UTM systems, focused on issues of fairness, equity and safety. The findings motivate and help frame follow-on research in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. What are some of the key benefits and drawbacks of using this type of methodology for the research questions posed in the study? How could the methodology be improved in future work?

2. The authors used vignettes to elicit perspectives from participants. What are some of the strengths and limitations of using vignettes? How was the validity and reliability of the vignettes assessed? 

3. Table 2 shows the constructs, levels, and attributes used to design the vignettes. What process did the authors use to select these? Could additional constructs or attributes have been included to provide a more comprehensive set of vignettes?

4. Nine vignettes were selected to be evaluated by each respondent. What considerations and tradeoffs went into determining this number? Could additional vignettes have provided more insight?

5. The Likert scale questions asked participants to rate the importance of broad constructs such as "pilot history." How could more specific attribute-level questions have provided additional granularity into the decision-making factors?  

6. The participant sample size was 46. What are some of the limitations of having this sample size? How was the determination made that 46 was an adequate number?

7. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative responses. What process was used for coder training? How was inter-rater reliability assessed?

8. How generalizable are the results? In what ways could the sampling have been broader to better represent the full range of stakeholders?  

9. What process was used to mitigate experimenter bias in designing the study and analyzing the results? Was member-checking used to validate findings with participants?

10. The study resulted in some divergent viewpoints between participant groups. What implications do these differences have for the design of an equitable automated system? How can future research better understand these differing viewpoints?
