# [Envisioning the Next-Generation AI Coding Assistants: Insights &amp;   Proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The authors are from an industry research team that builds IDE plugins utilizing AI techniques from their academic research branch. 
- They want to share lessons learned from adapting academic AI innovations to enterprise use cases when developing IDE assistive tools.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose that successful AI-powered IDE assistive tools should:
  1) Set clear expectations on capabilities and provide extensive features
  2) Integrate with IDE's native functions and existing plugins 
  3) Use modular backend architectures to enable updates
  4) Collect in-product analytics on usage and impact

Key Contributions:
- This position paper shares real-world insights from an industrial research team on transitioning AI4SE innovations into commercial IDE plugins.
- It advises the AI4SE community to design tools not just for correctness, but also usability via human-centered design. 
- The authors urge researchers to consider downstream commercialization early when developing new techniques.
- They recommend that IDE builders employ observability best practices in their platforms to support validation of AI assistive technologies.

In summary, this paper provides a unique perspective from an industry AI research team on practical challenges in developing usable and impactful AI-powered assistive tools for software development environments. It gives constructive suggestions on how academic innovations in this space can translate effectively to enterprise scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content, it seems the main contribution of this paper is to share lessons learned and insights from the author's experience in combining research and engineering teams to build AI-assisted software engineering (AISE) tools. Specifically, the paper aims to:

1) Advise that AISE tools should:
- Inform users of explicit intended usages and provide rich feature sets
- Integrate with native IDE capabilities and extensions 
- Use extensible, loosely-coupled architectures
- Collect in-app metrics and metadata 

2) Propose where scholars and IDE developers could fruitfully invest their efforts in AISE

The paper shares these insights from the author's perspective of working in a combined research-product group that publishes AISE research and creates IDE plugins. The goal is to provide guidance on best practices and future directions based on their real-world experience in this area.
