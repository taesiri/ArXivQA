# [Envisioning the Next-Generation AI Coding Assistants: Insights &amp;   Proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The authors are from an industry research team that builds IDE plugins utilizing AI techniques from their academic research branch. 
- They want to share lessons learned from adapting academic AI innovations to enterprise use cases when developing IDE assistive tools.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose that successful AI-powered IDE assistive tools should:
  1) Set clear expectations on capabilities and provide extensive features
  2) Integrate with IDE's native functions and existing plugins 
  3) Use modular backend architectures to enable updates
  4) Collect in-product analytics on usage and impact

Key Contributions:
- This position paper shares real-world insights from an industrial research team on transitioning AI4SE innovations into commercial IDE plugins.
- It advises the AI4SE community to design tools not just for correctness, but also usability via human-centered design. 
- The authors urge researchers to consider downstream commercialization early when developing new techniques.
- They recommend that IDE builders employ observability best practices in their platforms to support validation of AI assistive technologies.

In summary, this paper provides a unique perspective from an industry AI research team on practical challenges in developing usable and impactful AI-powered assistive tools for software development environments. It gives constructive suggestions on how academic innovations in this space can translate effectively to enterprise scenarios.
