# [Towards Provable Log Density Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Policy gradient (PG) methods are widely used in reinforcement learning, but have some limitations. Specifically, practical implementations introduce a residual error by approximating the gradient using a discounted Q-function rather than the true average reward Q-function. This error can accumulate and lead to suboptimal solutions. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a "log density gradient" method to estimate the policy gradient without residual error. This is based on an alternative "average state-action stationary distribution" formulation of the RL problem.

- For tabular MDPs, the paper shows how to analytically calculate the exact log density gradient using linear equations involving the transition dynamics.

- For complex MDPs, a temporal difference (TD) algorithm is proposed to estimate the log density gradient using samples, but this relies on unrealistic backwards sampling. 

- To address the backwards sampling issue, a min-max optimization is proposed to estimate the log density gradient using only on-policy samples. Convergence and uniqueness results are proven under linear function approximation.

Main Contributions:

1. Log density gradient method to estimate policy gradients without residual error, with consistency result linking it to the classical policy gradient.

2. TD algorithm to estimate log density gradient relying on backwards sampling.

3. Min-max optimization for log density gradient estimation using on-policy samples only. Convergence and uniqueness results proven, and sample complexity bounded.

4. Empirical demonstration on gridworld environments showing improved performance over classical policy gradient approaches.

The key conclusion is that correcting for the residual gradient error may improve sample efficiency of policy gradient RL algorithms, enabling wider deployment. The log density gradient approach shows promise in addressing this.
