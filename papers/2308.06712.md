# [Compositional Feature Augmentation for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve scene graph generation (SGG) models to overcome bias towards predicting dominant/frequent (head) predicates and instead make more accurate predictions for rare (tail) predicates?The key hypothesis proposed is:Existing SGG debiasing methods like re-balancing fail to sufficiently increase diversity of relation triplet features, which is critical for robust SGG across head and tail classes. A compositional feature augmentation (CFA) approach can enrich tail triplet features and help learn proper decision boundaries.To summarize, the paper aims to tackle the issue of bias in SGG models by proposing a novel compositional learning strategy to augment features of tail predicate triplets, increasing their diversity. This is hypothesized to help models better distinguish tail classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Identifying an issue with existing re-balancing methods for unbiased scene graph generation (SGG) - that they fail to increase the diversity of relation triplet features, especially for tail predicates. 2. Proposing a novel Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA) framework to tackle the bias issue in SGG from the perspective of increasing triplet feature diversity. CFA consists of two components - intrinsic-CFA and extrinsic-CFA to augment the intrinsic and extrinsic features respectively.3. Showing through experiments that CFA can effectively improve the performance of various SGG models on benchmark datasets. CFA helps achieve better trade-off between metrics like mR@K and R@K.In summary, the key novelty is proposing compositional feature augmentation to increase triplet feature diversity for mitigating bias in SGG, instead of just re-balancing the data. The results demonstrate this is an effective strategy and CFA helps achieve new state-of-the-art performance on standard SGG benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA) method to address the bias issue in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) models caused by long-tailed predicate distributions, by enhancing the diversity of relation triplet features through augmenting both the intrinsic entity features and extrinsic context features.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA) for unbiased scene graph generation compares to other related works:- It proposes a new perspective on addressing bias in SGG models. Most prior work focuses on re-balancing strategies like re-sampling or re-weighting to handle the long-tailed predicate distributions. This paper argues these fail to increase diversity of relation triplet features for each predicate. Instead, CFA aims to directly enrich the feature diversity, especially for tail predicates.- The method takes a compositional learning approach with two complementary modules - intrinsic-CFA replaces entity features to augment intrinsic information, while extrinsic-CFA mixes context triplets to augment extrinsic context. This leverages both components of a relation triplet feature. - The approach is model-agnostic and plug-and-play, demonstrated by consistency improving various SGG model architectures. Many prior debiasing methods are tailored or coupled to specific models.- It achieves state-of-the-art trade-off performance on VG and GQA datasets, with especially large gains on mean Recall which considers both head and tail predicates. This shows CFA's ability to improve tail without excessively sacrificing head.- The feature augmentation perspective and compositional framework seem novel compared to prior SGG debiasing techniques. The closest related works compose new samples but don't focus on diversity or leverage both intrinsic and extrinsic features.Overall, the CFA approach provides a new model-agnostic angle on handling bias in SGG models by directly manipulating relation triplet features. The promising results suggest this is a valuable direction compared to existing work dominated by re-balancing strategies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Apply CFA to one-stage SGG models by augmenting image-level features. The paper focuses on two-stage models, so extending CFA to one-stage frameworks is noted as an area for future work.- Extend CFA to compose new relation triplet features by fusing features from open-vocabulary categories or other image domains. The paper notes this could further increase the diversity of features for rare predicates. - Explore new similarity metrics or clustering methods for selecting replaceable entity features in intrinsic CFA. The ablation studies suggest there is room to improve entity selection.- Investigate adaptive or learned approaches to selecting the mixup parameter theta in extrinsic CFA, rather than setting a fixed value. A learned approach could potentially optimize theta per sample.- Study the impact of CFA on other downstream tasks reliant on SGG, such as VQA, captioning or retrieval. The paper focuses evaluation on SGG benchmarks.- Explore ensemble methods that combine CFA with other debiasing techniques like re-balancing. The paper positions CFA as an alternative to re-balancing but they could be complementary.- Evaluate CFA on additional SGG datasets and model architectures to further probe its generalizability. The paper demonstrates results on VG and GQA datasets.In summary, the main suggestions are around extending CFA to other SGG setups, improving the feature augmentation techniques, and evaluating the impact on downstream tasks. The overall goal is to further demonstrate the effectiveness of CFA for unbiased SGG.
