# [Compositional Feature Augmentation for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve scene graph generation (SGG) models to overcome bias towards predicting dominant/frequent (head) predicates and instead make more accurate predictions for rare (tail) predicates?The key hypothesis proposed is:Existing SGG debiasing methods like re-balancing fail to sufficiently increase diversity of relation triplet features, which is critical for robust SGG across head and tail classes. A compositional feature augmentation (CFA) approach can enrich tail triplet features and help learn proper decision boundaries.To summarize, the paper aims to tackle the issue of bias in SGG models by proposing a novel compositional learning strategy to augment features of tail predicate triplets, increasing their diversity. This is hypothesized to help models better distinguish tail classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Identifying an issue with existing re-balancing methods for unbiased scene graph generation (SGG) - that they fail to increase the diversity of relation triplet features, especially for tail predicates. 2. Proposing a novel Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA) framework to tackle the bias issue in SGG from the perspective of increasing triplet feature diversity. CFA consists of two components - intrinsic-CFA and extrinsic-CFA to augment the intrinsic and extrinsic features respectively.3. Showing through experiments that CFA can effectively improve the performance of various SGG models on benchmark datasets. CFA helps achieve better trade-off between metrics like mR@K and R@K.In summary, the key novelty is proposing compositional feature augmentation to increase triplet feature diversity for mitigating bias in SGG, instead of just re-balancing the data. The results demonstrate this is an effective strategy and CFA helps achieve new state-of-the-art performance on standard SGG benchmarks.
