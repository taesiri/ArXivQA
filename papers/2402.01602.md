# [Foundation Model Sherpas: Guiding Foundation Models through Knowledge   and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Foundation models (FMs) like large language models have shown remarkable capabilities, but also have limitations around alignment, traceability, interpretability, reasoning ability, knowledge incorporation, and generalizability. The paper argues that FMs need to be suitably guided for broader adoption in real-world systems.

Proposed Solution - Sherpas Framework:  
The paper proposes a conceptual framework where different types of "sherpa" agents interact with and guide an FM as it tackles user-specified tasks. Sherpas leverage knowledge and reasoning to address FM limitations. Four main sherpa categories are:

1) FM Updaters: Modify the FM itself using approaches like knowledge infusion, fine-tuning, model editing, or controlled generation.

2) Prompt Assistants: Help with prompt engineering, using strategies like instruction-based prompts, in-context learning prompts, or decomposed prompting.  

3) Assessors: Evaluate FM outputs on attributes like quality, harmfulness, factuality, uncertainty to improve trustworthiness.

4) Knowledge Curators: Curate knowledge from sources like KGs to support the FM.

The framework also has a special "Orchestrator" sherpa to manage workflows.

Main Contributions:

- Conceptualization of different sherpa roles for guiding FMs 

- Taxonomy depicting how various state-of-the-art approaches utilize combinations of the sherpa categories

- Categorization of agent interaction protocols based on extent of reasoning involved - (i) Update FM (ii) Access Tools (iii) Dynamic Prompts (iv) External Reasoners

- Analysis of current work and opportunities around smarter agent behaviors and human involvement for sherpas

- Discussion of open challenges like multi-objective optimization, broader automated assessors, uncertainty quantification, more knowledge enablement avenues, and new benchmarks.

In summary, the proposed sherpas framework provides useful guidance on the design of FM-based systems by elucidating agent roles and interactions. The paper surveys the landscape around knowledge and reasoning for guiding FMs, while also identifying promising future research directions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a conceptual framework with agent roles for guiding foundation models to perform tasks through knowledge augmentation and reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a conceptual framework called the "sherpas framework" that categorizes different types of agents that can interact with and guide foundation models. Specifically, the framework defines agent roles such as FM Updaters, Prompt Assistants, Assessors, Knowledge Curators, and Orchestrators. The paper also categorizes existing approaches for guiding foundation models into four types of agent interaction protocols: 

1) Update FM with External Knowledge 
2) Access Tools for Information Retrieval
3) Explore Dynamic Prompts
4) Integrate External Reasoners

The framework and categorization aim to provide guidance for future research directions in developing more capable and trustworthy systems involving foundation models and associated guiding agents.

The paper proposes a conceptual framework that categorizes different "sherpa" agents that can interact with and guide foundation models. It discusses various roles for agents, such as updating the models, assisting with prompting, assessing outputs, curating knowledge sources, and orchestrating workflows. The paper also discusses and provides examples of different interaction protocols between agents, and highlights opportunities for further research, especially around integrating formal reasoning methods and human involvement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a conceptual framework with different agent roles for guiding foundation models. Can you elaborate on the key categories of agents and their intended purpose in this framework?

2. The paper discusses agent interaction protocols that incorporate the different agents. Can you describe the four main categories of protocols highlighted and how they differ in terms of reasoning and orchestration? 

3. The Assessor agents evaluate attributes of foundation model outputs. What are some of the key attributes that are pertinent to either the quality of generation or trustworthiness? Can you give some examples of work that assess these?

4. Knowledge infusion during additional pretraining of foundation models is discussed as one way that FM Updater agents can modify the models. What are some of the other categories of updaters and how do they differ in terms of directly modifying the foundation model versus controlling its generation?

5. What are the differences between instruction-based, in-context learning, and decomposed prompts? How do the Prompt Assistant and Prompt Sequencer agents leverage these different types of prompts?

6. The paper discusses integrating external reasoners as one category of interaction protocols. Can you describe some of the probabilistic and symbolic reasoning frameworks that have been integrated with foundation models through this approach? 

7. The Orchestrators manage interactions between the other agents. What are some ways orchestration differs between the protocols focused on accessing tools versus those exploring dynamic prompts?

8. How does the notion of agency and desirable agent behaviors relate to the vision laid out in the paper? What kinds of autonomous, interactive, reactive and proactive behaviors are envisaged for the FM guiding agents?

9. What are some limitations of current work highlighted in the paper? What future directions are identified to address those limitations through extensions of the framework and agent interactions?

10. How do the notions of joint optimization and collaboration between agents open up new possibilities compared to most existing work that looks at individual agent roles? What kinds of joint optimization problems can you foresee?
