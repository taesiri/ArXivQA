# [AvatarBooth: High-Quality and Customizable 3D Human Avatar Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09864)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goals and hypotheses of this paper are:- To develop a novel method for generating high-quality, customizable 3D human avatars from text prompts and/or images. The central hypothesis is that using dual fine-tuned diffusion models for the face and body along with other techniques will allow higher quality avatar generation compared to previous approaches.- To enable identity-customized avatar generation from arbitrary input images while still supporting text-based editing. The hypothesis is that fine-tuning diffusion models on personal photos along with introducing pose-consistent constraints will transfer facial and body appearance details to the generated avatar. - To achieve detailed 3D avatar generation through a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy. The hypothesis is that a multi-resolution score distillation scheme will improve rendering quality and robustness compared to fixed-resolution supervision.- To demonstrate that the proposed techniques of dual model fine-tuning, pose-consistent constraints, and multi-resolution score distillation allow higher quality and more customizable avatar generation compared to prior arts. The hypothesis is that the avatars generated by the proposed AvatarBooth framework will be more realistic, detailed, and controllable.In summary, the central goal is generating customizable, high-fidelity 3D avatars using diffusion model guidance and image/text inputs. The key hypotheses are around the benefits of the proposed model fine-tuning strategies, constraints, and multi-resolution supervision in achieving improved avatar quality and control compared to previous state-of-the-art.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose a new framework AvatarBooth for generating high-quality 3D avatars from text prompts or images. The key idea is to use separate latent diffusion models to supervise the generation of the face and body. This allows capturing intricate facial details as well as clothing/accessories.2. They introduce a pose-consistent constraint during diffusion model fine-tuning. This enhances the consistency of synthesized head images across different poses and improves avatar geometry. 3. They present a multi-resolution score distillation sampling strategy that enables coarse-to-fine optimization of the avatar model. This enhances both rendering quality and training stability/robustness.4. Their method supports three modes: text prompt only, appearance customization from images, and a hybrid mode that allows further text-based editing of customized avatars. This provides flexibility in generating avatars.5. Experiments show their approach outperforms previous text-to-3D and image-to-3D avatar generation methods in terms of visual quality, geometry, and faithfulness to input prompts/images.In summary, the main contribution is a new avatar generation framework that leverages separate diffusion models for face/body along with innovations like pose-consistent fine-tuning and multi-resolution optimization. This allows high-quality customizable avatar creation from both text and images.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called AvatarBooth for generating high-quality and customizable 3D human avatars from text prompts or images, using dual fine-tuned diffusion models to separately model the face and body, a pose-consistent constraint for better personalization, and a multi-resolution strategy for stable and detailed generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary comparison of this paper to other related research on 3D avatar generation:- This paper proposes a new framework (AvatarBooth) for generating 3D human avatars from text prompts and/or images. It builds on recent work using implicit neural representations and score/knowledge distillation from pre-trained generative models.- A key contribution is the use of dual fine-tuned diffusion models to separately supervise the face and body generation, allowing for more detailed and customized facial appearance. This is a novel approach compared to prior avatar generation works.- The introduction of a pose-consistent constraint during diffusion model fine-tuning is also a new technique to improve multi-view consistency for avatar appearance and geometry. This addresses an issue with overfitting to camera views in prior methods.- The multi-resolution score distillation sampling provides a more stable and higher quality training process than fixed high-resolution approaches in past work.- Compared to AvatarCLIP and AvatarCraft which rely heavily on SMPL constraints, this method can generate more varied and detailed avatar geometry and appearance by better utilizing vision-language priors.- It generates more detailed facial geometry and appearance than DreamAvatar which uses a latent NeRF representation. The avatar is also articulated unlike DreamAvatar.- Unlike DreamBooth3D which struggled with identity consistency, this work achieves better personalization and faithfulness to input images through the proposed fine-tuning techniques.In summary, AvatarBooth advances the state-of-the-art in controllable and customizable 3D avatar generation by introducing novel strategies for diffusion model fine-tuning, multi-resolution supervision, and separate face/body modeling. The results demonstrate improved quality, detail, and personalization over previous approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the accuracy and detail of the generated avatar models. The authors state that the fidelity of the synthesized models still has room for improvement. Developing techniques to produce even higher quality and more detailed geometry and appearance could be an area for future work.- Increasing the speed and efficiency of the model training and fine-tuning process. The authors note that reducing the time needed for fine-tuning the diffusion models and training the neural implicit surface would be beneficial. Exploring methods to accelerate these steps could help improve the practicality of the approach.- Incorporating 3D human datasets into the training process. While the current method relies solely on 2D data, the authors suggest that leveraging existing 3D human datasets could help improve the avatar generation, even if those datasets are limited in size. Combining 3D priors with the current 2D supervision could be impactful.- Expanding the controllable attributes and editable features. While the current method allows control via text prompts and input images, expanding the range of attributes that can be tuned and edited would be useful, such as more granular control over clothing, hair, accessories, etc.- Testing the approach on more varied data. The authors present results on human avatar generation, but exploring the method for other animate and inanimate objects could be interesting future work.- Deploying the avatar generation system in real applications. Evaluating the method as part of an end-to-end system for tasks like virtual reality, digital humans, or gaming could demonstrate its real-world usefulness.In summary, the core future directions pointed out by the authors involve improving avatar quality and detail, speeding up the system, incorporating more data, expanding controllability, and applying the technique to real-world applications. Advancing research in these areas could help build on the contributions made in this paper.
