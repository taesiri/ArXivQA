# [AvatarBooth: High-Quality and Customizable 3D Human Avatar Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09864)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goals and hypotheses of this paper are:- To develop a novel method for generating high-quality, customizable 3D human avatars from text prompts and/or images. The central hypothesis is that using dual fine-tuned diffusion models for the face and body along with other techniques will allow higher quality avatar generation compared to previous approaches.- To enable identity-customized avatar generation from arbitrary input images while still supporting text-based editing. The hypothesis is that fine-tuning diffusion models on personal photos along with introducing pose-consistent constraints will transfer facial and body appearance details to the generated avatar. - To achieve detailed 3D avatar generation through a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy. The hypothesis is that a multi-resolution score distillation scheme will improve rendering quality and robustness compared to fixed-resolution supervision.- To demonstrate that the proposed techniques of dual model fine-tuning, pose-consistent constraints, and multi-resolution score distillation allow higher quality and more customizable avatar generation compared to prior arts. The hypothesis is that the avatars generated by the proposed AvatarBooth framework will be more realistic, detailed, and controllable.In summary, the central goal is generating customizable, high-fidelity 3D avatars using diffusion model guidance and image/text inputs. The key hypotheses are around the benefits of the proposed model fine-tuning strategies, constraints, and multi-resolution supervision in achieving improved avatar quality and control compared to previous state-of-the-art.
