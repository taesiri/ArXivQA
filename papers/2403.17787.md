# [Evaluating the Efficacy of Prompt-Engineered Large Multimodal Models   Versus Fine-Tuned Vision Transformers in Image-Based Security Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17787)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the applicability and effectiveness of prompt-engineered Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) such as Gemini-pro versus fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) models for critical security challenges. It focuses on two distinct tasks - a visually evident task of detecting adversarial triggers in images that could compromise machine learning models, and a non-visually evident task of malware classification through visual representations of files.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper conducts a comparative analysis using prompt engineering strategies to guide the LMM's analysis, and fine-tuning techniques to specialize the ViT models. For the trigger detection task, the MNIST dataset augmented with adversarial triggers is used. For malware classification, the MaleVis dataset containing visual representations of malware samples categorized into classes and families is utilized.

Key Findings:
- For trigger detection, fine-tuned ViTs achieve 100% accuracy in identifying triggers while peak accuracy for prompt-engineered LMM is only 77.2%, highlighting limitations in recognizing simple adversarial patterns consistently.  

- For malware classification, fine-tuned ViTs demonstrate superior performance with over 97% accuracy, whereas prompt-engineered LMM struggles significantly, with best accuracy of only 21.2%. This highlights challenges in applying LMMs for tasks requiring deep visual pattern analysis.

- Results indicate viability limitations of prompt-engineered LMMs in specialized applications like cybersecurity compared to fine-tuned ViT models which display unmatched efficacy.

Main Contributions:
- Unique comparative analysis between prompt-engineered LMMs and fine-tuned ViTs
- Demonstrating limitations of LMMs in critical security applications 
- Showcasing strengths and reliability of fine-tuned ViTs across spectrum of security tasks
- Informing decisions regarding adoption of these models in security contexts

The paper provides novel insights into the applicability of LMMs versus fine-tuned vision models for security challenges. While LMMs are more accessible, their effectiveness is limited compared to specialized fine-tuned models for intricate tasks requiring detailed visual analysis.
