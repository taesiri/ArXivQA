# [Label-efficient Training of Small Task-specific Models by Leveraging   Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18237)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach, called task-oriented knowledge transfer, to train small task-specific models by transferring knowledge from large vision foundation models (VFMs). The key idea is to first teach the target task to the VFM using labeled data from that task, then transfer task-oriented knowledge from the finetuned VFM to the small target model using a large unlabeled dataset, and finally finetune the target model on the labeled target task data. Experiments on image classification and segmentation tasks with limited labeled data show this approach outperforms task-agnostic VFM distillation, web-scale CLIP pretraining, and ImageNet pretraining by 1-22%. The results demonstrate the importance of using a task-relevant transfer set, and propose an image retrieval method to curate effective transfer sets when unlabeled data from the target domain is unavailable. The approach enables training high-quality mobile task-specific models by effectively utilizing the knowledge stored in large VFMs. Key advantages are better performance compared to alternatives and flexibility to customize models for specialized tasks using limited labeled data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a task-oriented knowledge transfer approach to effectively train small task-specific models by first finetuning a vision foundation model on the target task and then distilling its task predictions to the small model on an appropriate unlabeled transfer set.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet highly effective task-oriented knowledge transfer approach for training small task-specific models by transferring knowledge from large vision foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, the key aspects of their approach are:

1) First teaching the target task to the VFM by finetuning it using labeled target task data. 

2) Then transferring task-oriented knowledge from the finetuned VFM to the small target model using distillation on a large unlabeled dataset (transfer set). 

3) Finally, finetuning the target model on the labeled target task data.

Through experiments on multiple target tasks, they show that their proposed task-oriented knowledge transfer approach outperforms alternative approaches like task-agnostic VFM distillation, web-scale CLIP pretraining of target model, and standard supervised ImageNet pretraining. They also highlight the importance of using a transfer set that is related to the target task distribution.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective methodology to leverage knowledge from large VFMs to train high-quality small task-specific models under limited labeled data regimes for new target tasks.

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) - Large pretrained models like DINO and CLIP that serve as a foundation for many computer vision tasks.

- Task-oriented knowledge transfer - The proposed approach to transfer knowledge from a VFM to a small target model by first finetuning the VFM on the target task and then distilling knowledge to the small model. 

- Task-agnostic knowledge transfer - An alternative approach involving distilling a frozen VFM to the small target model.

- Transfer set - The large unlabeled dataset used in the knowledge transfer process.

- Image retrieval - Proposed strategy to curate a task-related transfer set when one is not readily available.

- Limited labeled data - A key setting this work focuses on - utilizing VFMs to train small models when labeled target task data is scarce.

- Target models - The small efficient models like MobileViT and FastViT that are trained to specialize on a target task.

So in summary, key terms revolve around leveraging vision foundation models to train specialized small models for target tasks under limited labeled data regimes.
