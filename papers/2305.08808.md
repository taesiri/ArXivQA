# [GeoMAE: Masked Geometric Target Prediction for Self-supervised Point   Cloud Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08808)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper tries to address is: 

What are good self-supervised learning objectives for point cloud representation learning?

In particular, the authors identify that simply adopting masked autoencoder (MAE) objectives like predicting raw point coordinates is ineffective for point clouds. Instead, they propose novel objectives tailored for point clouds - predicting centroid, occupancy, surface normal and curvature. These geometry-aware objectives enable more effective self-supervised representation learning on point clouds.

The key hypothesis is that leveraging geometric properties of point clouds as self-supervised objectives will lead to better feature learning, as geometry provides strong cues about objects and scenes. The experiments validate this hypothesis, showing their proposed GeoMAE method outperforms previous self-supervised approaches on various downstream tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces geometry-aware self-supervised objectives for point clouds to enable more effective representation learning without annotations, by leveraging geometric properties like centroid, occupancy, surface normal and curvature as pretext tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes geometry aware self-supervised objectives for point cloud pre-training. Previous methods like Point-MAE simply predict point coordinates or occupancy from masked point clouds. This paper identifies limitations of such objectives and designs new pretext tasks leveraging point statistics (centroid, occupancy) and surface properties (normal, curvature) to enable more effective representation learning. 

2. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks including 3D object detection, segmentation, and tracking compared to previous self-supervised methods. For example, it improves nuScenes 3D detection AP by 3.38 over training from scratch.

3. It provides comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components and objectives in the proposed approach. The results justify design choices like using separate decoders and predicting both point statistics and surface properties.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing dedicated pretext tasks for point clouds by leveraging geometric properties. This leads to better self-supervised representation learning for point clouds and significant improvements on downstream tasks. The paper focuses on both introducing new techniques tailored for point cloud geometry and empirically demonstrating their effectiveness.
