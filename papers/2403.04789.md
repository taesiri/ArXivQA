# [TopicDiff: A Topic-enriched Diffusion Approach for Multimodal   Conversational Emotion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04789)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal Conversational Emotion (MCE) detection aims to detect emotions in utterances within conversations spanning across acoustic, vision and language modalities. 
- Existing works focus on modeling contextual information in conversations but ignore the multimodal topic information, which can provide useful global clues about emotions.  
- Traditional neural topic models suffer from diversity deficiency in capturing multimodal topic information.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a model-agnostic Topic-enriched Diffusion (TopicDiff) approach to capture multimodal topic information for boosting MCE performance.
- Integrate diffusion model into neural topic model to mitigate diversity deficiency and sufficiently capture multimodal topics.
- Use three TopicDiff modules to capture acoustic, vision and language topic information separately.
- Jointly train TopicDiff modules with MCE models under multi-task learning framework.

Main Contributions:
- First work to consider multimodal topic information for conversational emotion detection. 
- Propose TopicDiff approach to capture multimodal topic information by integrating diffusion model into neural topic model.
- Achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art MCE baselines on both topic-density and topic-sparsity datasets.
- Discover acoustic and vision topic information is more discriminative and robust than language through analysis.
- TopicDiff is model-agnostic and can be easily extended to other MCE models.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel TopicDiff approach to incorporate multimodal topic information for boosting emotion detection in conversations by leveraging diffusion model to capture topics. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness.
