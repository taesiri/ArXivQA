# [A Large Language Model Enhanced Sequential Recommender for Joint Video   and Comment Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing video recommender systems mainly model users' interactions with videos, lacking consideration of comments. However, reading/writing comments has become an essential part of the video watching experience. This paper aims to leverage both video and comment data to improve recommendation quality and user engagement on online video platforms.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel framework called LSVCR that jointly conducts personalized video and comment recommendation by modeling user interactions with both videos and comments. 

The key components of LSVCR are:
1) Sequential recommendation (SR) model: Serves as the primary recommendation backbone to achieve efficient user preference modeling.
2) Supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender: Used to enhance the preference semantics captured by the SR model. The LLM's semantic understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities are leveraged to reason about underlying user preferences. This component is only used during training and discarded during deployment due to efficiency concerns.

A two-stage training paradigm is designed to integrate the merits of the above two components:
1) Personalized preference alignment stage: The video/comment recommendation tasks are jointly learned while aligning the preference representations from the SR model and LLM recommender via contrastive learning. This enhances the semantics of the SR model.
2) Recommendation-oriented fine-tuning stage: The alignment-enhanced SR model is fine-tuned on specific recommendation tasks to further improve performance. The supplemental LLM recommender is discarded.

Main Contributions:
1) A novel framework LSVCR that conducts joint personalized video and comment recommendation by modeling heterogeneous user interaction behaviors.
2) An approach to enhance the semantics of the sequential recommendation model using a supplemental LLM recommender via personalized preference alignment.
3) A two-stage training paradigm that integrates the merits of the sequential model and LLM recommender.
4) Demonstrated effectiveness of LSVCR over competitive baselines on video/comment recommendation and actual performance gains from online A/B testing.
