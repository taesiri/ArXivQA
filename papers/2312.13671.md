# [Text2Analysis: A Benchmark of Table Question Answering with Advanced   Data Analysis and Unclear Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing tabular data analysis research (e.g. Text2SQL, TableQA) focuses mainly on basic SQL-like operations and lacks coverage of advanced analysis tasks like forecasting, chart generation, and basic insights that require more in-depth reasoning. 
- Real-world queries are often unclear with missing parameters, but current research pays little attention to modeling such unclear queries.

Proposed Solution - Text2Analysis Benchmark:
- Incorporates advanced analysis tasks beyond basic SQL operations like forecasting, chart generation, computing insights.
- Includes unclear queries with missing parameters to better resemble real situations.  
- Proposes 5 effective annotation methods utilizing LLMs to obtain high quality (table, query, code, result) quadruples.
- Provides a diverse, reliable benchmark with 2249 samples over 347 tables for evaluating analytical abilities.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies and addresses research gaps in advanced analysis tasks and unclear queries for tabular data.
- Text2Analysis benchmark enables more comprehensive evaluation of analytical capabilities of models.
- Proposed annotation methods efficiently leverage LLMs to create reliable, diverse samples.
- Analysis of several SOTA models reveals strengths and weaknesses in tackling the benchmark, guiding future work.

In summary, the paper introduces the Text2Analysis benchmark containing advanced analysis tasks and unclear queries to promote more inclusive tabular reasoning research towards real-world complex analysis needs. The benchmark and annotation methods aim to facilitate developing models with better analytical capabilities. Experiments indicate existing challenges that models still need to address in order handle advanced tasks and unclear queries.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes 5 innovative annotation methods for constructing the NL2Code dataset. Can you explain in more detail how large language models are utilized in each method to accelerate and expand the annotation process? 

2. When expanding queries by removing parameters to make them unclear, what techniques are used to generate appropriate recommended code and result lists? How is the quality of the recommendations ensured?

3. For the forward annotation method, can you elaborate on how the initial code generation tool and automatic debugging tool work? What models are used and how are they tuned to output high-quality initial code?  

4. When performing annotation quality assurance through iterative annotation and refinement, what specific steps are taken in each iteration? How many iterations on average were required before moving to human evaluation?

5. What considerations went into the design of the standardized output format for code results? Why is it important to handle cases like single-value DataFrames and lists in a standardized way?

6. The paper uses both regression metrics and a pass rate metric for evaluating forecasting code quality. What are the relative advantages and limitations of each approach? When would you choose one vs the other?

7. For the task taxonomy, what criteria were used to determine which advanced analysis tasks to include from each analytics category (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive)? 

8. How were the parameters chosen to be omitted in the taxonomy of unclear queries? What challenges emerge when trying to generate queries with missing parameters?

9. Could the annotation methods proposed be applied to other NL2Code problem domains beyond tabular data analysis? What adaptations would need to be made?

10. The results show limitations of current models on advanced analysis tasks. What specific capabilities need improvement for models to better tackle forecasting tasks and unclear queries?
