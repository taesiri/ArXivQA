# [SimPB: A Single Model for 2D and 3D Object Detection from Multiple   Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most current multi-view 3D object detection methods either directly predict 3D boxes in bird's eye view (BEV) space or utilize separate 2D detectors to enhance 3D detection performance. However, these approaches have limitations: 1) Separate 2D and 3D detectors operate in a two-stage manner with only one-time interaction, underutilizing 2D features for 3D tasks; 2) Using different detector architectures for 2D and 3D tasks poses optimization challenges. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes SimPB, a single and unified detector that simultaneously predicts 2D boxes in perspective view and 3D boxes in BEV using multiple camera inputs. The key components are:

1) A hybrid decoder with interleaved multi-view 2D decoder layers and 3D decoder layers specifically designed for 2D and 3D detection respectively.

2) A Dynamic Query Allocation module that assigns 3D queries to images and forms 2D queries based on camera parameters. 

3) An Adaptive Query Aggregation module that fuses 2D queries to update 3D queries continuously.

Together with Query-Group Attention, SimPB interactively refines 2D and 3D tasks in a cyclic 3D-2D-3D manner within the hybrid decoder, achieving simultaneous optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first unified single architecture for simultaneous multi-view 2D and 3D detection
- Introduces a hybrid decoder specifically tailored for 2D and 3D tasks
- Achieves continuous refinement between 2D and 3D tasks through dynamic allocation, adaptive aggregation and cyclic interaction
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset for both 2D and 3D detection

The key novelty is the simultaneous optimization of 2D and 3D detection in a single network through purpose-built components for cyclic interaction and attention-based information exchange. By tightly coupling 2D and 3D detection, SimPB fully utilizes their synergies.
