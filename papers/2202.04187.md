# [FMP: Toward Fair Graph Message Passing against Topology Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node representations by aggregating features from neighboring nodes. However, this aggregation process accumulates bias in the representations due to topology bias induced by the graph structure. 
- Specifically, nodes with the same sensitive attributes tend to connect more in real graphs (high sensitive homophily). During aggregation, representations of nodes with the same sensitive attributes become more similar, leading to representation bias.  
- Prior work on fair GNNs focuses on regularization or adversarial approaches but does not address the fundamental issue of how message passing induces bias. Hence, the effect of message passing schemes themselves on fairness is not well understood.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first theoretically proves that message passing in GNNs enhances representation bias when there is high sensitive homophily in the graph topology. 
- Motivated by this analysis, the paper proposes a Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme that aggregates useful neighborhood information while debiasing representations. 
- FMP formulates an optimization problem with two objectives: (1) graph smoothness to aggregate useful signals (2) fairness to mitigate bias. It solves this problem efficiently using Fenchel conjugate.
- The resulting algorithm has two intuitive phases - propagation + bias mitigation. Bias mitigation introduces low-rank perturbations in probability space to debias while maintaining performance.
- An acceleration method is proposed to reduce computational complexity of gradients.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to formally analyze how message passing in GNNs introduces bias due to topology bias and sensitve homophily.
- Proposes transparent and efficient FMP scheme integrated within message passing that achieves smoothness and fairness objectives. 
- Extensive analysis of fairness-performance trade-off compared to regularization and adversarial approaches.
- Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate FMP mitigates bias effectively with marginal computational overhead.

In summary, the paper provides both theoretical and algorithmic insights into how message passing affects fairness in GNNs, and develops an efficient debiasing scheme within the message passing framework.
