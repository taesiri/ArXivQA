# [FMP: Toward Fair Graph Message Passing against Topology Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node representations by aggregating features from neighboring nodes. However, this aggregation process accumulates bias in the representations due to topology bias induced by the graph structure. 
- Specifically, nodes with the same sensitive attributes tend to connect more in real graphs (high sensitive homophily). During aggregation, representations of nodes with the same sensitive attributes become more similar, leading to representation bias.  
- Prior work on fair GNNs focuses on regularization or adversarial approaches but does not address the fundamental issue of how message passing induces bias. Hence, the effect of message passing schemes themselves on fairness is not well understood.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first theoretically proves that message passing in GNNs enhances representation bias when there is high sensitive homophily in the graph topology. 
- Motivated by this analysis, the paper proposes a Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme that aggregates useful neighborhood information while debiasing representations. 
- FMP formulates an optimization problem with two objectives: (1) graph smoothness to aggregate useful signals (2) fairness to mitigate bias. It solves this problem efficiently using Fenchel conjugate.
- The resulting algorithm has two intuitive phases - propagation + bias mitigation. Bias mitigation introduces low-rank perturbations in probability space to debias while maintaining performance.
- An acceleration method is proposed to reduce computational complexity of gradients.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to formally analyze how message passing in GNNs introduces bias due to topology bias and sensitve homophily.
- Proposes transparent and efficient FMP scheme integrated within message passing that achieves smoothness and fairness objectives. 
- Extensive analysis of fairness-performance trade-off compared to regularization and adversarial approaches.
- Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate FMP mitigates bias effectively with marginal computational overhead.

In summary, the paper provides both theoretical and algorithmic insights into how message passing affects fairness in GNNs, and develops an efficient debiasing scheme within the message passing framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a fair message passing scheme called FMP that aggregates useful neighbor information while minimizing topology bias to achieve node representations that are both smooth over the graph and fair with respect to sensitive attributes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It is the first paper to theoretically investigate how GCN-like message passing schemes amplify representation bias according to topology bias.

2) It develops an effective, efficient, and transparent scheme called Fair Message Passing (FMP) for GNNs to simultaneously guarantee graph smoothness and enhance fairness. This lays a foundation for intrinsic methods on exploring fair GNNs. An acceleration method is also proposed to reduce the gradient computation complexity.

3) It experimentally evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed FMP on three real-world datasets. The results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, FMP achieves a superior trade-off between prediction performance and fairness with negligible computation overhead.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the FMP scheme along with theoretical analysis and experimental validation to mitigate representation bias and enhance fairness in graph neural networks.

To summarize, this paper proposes a new message passing scheme called Fair Message Passing (FMP) to aggregate useful neighbor information while debiasing representation bias in GNNs. It introduces the concept of topology bias arising from high sensitive homophily in many real-world graphs. The paper formulates an optimization framework with fairness and prediction performance objectives, and derives an efficient algorithm to solve it. Experiments demonstrate that FMP mitigates bias effectively on node classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Key concepts involve graph representation learning, bias quantification, and algorithm design for fair and accurate models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new message passing scheme called Fair Message Passing (FMP). What is the key intuition behind designing this new scheme? How is it different from standard message passing in GNNs?

2. One of the key claims is that standard message passing in GNNs can amplify representation bias due to topology bias. Can you explain the theoretical analysis behind this claim and how the topology characteristics like node number, edge density etc. influence this?

3. The paper formulates an optimization problem combining both graph smoothness and fairness objectives. Explain the rationale behind each of these terms and how they help in debiasing. 

4. The FMP scheme has two main components - propagation with skip connections and bias mitigation. Can you explain the purpose of each component and how they operate? 

5. The dual variables in FMP indicate the perturbation direction in probability space. Explain this statement. Also explain how the projection onto l_inf ball helps in debiasing.

6. How is the gradient computation with respect to node features done efficiently in FMP using the properties of softmax? What is the time complexity of gradient computation?

7. The paper claims FMP is transparent and interpretable. Justify this claim by explaining how the debiasing can be explained intuitively. 

8. The synthetic experiments seem to validate the theoretical claims on bias amplification w.r.t topology characteristics. Critically analyze the experimental results. Are there any limitations?

9. For the real-world experiments, FMP shows better trade-off between accuracy and fairness compared to baselines. But are there scenarios where FMP underperforms? Identify conditions under which it may not work well.  

10. The paper focuses on debiasing node representations. How can the ideas proposed here be extended for other graph based tasks such as link prediction or graph classification? Identify methodology gaps and propose ideas.
