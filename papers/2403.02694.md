# [Privacy-Aware Semantic Cache for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are revolutionizing search and conversational AI, but they are computationally expensive. Users often submit repeated queries to services, so caching responses can reduce costs. However, existing caches rely on keyword matching and fail to capture semantic similarity in queries, leading to poor cache hit rates. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric, privacy-preserving semantic cache for LLM services. It uses federated learning to train an embedding model on user devices without storing data centrally. This allows learning query patterns for each user. It generates embeddings for queries, uses cosine similarity to match new queries to cached ones, and returns cached responses to avoid querying LLMs. It compresses embeddings with PCA to reduce storage needs and optimize search time. It also automatically tunes the similarity threshold per user for accuracy.

Contributions:
- First semantic cache using federated learning to enable privacy-preserving embedding model training customized to each user's query behavior
- 83% lower storage needs and 11% faster query search time via embedding compression, while improving cache hit rate over baseline
- 17% higher F1 Score and 20% better precision than existing semantic cache by auto-tuning similarity threshold 

In summary, MeanCache introduces an innovative decentralized design that reduces costs for LLM services, minimizes false cache hits to improve user experience, and eliminates privacy risks - all while surpassing performance of current semantic caches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache that leverages federated learning to train a query embedding model on distributed user data, matches semantically similar queries to cache responses locally, thereby avoiding redundant large language model requests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of MeanCache, a novel user-centric semantic caching system for large language model (LLM) based web services. Specifically:

1) MeanCache utilizes federated learning to train an embedding model across clients in a privacy-preserving manner, leveraging users' private data to enhance model quality without violating privacy. 

2) It employs a smaller transformer model, MPNet, to efficiently generate query embeddings on the client side.

3) It introduces optimizations like embedding compression using PCA to reduce storage demands and accelerate semantic search.  

4) It automatically finds the optimal cosine similarity threshold from user data to minimize false cache hits and misses.

5) Evaluations show MeanCache achieves higher precision and F1 score compared to existing semantic caches like GPTCache, while also preserving privacy, reducing costs and latency for users.

In summary, MeanCache contributes a novel client-side, privacy-aware semantic cache that utilizes federated learning to effectively serve repeated user queries to LLM services from a local cache, avoiding redundant requests and reducing associated computing costs.

The paper introduces "MeanCache", a semantic cache system for large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. It leverages federated learning to train a query embedding model across clients in a privacy-preserving manner. It then uses cosine similarity of query embeddings to identify duplicate queries and serve responses from a local cache, avoiding unnecessary calls to the LLM. Key goals are minimizing false hits, compression of embeddings, and optimizing cache performance, while preserving user privacy.
