# [TAMS: Translation-Assisted Morphological Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Canonical morphological segmentation is the task of breaking down words into their underlying morphemes. This is useful for linguistic analysis and documentation, but requires annotated data which is scarce in low-resource languages.
- Translation data tends to be more abundant than segmented data for low-resource languages. This paper investigates whether translation data can be leveraged to improve canonical segmentation when training data is limited.

Method: 
- Propose a character-level sequence-to-sequence model with a pointer-generator LSTM architecture for canonical segmentation. 
- Incorporate representations of English translations obtained from BERT into the model. Specifically, embed the English translations, average embeddings of aligned words, and incorporate as additional input in encoder and/or decoder.
- Experiment with different strategies for producing a fixed length translation representation and integrating it into the model.

Experiments:
- Use Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) data with translations for 3 languages - Tsez, Lezgi, Arapaho.
- Tune model hyperparameters and translation incorporation strategies on Tsez development set.
- Evaluate with both automatic alignments (awesome-align) and manual alignments.
- Test final model ("TAMS") on all 3 languages with varying training set sizes.

Results:
- TAMS outperforms baseline by 2.33% on average in extremely low resource setting (n=100 training samples). Up to 3.88% improvement for Lezgi.
- Also consistent gains for polysynthetic language Arapaho.
- Mixed results in higher resource settings. Translations more useful in lower data scenarios.
- Automatic alignments achieve comparable performance to manual alignments.

Contributions:
- Novel method to incorporate translation representations into sequence-to-sequence canonical segmentation model.
- Demonstrates translations can improve segmentation accuracy in very low-resource scenarios, even with automatic alignments. 
- Provides insights on most effective strategies to leverage translations in morphological segmentation.
