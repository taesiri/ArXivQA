# [Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aggregation for Skeleton-Aware Sign Language   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current skeleton-aware sign language recognition (SLR) methods have two main limitations:
  1) Spatial modules rely on fixed graph structures which cannot fully capture dynamic joint relationships.
  2) Temporal modules use simple convolutions which cannot model complex human movements.

Proposed Solution:
- Enhance flexibility of spatial modules:
  - Introduce graph correlation module to dynamically build input-specific spatial graphs.
  - Add virtual super nodes to incorporate domain knowledge.
  - Distinguish important joints using an adaptive aggregation graph.
- Capture complex temporal patterns: 
  - Propose parallel temporal convolutional module with multiple branches of varied receptive fields.

Main Contributions:
- Graph correlation module to compute channel-wise dynamic graphs without predefined structure.
- Super node transform module to absorb useful domain knowledge from virtual nodes. 
- Dynamic graph aggregation module to identify key joint connections.
- Parallel multi-scale temporal convolutions to represent intricate movements.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale SLR datasets.
- Outperforms RGB-based methods in most cases with better efficiency.
- Comprehensive ablation study verifies the efficacy of each proposed component.

In summary, this paper introduces novel spatial and temporal modeling techniques for skeleton-based sign language recognition. By dynamically constructing joint relationships and capturing complex temporal patterns, the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to previous RGB and skeleton-based approaches.
