# [Projected Generative Diffusion Models for Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generative diffusion models like DDPMs and score-based models excel at creating realistic and coherent synthetic data. However, they struggle to ensure the outputs adhere precisely to predefined specifications, constraints, or physical principles. This limits their applicability in domains like engineering, science, and automation that require strict feasibility guarantees. For example, in physics-based simulations or engineering design, outputs must abide by governing laws and meet safety thresholds.

Proposed Solution - Projected Generative Diffusion Models (PGDM):
The paper proposes recasting the sampling process of generative diffusion as a constrained optimization problem that can be solved via repeated projections. Specifically, they formulate the diffusion sampling to maximize the data density while imposing constraints that the outputs must satisfy. This constrained optimization is solved by taking projected gradient steps - after each step optimizing the data density objective, a projection operator snaps the sample to the nearest feasible point satisfying the constraints. 

By incorporating constraints throughout the sampling process, PGDM steers the generation towards the constrained sub-distribution. Theoretical analysis shows, under convexity assumptions, the projections provide better constraint adherence than unconditional sampling. Empirically, the method ensures convergence to precise feasibility even under non-convex constraints.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates diffusion sampling as a constrained optimization amendable to projected gradient methods
- Provides theoretical analysis explaining improved constraint satisfaction under PGDM
- Demonstrates exact constraint adherence under complex non-convex constraints for physics-informed video generation, trajectory optimization, and material generation
- Maintains sample quality: generates constrained outputs with FID scores competitive to state-of-the-art conditional diffusion models  
- Applicable even when training data distribution does not satisfy constraints, and for out-of-distribution constraint specifications

In summary, PGDM enables precise and reliable enforcement of constraints in generative diffusion models, expanding their applicability for scientific and engineering use cases demanding strict feasibility guarantees.
