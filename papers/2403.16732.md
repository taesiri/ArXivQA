# [Enabling Uncertainty Estimation in Iterative Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Iterative neural networks, where the network recursively uses its own predictions as inputs to refine the predictions, have been shown to boost performance. However, they do not provide any estimate of the uncertainty or reliability of their predictions.
- Existing uncertainty estimation methods like ensembles and MC-dropout have downsides - ensembles are computationally expensive, MC-dropout produces lower quality uncertainty estimates.

Proposed Solution:
- Key insight: the rate of convergence of the iterative predictions is indicative of the prediction certainty. Rapid convergence typically indicates an accurate prediction. Slow or erratic convergence indicates higher uncertainty.
- Propose using the variance of iterative predictions from an iterative network as a proxy for uncertainty. Higher variance corresponds to slower convergence and higher uncertainty.
- This approach requires no modifications to the original iterative architecture, adds no computational overhead, and provides high quality uncertainty estimates rivaling ensembles.

Contributions:
- Introduce an effective uncertainty estimation approach tailored for iterative neural networks, relying solely on consistency of iterative predictions.
- Demonstrate the approach for uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution detection on road delineation from aerial images. The approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods like ensembles and MC-dropout.
- Show the uncertainty estimates can be leveraged for Bayesian Optimization of 2D airfoil and 3D car shapes for drag optimization. The approach outperforms common baselines.
- Provide extensive analysis and experiments highlighting properties of iterative predictions and their correlation with accuracy across tasks.
