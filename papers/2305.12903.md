# [DiffAVA: Personalized Text-to-Audio Generation with Visual Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper abstract:

Problem:
- Text-to-audio (TTA) generation aims to synthesize audio from text descriptions.
- Previous TTA methods used latent diffusion models to learn audio embeddings conditioned on text embeddings. 
- However, they ignored synchronization between audio and visual content in videos, often generating audio that mismatches the video frames.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DiffAVA, a novel personalized text-to-sound generation approach with visual alignment based on latent diffusion models.
- DiffAVA fine-tunes lightweight visual-text alignment modules with frozen modality-specific encoders to update visual-aligned text embeddings as the diffusion condition.

- Specifically, DiffAVA uses:
  - A multi-head attention transformer to aggregate temporal information from video features.
  - A dual multi-modal residual network to fuse temporal visual representations with text embeddings.

- A contrastive learning objective matches the visual-aligned text embeddings with audio features.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel approach to text-to-audio generation that aligns the generated audio with visual content in videos.
- Achieves this via fine-tuning alignment modules rather than re-training full models.
- Demonstrates competitive performance in aligning generated audio to visual content on the AudioCaps dataset.

In summary, the key innovation is generating text-to-audio that synchronizes with video content by fine-tuning lightweight alignment modules, instead of re-training entire models. Experiments show this approach can effectively match audio to visuals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel text-to-sound generation approach called DiffAVA that aligns generated audio with video content by fusing textual and visual representations in a latent diffusion model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel text-to-sound generation approach called DiffAVA that can generate audio aligned with visual content in videos. Specifically:

- DiffAVA uses latent diffusion models to generate audio conditioned on text descriptions. 

- It incorporates visual information from video frames to align the generated audio with the visual content, avoiding audio-visual mismatches.

- It includes lightweight visual-text alignment modules that can be simply fine-tuned on top of frozen modality-specific encoders. These alignment modules update the text embeddings to be visual-aligned before using them to condition the audio generation.

- The model is trained with a contrastive learning objective that matches the visual-aligned text embeddings with audio features.

- Experiments on the AudioCaps dataset show DiffAVA can generate visual-aligned audio competitively.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DiffAVA, a novel latent diffusion model for text-to-audio generation that can align the synthesized audio with visual content in videos through visual-text alignment modules.
