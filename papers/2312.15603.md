# [A Split-and-Privatize Framework for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15603)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Split-and-Privatize Framework for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning":

Problem:
- Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on private downstream data is important for adaptation, but raises privacy concerns. 
- In the model-as-a-service setting, the vendor cannot share the full PLM with the customer due to confidentiality, and the customer cannot share private data with the vendor. This hinders privacy-conscious users from using the PLM customization service.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Split-and-Privatize (SAP) federated learning framework to enable privacy-preserving PLM fine-tuning.
- The key ideas are:
   - Split PLM into a top model (vendor) and bottom model (customer) to protect model privacy.
   - Customer privatizes text representations before sending to vendor to protect data privacy.
- Flexible framework combining model split with differential privacy or other privacy techniques.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the problem of privacy-preserving PLM fine-tuning in model-as-a-service settings.
- Proposes the SAP framework that protects both model privacy and data privacy.
- Introduces a Contributing-Token-Identification method to improve utility-privacy tradeoff.
- Comprehensively evaluates SAP on multiple NLP datasets and tasks. Shows SAP achieves good balance between utility and privacy.
- Demonstrates SAP is a flexible framework that can adapt to different application scenarios by adjusting model split and privacy settings.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in enabling practical privacy-preserving PLM customization services to facilitate the adoption of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning framework called Split-and-Privatize (SAP) which splits a pre-trained language model into a top model on the vendor and a bottom model on the customer, applies text privatization techniques to perturb representations transmitted by the customer, and thereby achieves a balance between protecting model privacy and data privacy while maintaining competitive performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning framework called Split-and-Privatize (SAP) for large language model customization. Specifically, the SAP framework has the following key features:

1) It splits the pre-trained language model into a top model deployed on the vendor side and a bottom model deployed on the customer side to protect the model privacy. 

2) It applies text privatization techniques (e.g. differential privacy) on the customer side to perturb the text representations before sending to the vendor, in order to protect the data privacy.

3) It provides flexibility to adapt the framework to different scenarios by choosing different options for the split position and whether the bottom model is frozen or trainable. 

4) It proposes a contributing token identification method to improve the utility-privacy tradeoff by reducing the noise added to tokens that contribute highly to the target utility.

In summary, the SAP framework serves as a comprehensive solution that simultaneously protects the vendor's model privacy and the customer's data privacy in language model customization services, while maintaining good performance on downstream tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper are:

- Fine-tuning - The paper focuses on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt them to downstream tasks.

- Privacy preservation - The paper proposes methods to preserve both model privacy and data privacy during LLM fine-tuning.

- Model-as-a-service (MaaS) - The paper considers an emerging service form where vendors provide pre-trained LLMs and resources for customers to customize models based on their private data.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) - The paper discusses existing methods like adapter-based tuning and prompt-based tuning that only update a small subset of parameters to reduce computation costs.

- Split learning - The proposed framework is based on the split learning architecture where the model is divided between two parties to enable collaborative training without sharing raw private data. 

- Text privatization - The customer applies privacy mechanisms like differential privacy to perturb text representations before sending them to vendor to protect data privacy.

- Utility-privacy trade-off - The framework needs to balance between preserving privacy and maintaining model utility on downstream tasks.

- Contributing token identification (CTI) - A method proposed to improve the utility-privacy trade-off by reducing perturbations to tokens critical for model performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Split-and-Privatize (SAP) framework. What are the key components of this framework and how do they work together to achieve privacy preservation during language model fine-tuning?

2. How does the proposed Contributing Token Identification (CTI) method help improve the utility-privacy trade-off? Explain the rationale behind identifying contributing tokens and reducing perturbations on them.  

3. What are the advantages and limitations of using differential privacy techniques like $d\chi$-privacy for text privatization in the SAP framework?

4. How does making the bottom model in SAP trainable impact empirical privacy against embedding inversion attacks? Explain why joint training weakens privacy guarantees.

5. The split position of the pre-trained language model is an important architectural choice in SAP. Analyze the impact of split position on model utility, data privacy and computation overhead.

6. Compare and contrast the proposed SAP framework with existing privacy-preserving language model customization methods like offsite tuning. What threat models do they consider and what are their strengths and weaknesses? 

7. The paper assumes an honest-but-curious threat model. Discuss the challenges in preventing outright adversarial attacks on the SAP framework and potential defenses.  

8. What auxiliary techniques like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation can be integrated with SAP to further strengthen privacy guarantees? Explain feasibility and overhead concerns.

9. Critically analyze the privacy attacks conducted in the paper to evaluate SAP. What other advanced inference attacks should be considered and how can the framework be enhanced to defend against them?

10. The utility tasks experimented on are limited to classification problems. How can the proposed techniques be extended to other language tasks like text generation while preserving privacy? Identify key challenges.
