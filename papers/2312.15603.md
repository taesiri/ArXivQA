# [A Split-and-Privatize Framework for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15603)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Split-and-Privatize Framework for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning":

Problem:
- Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on private downstream data is important for adaptation, but raises privacy concerns. 
- In the model-as-a-service setting, the vendor cannot share the full PLM with the customer due to confidentiality, and the customer cannot share private data with the vendor. This hinders privacy-conscious users from using the PLM customization service.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Split-and-Privatize (SAP) federated learning framework to enable privacy-preserving PLM fine-tuning.
- The key ideas are:
   - Split PLM into a top model (vendor) and bottom model (customer) to protect model privacy.
   - Customer privatizes text representations before sending to vendor to protect data privacy.
- Flexible framework combining model split with differential privacy or other privacy techniques.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the problem of privacy-preserving PLM fine-tuning in model-as-a-service settings.
- Proposes the SAP framework that protects both model privacy and data privacy.
- Introduces a Contributing-Token-Identification method to improve utility-privacy tradeoff.
- Comprehensively evaluates SAP on multiple NLP datasets and tasks. Shows SAP achieves good balance between utility and privacy.
- Demonstrates SAP is a flexible framework that can adapt to different application scenarios by adjusting model split and privacy settings.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in enabling practical privacy-preserving PLM customization services to facilitate the adoption of large language models.
