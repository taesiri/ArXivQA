# [Token Alignment via Character Matching for Subword Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative language models can struggle when given prompts with partial/incomplete tokens, leading to incorrect or nonsensical outputs. This happens because partial tokens are out-of-distribution compared to the tokens seen during training.
- Several partial token scenarios are identified: subwords, punctuation, space prefix, contiguous spaces. These are nuanced and lead to degraded performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- Token alignment method which backtracks to the last complete tokens and ensures generation is compatible with the prompt prefix. This is done by filtering tokens using a character/byte level trie and masking incompatible tokens.

- Efficient implementation using tries and masking caches to minimize latency impact. Overall latency increase is small (3-7 ms).

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of various partial token scenarios that negatively impact language model performance.
- Novel token alignment algorithm to address partial token issues with efficient caching and tries. 
- Significant gains over baseline on newly constructed partial token datasets across programming, question answering and text generation tasks.
- Ablation studies analyze compatibility with subword regularization, latency tradeoffs, number of backtrack tokens.

In summary, the paper introduces and validates a practical method called token alignment to enhance robustness of language models to partial token prompts with little latency increase. The method and analysis provide meaningful improvements for real-world applications like code completion and text autocompletion.
