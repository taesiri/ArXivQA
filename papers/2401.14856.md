# [Memory-Inspired Temporal Prompt Interaction for Text-Image   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved great success in multimodal tasks. However, fine-tuning these gigantic models for downstream tasks requires significant computational resources. Therefore, prompt-based cross-modal interaction strategies have emerged to enable efficient adaptation, but existing methods lack sufficient interactions between modalities as they do not directly interact the trainable prompts. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy called Memory-Inspired Temporal Prompt Interaction (MITP). The key idea is to introduce temporal prompts on intermediate layers of an LMM to store layer-wise unimodal information. The prompts interact directly in a memory hub module to exchange cross-modal information and generate updated prompts in a memory-inspired way. Specifically, it involves:

1) Acquiring stage: Leverage temporal prompts on LMM's intermediate layers to acquire and store unimodal features of that layer.

2) Consolidation: Calculate similarities between prompts to highlight important logits for memory consolidation. 

3) Activation: Produce activation vectors based on consolidation results, integrate information from both modalities, and generate updated prompts.

Only the prompt vectors and memory hub components are trainable while the LMM backbone is frozen. This enables sufficient cross-modal interactions with low complexity.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new prompt-based interaction strategy that enables direct interaction between prompts of different modalities for better information flow.

- Designs a memory-inspired framework with temporal prompts and memory hub to imitate human memory mechanisms.

- Achieves competitive performance on multiple datasets with only 2M trainable parameters and low memory usage, demonstrating efficiency.

- Outperforms existing prompt-based methods and surpasses methods using the same foundation model, proving effectiveness.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient and effective prompt-based interaction strategy for multimodal learning, with ideas inspired by human memory mechanisms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel multimodal interaction strategy called Memory-Inspired Temporal Prompt Interaction (MITP) which leverages temporal prompts on intermediate layers to enable sufficient inter-modality information exchange through direct prompt interactions while reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new form of multimodal interaction framework called Memory-Inspired Temporal Prompt Interaction, which enables sufficient information flow between modalities through direct interaction of prompts on intermediate layers. 

2. Proposing the use of temporal prompts to store layer-wise information and imitate human memory mechanisms like acquisition and consolidation/activation. This is done through a memory hub that interacts prompts and generates prompts in a memory-inspired way.

3. Significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory usage compared to finetuning methods, while still achieving competitive results on several public multimodal classification datasets. Specifically, using only 2.0M trainable parameters (about 1% of the foundation model) and relatively small memory usage.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy inspired by human memory that enables effective information exchange between modalities and achieves good performance with low training overhead.
