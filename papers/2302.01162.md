# [Get3DHuman: Lifting StyleGAN-Human into a 3D Generative Model using   Pixel-aligned Reconstruction Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01162)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality and diverse 3D textured human models without requiring a large dataset of 3D ground truth data? 

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:

- Leveraging priors from 2D human image generators (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D human reconstructor (PIFu) to provide inductive bias and supervision for training the 3D generator. This avoids the need for a large 3D ground truth dataset.

- Proposing a novel prior induction mechanism to map the latent space of StyleGAN-Human to shape and texture feature volumes compatible with PIFu's feature space. The outputs provide supervisory signals for training the 3D generator.

- Designing tailored losses (latent prior loss, adversarial loss, normal/depth losses) applied to generated 3D volumes and intermediate features to enable effective and efficient training.

- A refinement module to further improve the quality of generated textures by performing image-to-image translation and back-projecting refined textures to the 3D model.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in generating high quality and diverse 3D human models compared to previous methods. The model also supports applications like shape interpolation, retexturing, and inversion.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is utilizing 2D/3D priors to overcome the lack of 3D training data, and designing an effective 3D generative framework capitalizing on these priors. The results significantly advance 3D human generation quality and diversity while requiring minimal 3D supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The key contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Proposing a new 3D human generation framework called Get3DHuman that can generate high-quality and diverse 3D textured human models. 

- Leveraging priors from 2D human generators (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D reconstructors (PIFu) to facilitate training without requiring a large corpus of 3D ground truth data. They extract shape and texture features from StyleGAN-Human outputs using a PIFu-like reconstructor as supervision.

- Introducing specially-designed losses including a latent prior loss, an adversarial feature volume loss, and intermediate losses on normal/depth maps for effective training.

- Demonstrating high-quality 3D human generation results that outperform state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. The framework also supports applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing, and inversion from images.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel way to generate 3D textured human models by incorporating 2D and 3D priors to address the limitation of 3D ground truth data. The tailored losses and training strategy also help achieve improved quality and diversity compared to prior arts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Get3DHuman, a novel 3D human generation framework that incorporates priors from 2D human generators and 3D reconstructors to achieve high-quality and diverse 3D clothed human generation using a limited budget of 3D ground-truth data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D human generation:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework to generate high-quality 3D textured human models by incorporating 2D image generation and 3D reconstruction priors. Specifically, they leverage StyleGAN-Human and pixel-aligned reconstruction networks like PIFu to provide strong priors and supervisory signals. 

Compared to other 3D human generation works, this approach has several advantages:

- It does not require a large dataset of 3D human ground truth data, which is difficult to obtain. By utilizing 2D and 3D priors, it can be trained with limited 3D data.

- The quality and diversity of generated humans are significantly improved over previous works like EG3D, SDF-StyleGAN, and GET3D. The paper demonstrates this through both quantitative metrics and visual results.

- The framework supports useful applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing, and inversion from a single image. This is enabled by disentangled shape and texture representations.

- The two-branch architecture with shape and texture generators is more advanced than single-branch alternatives. The intermediate supervision and tailored losses also help with training stability and quality.

Compared to HumanGen, a concurrent work, this paper builds generative models for both shape and texture instead of just texture. So it constructs a true latent space for 3D textured humans rather than reusing shape geometries.

Overall, the results and comparisons show this paper pushes the state-of-the-art for 3D human generation, achieving more realistic, diverse, and controllable results. The idea of incorporating complementary 2D and 3D priors is an interesting direction for future generative modeling research as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the quality and diversity of generated 3D human models. The authors state that there is still room for improvement in terms of both fidelity and diversity of the generated 3D humans. They suggest exploring ways to boost the realism and diversity further, such as incorporating more 3D data or priors.

- Supporting more complex poses and motions. The method currently is restricted to generating simple standing poses due to limitations of the 2D generators used. The authors suggest extending the framework to enable generating humans in more varied and complex poses.

- Expanding to broader categories beyond humans. The method focuses specifically on generating 3D clothed human models. The authors suggest exploring how well the approach could generalize to other categories of shapes beyond just humans.

- Applications in virtual try-on and fashion. The authors propose that the ability to generate and manipulate 3D human models could have useful applications for virtual try-on, digital fashion and other areas. More research could be done to develop and evaluate applications leveraging the 3D human generation capability.

- Inverse graphics for reconstruction. The latent space inversion capability could be further explored and developed into a full 3D human reconstruction approach from images or video as an alternative to traditional graphics-based reconstruction pipelines.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving quality and diversity of results, expanding the capability to more complex poses and motions, applying the method to new domains beyond just humans, and developing practical applications in virtual try-on, digital fashion, and 3D reconstruction from visual data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents a new generative model called Get3DHuman for creating diverse, high-quality 3D clothed human models. The key idea is to leverage priors from existing top-performing 2D human image generators and 3D reconstruction networks to facilitate training the 3D generator without requiring a large corpus of 3D ground truth data. Specifically, a prior network first maps the input latent code to predicted shape and texture volumes that are supervised by a pixel-aligned 3D reconstructor network. These outputs are then used as supervisory signals for the main 3D generator network, which consists of separate shape and texture branches. Several tailored losses are applied to the generated volumes and intermediate features for effective training. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in generating realistic and detailed 3D human models. The model supports applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing, and inversion from a single image.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes G3DHuman, a novel framework for generating high-quality 3D textured human models. The key idea is to leverage priors from 2D human image generators like StyleGAN-Human and 3D human reconstructors like Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function (PIFu) to facilitate training of the 3D generator. Specifically, a prior network is first trained to map random codes to shape and texture feature volumes that are consistent with PIFu latent spaces. These feature volumes serve as supervisory signals for the main 3D generator network, which contains separate shape and texture branches. Three losses are applied during training - a latent prior loss on the feature volumes, an adversarial loss on intermediate features instead of final SDF, and geometry losses on normal/depth predictions. A refinement module is also introduced to further improve texture quality. 

Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in generating diverse, high-fidelity 3D human models. The framework supports applications like shape interpolation, shape re-texturing by sampling different texture codes, and inversion to reconstruct 3D humans from reference images. Limitations include restriction to simple standing poses due to reliance on StyleGAN-Human. But overall, the paper presents an effective way to achieve high-quality 3D human generation by incorporating well-established 2D and 3D priors.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D human generation framework called Get3DHuman that can generate high-quality and diverse 3D clothed human models. The key idea is to leverage priors from pre-trained 2D human image generators (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D reconstructors (PIFu) to supervise the training of the 3D generator, avoiding the need for large amounts of 3D ground truth data. Specifically, a prior network first maps the input latent code to shape and texture feature volumes that are consistent with PIFu's latent space. These feature volumes are used to supervise the training of the main 3D generator which has separate shape and texture branches. Three losses are used for training - a latent prior loss directly on the feature volumes, an adversarial loss on the feature volumes instead of 3D shapes to reduce complexity, and intermediate losses using predicted normal/depth maps. The shape and texture branches are trained separately. An additional refinement network can further improve the texture quality. Experiments show the method outperforms previous state-of-the-art 3D human generators in terms of both quality and diversity.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new method for generating high-quality 3D human models. Specifically, it is aiming to address the challenge of generating diverse and realistic 3D textured human models when only limited 3D ground truth data is available. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Leveraging priors from 2D human image generators (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D reconstruction networks (PIFu) to supervise the training of the 3D generator, avoiding the need for large 3D datasets.

- A prior induction mechanism to map the latent space of StyleGAN-Human to shape and texture feature volumes that can be decoded by PIFu. This acts as supervision for the 3D generator.

- Three tailored losses applied to the generated feature volumes and intermediate features to ensure effective training.

- A shape generator and texture generator with refinement to output high quality geometry and appearance.

- Applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing, and inversion from an image demonstrated.

Overall, the main contribution is a novel way to train high-quality 3D human generators by incorporating inductive biases from top 2D generators and 3D reconstructors, circumventing the need for large 3D training sets. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the improved diversity and realism of the generated 3D humans compared to other state-of-the-art methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Generative adversarial networks (GANs): The paper utilizes GANs as the backbone framework for generating 3D human models. The adversarial training between the generator and discriminator networks is a core component.

- Implicit neural representations: The paper represents the generated 3D humans using implicit neural fields rather than explicit meshes or voxels. The shape and texture are encoded as separate signed distance functions and RGB color fields.

- Differentiable rendering: The paper uses differentiable rendering of the implicit fields to obtain 2D images for adversarial training. This avoids needing explicit 3D supervision.

- Shape and texture disentanglement: The proposed method disentangles shape and texture generation through separate shape and texture branches. This enables controllable generation and editing.

- Prior incorporation: The method incorporates priors from a 2D image generator (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D reconstructor (PIFu) to improve results without needing large 3D datasets.

- Single-image inference: The trained model supports inversion from a single input photo to generate a textured 3D avatar. Useful for reconstruction and editing.

- Downstream applications: The approach enables downstream applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing generated models, and inversion from reference images.

In summary, the key themes are leveraging GANs and implicit neural representations for 3D human generation, using differentiable rendering and prior incorporation for training, and supporting controllable generation and editing for downstream applications.
