# [Get3DHuman: Lifting StyleGAN-Human into a 3D Generative Model using   Pixel-aligned Reconstruction Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01162)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate high-quality and diverse 3D textured human models without requiring a large dataset of 3D ground truth data? 

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:

- Leveraging priors from 2D human image generators (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D human reconstructor (PIFu) to provide inductive bias and supervision for training the 3D generator. This avoids the need for a large 3D ground truth dataset.

- Proposing a novel prior induction mechanism to map the latent space of StyleGAN-Human to shape and texture feature volumes compatible with PIFu's feature space. The outputs provide supervisory signals for training the 3D generator.

- Designing tailored losses (latent prior loss, adversarial loss, normal/depth losses) applied to generated 3D volumes and intermediate features to enable effective and efficient training.

- A refinement module to further improve the quality of generated textures by performing image-to-image translation and back-projecting refined textures to the 3D model.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in generating high quality and diverse 3D human models compared to previous methods. The model also supports applications like shape interpolation, retexturing, and inversion.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is utilizing 2D/3D priors to overcome the lack of 3D training data, and designing an effective 3D generative framework capitalizing on these priors. The results significantly advance 3D human generation quality and diversity while requiring minimal 3D supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The key contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Proposing a new 3D human generation framework called Get3DHuman that can generate high-quality and diverse 3D textured human models. 

- Leveraging priors from 2D human generators (StyleGAN-Human) and 3D reconstructors (PIFu) to facilitate training without requiring a large corpus of 3D ground truth data. They extract shape and texture features from StyleGAN-Human outputs using a PIFu-like reconstructor as supervision.

- Introducing specially-designed losses including a latent prior loss, an adversarial feature volume loss, and intermediate losses on normal/depth maps for effective training.

- Demonstrating high-quality 3D human generation results that outperform state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. The framework also supports applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing, and inversion from images.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel way to generate 3D textured human models by incorporating 2D and 3D priors to address the limitation of 3D ground truth data. The tailored losses and training strategy also help achieve improved quality and diversity compared to prior arts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Get3DHuman, a novel 3D human generation framework that incorporates priors from 2D human generators and 3D reconstructors to achieve high-quality and diverse 3D clothed human generation using a limited budget of 3D ground-truth data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D human generation:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework to generate high-quality 3D textured human models by incorporating 2D image generation and 3D reconstruction priors. Specifically, they leverage StyleGAN-Human and pixel-aligned reconstruction networks like PIFu to provide strong priors and supervisory signals. 

Compared to other 3D human generation works, this approach has several advantages:

- It does not require a large dataset of 3D human ground truth data, which is difficult to obtain. By utilizing 2D and 3D priors, it can be trained with limited 3D data.

- The quality and diversity of generated humans are significantly improved over previous works like EG3D, SDF-StyleGAN, and GET3D. The paper demonstrates this through both quantitative metrics and visual results.

- The framework supports useful applications like shape interpolation, re-texturing, and inversion from a single image. This is enabled by disentangled shape and texture representations.

- The two-branch architecture with shape and texture generators is more advanced than single-branch alternatives. The intermediate supervision and tailored losses also help with training stability and quality.

Compared to HumanGen, a concurrent work, this paper builds generative models for both shape and texture instead of just texture. So it constructs a true latent space for 3D textured humans rather than reusing shape geometries.

Overall, the results and comparisons show this paper pushes the state-of-the-art for 3D human generation, achieving more realistic, diverse, and controllable results. The idea of incorporating complementary 2D and 3D priors is an interesting direction for future generative modeling research as well.
