# [Diverse Representation Embedding for Lifelong Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to continuously learn from sequential person re-id datasets captured by different cameras. 
- Two key challenges in LReID: 1) Limited representation capacity of models to extract discriminative features from limited data. 2) Domain gaps across different datasets leading to catastrophic forgetting of old tasks when learning new tasks.  

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Diverse Representation Embedding (DRE) framework for LReID that preserves old knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

- Generate diverse representations for each instance using multiple class tokens from a Vision Transformer: one primary and two auxiliary embeddings.

- Propose an Adaptive Constraint Module (ACM) to integrate the auxiliary representations into the primary while minimizing overlap, enhancing discrimination.  

- Introduce Knowledge Update (KU) strategies including logit-level distillation and slow update of the adjustment model to facilitate knowledge transfer to the learner model when learning new tasks.

- Propose Knowledge Preservation (KP) strategies including representation alignment and logit-level supervision to mitigate forgetting when learning sequentially. 

- Overall, ACM enhances representation capacity, while KU and KP reduce domain gaps across tasks over time.

Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce a pure transformer architecture for lifelong person re-identification task.

- Novel adaptive constraint module to generate and integrate diverse discriminative representations of each instance.

- Knowledge update and preservation strategies to achieve trade-off between adapting to new tasks and preserving old knowledge over extended periods.

- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seen and unseen datasets across multiple metrics, especially on large-scale and occluded datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a diverse representation embedding framework for lifelong person re-identification that generates discriminative representations at the instance level and reduces task-level domain gaps through knowledge update and preservation strategies to balance preserving old knowledge and adapting to new information over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel Diverse Representation Embedding (DRE) framework for lifelong person re-identification (LReID) that provides discrimination representation for each instance while improving the model's capability to match representations and labels under the same IDs. This effectively preserves old knowledge and adapts to new information over time. 

2) Proposing knowledge update and knowledge preservation strategies at the instance-level and task-level layout to reduce task-level domain gaps and excavate diverse representation of each instance in limited old task datasets. 

3) Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate the proposed DRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both seen and unseen datasets, especially showing improved performance on large-scale and occluded datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a transformer-based framework that generates diverse representations to achieve better trade-off between retaining old knowledge and adapting to new information in lifelong person re-identification. The strategies introduced help match representations to the same identities and reduce gaps between tasks. Experiments validate its superior performance.
