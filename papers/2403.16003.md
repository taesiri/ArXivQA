# [Diverse Representation Embedding for Lifelong Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to continuously learn from sequential person re-id datasets captured by different cameras. 
- Two key challenges in LReID: 1) Limited representation capacity of models to extract discriminative features from limited data. 2) Domain gaps across different datasets leading to catastrophic forgetting of old tasks when learning new tasks.  

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Diverse Representation Embedding (DRE) framework for LReID that preserves old knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

- Generate diverse representations for each instance using multiple class tokens from a Vision Transformer: one primary and two auxiliary embeddings.

- Propose an Adaptive Constraint Module (ACM) to integrate the auxiliary representations into the primary while minimizing overlap, enhancing discrimination.  

- Introduce Knowledge Update (KU) strategies including logit-level distillation and slow update of the adjustment model to facilitate knowledge transfer to the learner model when learning new tasks.

- Propose Knowledge Preservation (KP) strategies including representation alignment and logit-level supervision to mitigate forgetting when learning sequentially. 

- Overall, ACM enhances representation capacity, while KU and KP reduce domain gaps across tasks over time.

Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce a pure transformer architecture for lifelong person re-identification task.

- Novel adaptive constraint module to generate and integrate diverse discriminative representations of each instance.

- Knowledge update and preservation strategies to achieve trade-off between adapting to new tasks and preserving old knowledge over extended periods.

- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seen and unseen datasets across multiple metrics, especially on large-scale and occluded datasets.
