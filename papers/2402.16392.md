# [Placing Objects in Context via Inpainting for Out-of-distribution   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Placing Objects in Context via Inpainting for Out-of-distribution Segmentation":

Problem: 
When deploying semantic segmentation models in the real world, they will inevitably encounter object classes not seen during training. It is crucial to evaluate and improve their ability to detect such "out-of-distribution" (OOD) objects for safe deployment. However, acquiring images and labels for all possible OOD objects is infeasible. Existing OOD segmentation datasets have limited diversity of anomalies, lack realism or have domain shift from training data. 

Solution:
The paper proposes the "Placing Objects in Context" (POC) pipeline to realistically add any object into any image via diffusion models. POC selects a valid location in the image using segmentation guidance ("the road"), feeds the location to an inpainting model with a text prompt ("a cat") to generate the object, automatically labels it using segmentation again, and blends for smooth transitions.

Contributions:
1) POC pipeline to easily extend datasets with arbitrary new objects for anomaly segmentation
2) Three new evaluation sets (POC-CS, POC-IDD, POC-ACDC) based on driving datasets with 25 OOD classes  
3) Experiments showing POC data improves state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods over standard practice of stitching COCO objects 
4) POC can also be used to learn new classes from scratch - adding animals to Cityscapes leads to 93.14 mIoU on Pascal (animals only) vs 94.75 when trained on real Pascal images

In summary, the paper introduces a versatile pipeline to generate realistic anomaly segmentation data on-the-fly, validated on multiple datasets and methods. The dynamic nature and simplicity of POC facilitates evaluating OOD detection.
