# [VILA: On Pre-training for Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07533)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper explores effective design choices for pre-training visual language models (VLMs) by augmenting large language models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. Through systematic ablation studies, the authors make several key findings: (1) Fine-tuning the LLM during pre-training is essential for aligning multimodal embeddings and enabling stronger in-context learning, despite some text performance degradation. (2) Interleaved image-text corpora like MMC4 are better than pure image-text pairs for pre-training, as they provide more accurate language modeling gradients while retaining text capabilities. (3) Blending back some of the original text-only data during downstream tuning not only recovers text performance but also further improves VLM accuracy. Leveraging these insights, the authors build VILA, a VLM family that outperforms prior state-of-the-art like LLaVA across 12 vision-language tasks. Benefiting from enhanced pre-training, VILA also exhibits appealing capabilities like multi-image reasoning, robust in-context learning, and improved world knowledge. Through meticulous analysis and comparisons, this paper provides practical guidance for designing effective VLMs and demonstrates the importance of multimodal pre-training - despite using less data than prior work, VILA convincingly beats larger models. The insights should inform future efforts in scaling up VLMs.
