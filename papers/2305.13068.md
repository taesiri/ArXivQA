# [Making Language Models Better Tool Learners with Execution Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13068)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: 

\textbf{Can we teach language models when and how to use tools?}

Specifically, the authors aim to develop methods to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively learn:

1) When tools should be used - i.e. discerning when utilizing tools is necessary versus when the LLM's own capabilities are sufficient.

2) How to properly use tools - including selecting the right tools, generating valid inputs, and effectively utilizing the outputs. 

The key goal is to impart LLMs with the meta-cognitive abilities to selectively leverage tools in an accurate and judicious manner, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. This should allow the LLM to avoid detrimental effects like error propagation when simpler problems can be readily solved without tools.

To summarize, the central research question is focused on improving LLMs' capabilities as tool learners, through targeted training techniques that teach when and how to properly utilize external tools.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes TRICE, a two-stage end-to-end training framework that leverages execution feedback to help LLMs become more proficient tool learners. 

- It achieves superior performance on two benchmark datasets compared to previous fine-tuning-based tool learning methods.

- Through extensive analysis, it demonstrates that the TRICE framework can guide the model in judicious tool usage, thereby reducing the model's dependency on tools and improving the precision of tool use.

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Construct a dataset to discern when LLMs need tools versus when they can answer correctly without tools. Use untrained LLMs to generate answers - correct ones don't need tools, incorrect ones likely need tools. Use ChatGPT to generate pseudo-labels for tool APIs. 

- Two-stage training strategy: 1) Behavior cloning to teach tool APIs, 2) Reinforcement learning with execution feedback (RLEF) to teach selective tool usage. RLEF uses a simple RL algorithm and replaces rewards with tool execution results.

- Experiments on math reasoning datasets show performance gains over baseline methods. Analysis shows the approach reduces over-reliance on tools and improves tool usage accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel training approach called TRICE that uses execution feedback to improve how judiciously LLMs utilize tools, balancing usage versus direct reasoning. Both performance gains and extensive analysis back this up.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework called TRICE for training language models to judiciously utilize external tools by constructing a dataset to discern when tools are needed, first imitating tool usage behavior through supervised learning and then reinforcing selective tool usage through a simple reinforcement learning method with execution feedback.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related work in tool learning:

- Unlike some prior work like Toolformer that teaches LLMs to directly utilize tools themselves via self-supervised fine-tuning, this paper takes a tool-augmented learning approach where the LLM acts as a decision-making hub that selectively determines when and how to use external tools. 

- Compared to other tool-augmented methods, a key distinction of this work is the focus on making the LLM a better tool learner by teaching it to use tools selectively instead of mindlessly/indiscriminately. The two-stage training strategy aims to impart judicious tool usage.

- For training, this paper introduces a new Reinforcement Learning with Execution Feedback (RLEF) approach. In contrast to prior human feedback-based RL methods like RLHF, RLEF provides the reward signal using the execution results of tool usage. The simple RRHF algorithm is used as the RL backbone.

- The overall framework trains end-to-end by constructing a dataset to discern when tools are needed, using ChatGPT to automatically generate tool APIs, and optimizing with behavior cloning then RLEF. This is a more automated pipeline compared to methods requiring extensive human annotation. 

- Experiments demonstrate improved performance over fine-tuning baselines on mathematical reasoning tasks. Analyses provide insights into how the approach reduces model reliance on tools and improves precision of tool usage compared to just behavior cloning.

In summary, the key novelty of this work lies in its focus on judicious tool usage, the introduction of RLEF for training, and the overall end-to-end framework enabling LLMs to learn to use tools more selectively and effectively compared to prior methods. The automated data generation and simple RL training approach also help advance the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Investigate the use of multiple tools and tool compositions. The current method is limited to learning the usage of a single tool. More complex trial-and-error processes and feedback mechanisms will be needed to teach language models to utilize and even create new tools.

- Apply the approach to more specialized domains like biomedicine and law, where accuracy and reliability of knowledge are critical. The model's ability to differentiate valuable vs irrelevant or harmful knowledge becomes even more important here.

- Develop more sophisticated reward mechanisms that integrate feedback across diverse tasks and scenarios. This will help adapt the approach to multi-task learning and enhance generalization.

- Scale up experiments with larger models and datasets to further validate the approach. The current 7B parameter model may limit performance on complex mathematical reasoning.

- Explore different reinforcement learning algorithms and training strategies for more stable and sample-efficient learning. The instability of RL training likely contributes to some tool usage errors.

In summary, the key future directions are 1) extending to multi-tool usage and creation, 2) applying to high-stakes domains requiring reliable knowledge, 3) designing multi-task rewards, 4) scaling up models and data, and 5) improving RL training stability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TRICE, a two-stage end-to-end framework that leverages execution feedback to help large language models become better at learning when and how to use tools effectively. It first constructs a dataset to discern when tools are needed by having an untrained model answer questions directly, with incorrect responses indicating the need for tools. ChatGPT generates pseudo-labeled tool APIs for the incorrect responses. The two training stages are behavior cloning to teach basic tool usage, and reinforcement learning with execution feedback (RLEF) to enhance selective tool usage. RLEF leverages a simple reward mechanism based on the proximity between tool execution results and gold answers to guide tool selection. Experiments on math reasoning datasets show TRICE reduces model reliance on tools while improving tool usage accuracy compared to fine-tuning baselines. The paper demonstrates TRICE's ability to teach models when tools are needed versus when model knowledge alone suffices.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Trice for teaching language models to become better tool learners. The key idea is to leverage execution feedback to help the model learn when and how to properly use tools. The authors introduce a two-stage training approach. In the first stage, they use behavior cloning to teach the model how to invoke tools through supervised fine-tuning. In the second stage, they apply reinforcement learning with execution feedback (RLEF) to train the model to use tools more selectively and accurately. RLEF reinforces the model based on the RRHF algorithm using the results of tool execution as reward signals. 

The authors evaluate Trice on two math reasoning datasets. Results show it outperforms previous fine-tuning methods for tool learning. Analysis demonstrates Trice can guide the model to use tools more judiciously - reducing dependence on tools while improving precision. The approach faces limitations in handling multiple tools and compositions. Future work involves more advanced trial-and-error processes and feedback to teach better tool usage and even tool creation. Overall, the paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework leveraging execution feedback to develop language models into more proficient tool learners.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes TRICE, a two-stage training framework to help language models learn to judiciously use external tools. The key method can be summarized as:

In the first stage, behavior cloning is used to teach the language model the basic schema of tool API calls by imitating tool usage behavior from a dataset. This equips the model with preliminary skills for tool invocation. 

In the second stage, reinforcement learning with execution feedback (RLEF) is applied to refine the model's capability in selective tool usage. A simple reinforcement learning algorithm called RRHF is adapted, where the reward signal comes from executing the model's tool API calls and evaluating the prediction quality. This enables the model to continually learn from the feedback loop of trial-and-error, guiding it towards more accurate decisions on when and how to utilize tools.

Through this two-stage approach of imitation followed by reinforcement with execution feedback, the model learns to judiciously leverage tools only when needed, while avoiding blind tool usage which may propagate errors. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TRICE in enhancing tool usage precision and reducing model reliance on tools.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper is addressing is: 

\textbf{How can we teach language models when and how to properly use external tools?}

The paper points out that existing methods tend to make language models utilize tools indiscriminately, even when the models themselves can readily solve simple problems. However, introducing tools unnecessarily can propagate errors rather than enhance performance. 

Therefore, the authors propose a framework called TRICE that aims to teach language models to selectively use tools through a two-stage training process:

1) Behavior cloning to teach the model the schema of tool usage. 

2) Reinforcement learning with execution feedback (RLEF) to guide the model to judiciously choose when to use tools to avoid error propagation.

The goal is to reduce the model's dependency on tools while also improving the precision of tool usage. The experiments focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and aim to demonstrate that TRICE can make language models better at discerning when tools are needed versus when they can solve problems on their own.

In summary, the key research question is how to impart stronger abilities to language models to determine when and how to properly utilize external tools. The TRICE framework is proposed to address this challenge.
