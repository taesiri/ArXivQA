# Making Language Models Better Tool Learners with Execution Feedback

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: \textbf{Can we teach language models when and how to use tools?}Specifically, the authors aim to develop methods to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively learn:1) When tools should be used - i.e. discerning when utilizing tools is necessary versus when the LLM's own capabilities are sufficient.2) How to properly use tools - including selecting the right tools, generating valid inputs, and effectively utilizing the outputs. The key goal is to impart LLMs with the meta-cognitive abilities to selectively leverage tools in an accurate and judicious manner, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. This should allow the LLM to avoid detrimental effects like error propagation when simpler problems can be readily solved without tools.To summarize, the central research question is focused on improving LLMs' capabilities as tool learners, through targeted training techniques that teach when and how to properly utilize external tools.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes TRICE, a two-stage end-to-end training framework that leverages execution feedback to help LLMs become more proficient tool learners. - It achieves superior performance on two benchmark datasets compared to previous fine-tuning-based tool learning methods.- Through extensive analysis, it demonstrates that the TRICE framework can guide the model in judicious tool usage, thereby reducing the model's dependency on tools and improving the precision of tool use.Specifically, the key ideas are:- Construct a dataset to discern when LLMs need tools versus when they can answer correctly without tools. Use untrained LLMs to generate answers - correct ones don't need tools, incorrect ones likely need tools. Use ChatGPT to generate pseudo-labels for tool APIs. - Two-stage training strategy: 1) Behavior cloning to teach tool APIs, 2) Reinforcement learning with execution feedback (RLEF) to teach selective tool usage. RLEF uses a simple RL algorithm and replaces rewards with tool execution results.- Experiments on math reasoning datasets show performance gains over baseline methods. Analysis shows the approach reduces over-reliance on tools and improves tool usage accuracy.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel training approach called TRICE that uses execution feedback to improve how judiciously LLMs utilize tools, balancing usage versus direct reasoning. Both performance gains and extensive analysis back this up.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage framework called TRICE for training language models to judiciously utilize external tools by constructing a dataset to discern when tools are needed, first imitating tool usage behavior through supervised learning and then reinforcing selective tool usage through a simple reinforcement learning method with execution feedback.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related work in tool learning:- Unlike some prior work like Toolformer that teaches LLMs to directly utilize tools themselves via self-supervised fine-tuning, this paper takes a tool-augmented learning approach where the LLM acts as a decision-making hub that selectively determines when and how to use external tools. - Compared to other tool-augmented methods, a key distinction of this work is the focus on making the LLM a better tool learner by teaching it to use tools selectively instead of mindlessly/indiscriminately. The two-stage training strategy aims to impart judicious tool usage.- For training, this paper introduces a new Reinforcement Learning with Execution Feedback (RLEF) approach. In contrast to prior human feedback-based RL methods like RLHF, RLEF provides the reward signal using the execution results of tool usage. The simple RRHF algorithm is used as the RL backbone.- The overall framework trains end-to-end by constructing a dataset to discern when tools are needed, using ChatGPT to automatically generate tool APIs, and optimizing with behavior cloning then RLEF. This is a more automated pipeline compared to methods requiring extensive human annotation. - Experiments demonstrate improved performance over fine-tuning baselines on mathematical reasoning tasks. Analyses provide insights into how the approach reduces model reliance on tools and improves precision of tool usage compared to just behavior cloning.In summary, the key novelty of this work lies in its focus on judicious tool usage, the introduction of RLEF for training, and the overall end-to-end framework enabling LLMs to learn to use tools more selectively and effectively compared to prior methods. The automated data generation and simple RL training approach also help advance the field.
