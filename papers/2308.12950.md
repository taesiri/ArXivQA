# [Code Llama: Open Foundation Models for Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we create an open source family of large language models specialized for code that provides state-of-the-art performance on code generation benchmarks while also supporting capabilities like infilling and handling long input contexts?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Specializing the general purpose LLaMA model for code through continued pre-training on a code-focused dataset and other techniques will improve performance on code generation benchmarks compared to the original LLaMA model.

2) Adding infilling capabilities to the medium-sized models will enable use cases like code completion without significantly hurting performance on standard benchmarks. 

3) Fine-tuning the models to handle much longer input contexts than seen during pre-training will improve performance on tasks requiring long contexts like code completion, without hurting short-context performance.

So in summary, the central research questions seem to revolve around how to take the general LLaMA foundation model and specialize it for code in different ways, while preserving or improving key capabilities like generation quality, infilling, and using long contexts. The paper then presents Code Llama models tuned in different ways as strong open source models for code.

- Leveraging execution traces or dynamic analysis to include runtime information in the summarization. Most techniques currently rely only on static analysis.

- Evaluating summarization techniques on additional programming languages beyond Java and Python. Much of the current research focuses just on these two languages.

- Creating customized summarization systems tailored for specific applications like bug localization, code search, software maintenance, etc. Current approaches are generic.

- Combining code summarization with natural language techniques for generating more coherent and readable summaries.

- Developing conditional and controllable summarization techniques that can produce different summaries based on specified criteria.

- Studying the effects of different granularities of summarization, from method level to class or file level. Most work has focused on method level so far.

- Creating datasets and benchmarks for additional tasks such as codecomment generation to further advance research.

So in summary, the main future directions are developing more scalable and robust algorithms, incorporating additional semantic and dynamic features of code, evaluating on more languages and applications, integrating NL techniques, and exploring conditional summarization and datasets.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Code-LLaMA, a family of large language models specialized for code that provides state-of-the-art performance among open models on code generation benchmarks. The authors release three main variants - Code-LLaMA, PyCode-LLaMA, and InstructCode-LLaMA - each in sizes of 7B, 13B and 34B parameters. All models are trained on sequences of 16K tokens and can handle inputs up to 100K tokens. The 7B and 13B variants support infilling based on surrounding code context. On benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, Code-LLaMA models achieve scores exceeding 50% and 55% respectively, outperforming previous publicly available models like LLamaV2. The authors also demonstrate strong performance on multilingual benchmarks spanning languages like C++, Java and Bash. A key contribution is the models' ability to leverage long input contexts, enabled by modifying the rotary position embeddings during fine-tuning. The released models aim to provide capable and open foundation models for code that can be adapted for a wide range of downstream applications.

In more detail, the paper describes how the Code-LLaMA models are obtained by further training the general-purpose LLamaV2 models on a large corpus of public code data. The authors use techniques like infilling training and long context fine-tuning to equip the smaller 7B and 13B models with capabilities tailored for code completion. Evaluations demonstrate the value of model specialization, with additional fine-tuning steps on code data consistently improving performance over the LLamaV2 foundations. The models also show strong generalization ability, with the smallest 7B model surpassing LLamaV2-70B on some metrics. For safer deployment, the InstructCode-LLaMA variants are further fine-tuned using human feedback data from LLamaV2 and additional automatically generated data. The paper includes extensive analyses like scaling studies, multilingual evaluations, and ablations examining the impact of infilling training. Overall, Code-LLaMA provides capable and open foundation models for code that set new benchmarks for public models of their size.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a two-stage training approach with pretraining and fine-tuning. What are the key benefits of this approach compared to end-to-end training? How does pretraining allow the model architecture and hyperparameters to be optimized separately from the downstream task?

2. The rotary position embeddings (RoPE) are a key component of the model architecture. How do RoPE help the model handle longer input sequences compared to absolute or relative position embeddings? What are the tradeoffs in modifying the RoPE base frequency during fine-tuning for longer contexts?

3. During fine-tuning, the authors use sequences of length 16K rather than the full 100K context length supported at inference. What are the potential benefits of this intermediate fine-tuning sequence length? Does it allow more stable optimization or regularization compared to immediately jumping to 100K? 

4. The authors fine-tune existing LLaMAv2 models rather than training from scratch. What benefits does transfer learning provide in this case? How much compute time and data is saved by leveraging the pretrained weights? Are there any downsides?

5. The infilling training objective is only used for 7B and 13B models. What are the tradeoffs in terms of downstream performance vs. infilling ability? Why was infilling not used for the 34B model?

6. How does the choice of datasets used for pretraining vs. fine-tuning affect model capabilities? What motivated the specific weights given to code vs. natural language data at different stages?

7. The paper uses several decoding schemes during evaluation like greedy, sampling, top-k. How do these impact metrics like pass@1 vs pass@10? What are the tradeoffs between sample quality and diversity?

8. What validation metrics were used during training? Did the authors do any human evaluations? What potential biases exist in the automatic benchmarks?

9. How does the model handle out-of-distribution examples not represented in the training data? Are there any notable failure modes or weaknesses? What could be done to improve robustness?

10. The authors performed ablation studies on factors like infilling and LCFT. Are there any other important ablations that would provide more insight into the method? What optimizations had the biggest impact?
