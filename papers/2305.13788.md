# [Can Large Language Models Infer and Disagree Like Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13788)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How do large language models (LLMs) perform on natural language inference (NLI) tasks compared to models specifically fine-tuned for NLI? 

2) How well do the output distributions of LLMs align with human disagreement distributions on NLI datasets?

The authors seem to be investigating whether state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit good performance and human-like disagreement on the fundamental NLI task, even without full supervision on NLI datasets. They evaluate LLMs using both accuracy metrics and distributional metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence to compare with human annotator disagreement. The overarching goal seems to be assessing whether LLMs possess true natural language understanding abilities and whether they can represent the diversity of human viewpoints.

In summary, the central research questions revolve around evaluating LLMs on both performance and human alignment on NLI tasks specifically. The authors aim to jointly test LLMs on these two aspects to gain insights into their language understanding capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Evaluating the performance and alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human disagreement on natural language inference (NLI) tasks. Previous work has not studied how well LLMs capture human disagreement on NLI.

2. Proposing two techniques - Monte Carlo Reconstruction (MCR) and Log Probability Reconstruction (LPR) - to reconstruct the output distributions of LLMs on NLI tasks after greedy/beam search decoding which loses information about the full distribution.

3. Testing various state-of-the-art LLMs on NLI datasets with human disagreement annotations and finding that LLMs exhibit limited ability on NLI tasks and fail to capture the human disagreement distribution.

4. Showing LLMs do not perform NLI in a human-like way, raising concerns about their natural language understanding capabilities. The reconstructed LLM distributions deviate from human disagreements.

5. Demonstrating that multiple human annotations and supervised training on NLI are beneficial, but LLMs still fail to represent human disagreement even after training on ambiguous NLI data.

In summary, the key contribution is evaluating LLMs on both performance and human alignment for NLI using distribution reconstruction techniques. The results reveal limitations of LLMs in mimicking human inferential abilities and disagreements.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review, I would summarize the key point of the paper in one sentence as: 

The paper evaluates how well large language models can perform on natural language inference tasks and align with human disagreement distributions, finding they exhibit limited ability in solving these tasks and fail to capture the diversity of human opinions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research on evaluating large language models on natural language inference tasks:

- Assessing both performance and alignment to human disagreement: This paper jointly evaluates LLMs on their accuracy on NLI tasks as well as their ability to capture the distribution of human disagreements. Many prior works focus only on model performance. Evaluating human alignment on disagreement is fairly novel.

- Testing a diverse set of LLMs: The paper examines a broader set of models compared to prior work, including both commercially deployed models like InstructGPT and Stable Vicuna as well as open-sourced models like FLAN. This provides useful insights into different training methodologies. 

- Reconstruction techniques to estimate distribution: The authors propose two techniques - Monte Carlo and Log Probability Reconstruction - to recover the output distribution of LLMs. This allows evaluation of probability distribution when sampling or greedy decoding methods don't expose full information.

- Analysis on multiple datasets: The paper tests models on multiple benchmark NLI datasets with human disagreements annotated, providing a more robust evaluation.

- Focus on pre-trained models without full NLI fine-tuning: Most prior work fine-tunes or trains models specifically for the NLI task. This paper uniquely looks at the zero-shot inference capabilities of large pre-trained LLMs.

Overall, the paper provides a more holistic evaluation framework of LLMs on NLI by assessing both performance and human alignment. The reconstruction techniques and diverse model testing expand understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in fundamental language understanding tasks. The analysis on lack of human disagreement modeling is an important contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate LLMs on a broader range of NLU tasks beyond just NLI, such as question answering, fact verification, toxic language detection, etc. The authors suggest these tasks could also be reformatted into an NLI framework to evaluate LLMs' inference abilities. 

- Improve LLMs to better capture human disagreement distributions by fine-tuning on ambiguous/controversial instances. This could make LLMs more representative of diverse human opinions.

- Extend the work by covering more model types and creating benchmarks to quantitatively measure disagreement alignment between humans and LLMs.

- Further analyze the factors leading to disagreement in both humans and LLMs through the release of more datasets with human disagreement labels. Compare these factors across humans and models.

- Test whether findings generalize to other domain tasks like those mentioned above. The authors expect LLMs may perform similarly poorly on other core language understanding tasks.

- Develop better evaluation criteria beyond just accuracy to assess genuine language understanding in LLMs, since they can be easily fine-tuned to perform better on tasks like NLI.

In summary, the key directions are: evaluating on more tasks, improving disagreement modeling, further analysis of disagreement factors, testing generalization, and developing better evaluation metrics for language understanding. The authors aim to make LLMs more faithful to human opinions and language abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can infer and disagree like humans when evaluating natural language inference (NLI) tasks. NLI tests a model's ability to recognize entailment relationships between sentence pairs. The authors evaluate LLMs on the ChaosNLI and inherent disagreement datasets which contain multiple human annotations capturing differing interpretations. They test model performance on NLI accuracy as well as alignment to the human disagreement distribution using two techniques - Monte Carlo Reconstruction (MCR) and Log Probability Reconstruction (LPR) - to estimate the model output distribution. The results show that while LLMs exhibit limited NLI capabilities, they also fail to capture the diversity of human disagreements and interpretations. This raises concerns about their natural language understanding and representativeness of human users. The authors suggest improvements are needed in LLM training to better reflect human opinions and disagreements for fairer and more accountable language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the performance and human alignment of large language models (LLMs) on natural language inference (NLI) tasks using two datasets - ChaosNLI and PK2019. These datasets contain multiple human annotations per sample to capture inherent disagreements between people. The authors test commercially available LLMs like OPT, Flan, and GPT-3.5 as well as open-source models like Stable Vicuna on the NLI tasks. Since greedy decoding methods do not expose the full probability distribution, the authors use two techniques - Monte Carlo Reconstruction and Log Probability Reconstruction - to estimate the label distribution. They find that while supervised models fine-tuned on NLI perform the best, LLMs exhibit limited ability on NLI tasks and fail to capture the human disagreement patterns. The performance does not always increase with model size. Furthermore, different reconstruction methods and prompt types have varying effects, especially on smaller LLMs. Overall, the results indicate LLMs have limited natural language understanding on NLI tasks and are not representative of the diverse range of human opinions.

In summary, this paper evaluates LLMs on both performance and human alignment on NLI tasks using reconstructed probability distributions. The key findings are: 1) LLMs show poor capability on fundamental NLI problems, 2) LLMs do not reflect human disagreement patterns and are not representative of diverse opinions, 3) Different methods like Monte Carlo vs Log Probability reconstruction and prompt types impact results, especially for smaller LLMs. The limitations include the limited sample of human opinions and not covering the full spectrum of LLMs. Overall, the paper sheds light on continued challenges for LLMs in language understanding and representing user diversity.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes two techniques for reconstructing the probability distribution over class labels from large language model (LLM) outputs - Monte Carlo Reconstruction (MCR) and Log Probability Reconstruction (LPR). MCR generates a large number of output samples from the LLM for a given input and estimates the class probability distribution based on the frequency of samples predicted for each class. LPR leverages the log probabilities returned by some LLM APIs for the top token candidates and sums the log probabilities of valid options for each class to estimate the class probabilities. These reconstructed probability distributions are compared to the human label distribution using metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence. The authors apply MCR and LPR to study the performance and alignment with human disagreement of various LLMs on natural language inference tasks using the ChaosNLI and PK2019 datasets. The key findings are that LLMs exhibit limited ability in solving NLI tasks and fail to capture the human disagreement distribution.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can perform natural language inference (NLI) tasks and align with human disagreement distributions on these tasks. 

Specifically, the paper investigates:

- How well LLMs of different sizes and training approaches perform on NLI datasets like ChaosNLI and PK2019. This evaluates their core capability on this fundamental NLI task.

- Whether LLMs can capture the distribution of labels that reflect human disagreement and variation of opinions on these datasets. This tests if LLMs can represent human perspectives.

The authors note that while LLMs have shown success on many tasks, their abilities on basic inference and modeling human disagreement have been under-explored. By testing both the performance and human alignment of LLMs on NLI using reconstruction techniques, this paper provides a novel assessment.

In summary, the key problem is assessing LLMs' NLI capabilities and their representativeness of human disagreement distributions, which has not been well studied previously. The paper aims to fill this gap.
