# [UCMCTrack: Multi-Object Tracking with Uniform Camera Motion Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08952)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces UCMCTrack, a novel multi-object tracker that achieves state-of-the-art performance by modeling target motion on the ground plane instead of the image plane. A key innovation is the use of a standalone motion-based distance measure called Mapped Mahalanobis Distance (MMD) to associate targets across frames, completely replacing the conventional reliance on IoU overlap. Unlike traditional trackers, UCMCTrack handles camera motion by applying the same compensation parameters uniformly across the entire video sequence, rather than computing compensation on a per-frame basis. This is enabled by modeling target motion using a Kalman filter on the ground plane and introducing process noise parameters to account for uncertainties caused by the camera movement. Experiments demonstrate UCMCTrackâ€™s exceptional accuracy and speed exceeding 1000 FPS on multiple datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack and KITTI. The simplistic yet powerful design allows UCMCTrack to achieve impressive tracking performance solely based on motion cues, presenting new possibilities for advancing research in this domain.
