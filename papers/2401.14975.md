# [Embedding-based search in JetBrains IDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14975)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Embedding-based search in JetBrains IDEs":

Problem: 
Modern IDEs like JetBrains IDEs have a search feature to find files, actions, classes etc. across a project. However, the existing search relies on heuristics and regular expressions, without considering semantics. This limits its ability to handle synonyms, word permutations, typos etc.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose using an embedding-based search to improve search discoverability. They use a neural language model to generate vector representations of searchable items like file/class names, action names etc. and of search queries. During search, they calculate the cosine similarity between query and item embeddings to find most relevant results.

The embeddings are precomputed and stored to minimize search latency. They use a compact model with 2 linear layers for fast indexing while retaining accuracy. Dynamic similarity thresholds are used to decide search relevance on the fly. The search runs concurrently to standard search, with results appended later, avoiding delays.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstration of using embeddings for semantic search in desktop IDEs with tight latency constraints
- Compact neural model for indexing speed and storage efficiency 
- Techniques like concurrent search, dynamic thresholds etc. for low-latency real-time search
- Analysis of tradeoffs in model size, search quality, indexing duration
- Identification of future work like optimal contexts for embeddings, minimum context size etc.

In summary, the paper presents a novel embedding-based semantic search feature for IDEs to improve search relevance without compromising responsiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes an embedding-based search approach implemented in JetBrains IDEs to improve the discoverability of search items by accounting for semantics like synonyms, typos, and complex word permutations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper describes the machine learning approach implemented by the authors to improve the discoverability of search items in JetBrains IDEs. Specifically, they have implemented an embedding-based search method to enhance the existing search functionality in JetBrains IDEs called "Search Everywhere". The key aspects of their contribution are:

1) They compute vector representations of all searchable items (files, classes, methods, actions, etc.) in the project index using a compact neural language model. 

2) During search time, they calculate the cosine similarity between the vector representation of the search query and the precomputed vectors of index items to retrieve relevant results.

3) They optimize the neural model to balance the tradeoffs between search quality, indexing speed, and runtime memory requirements. Their final model can index projects with 100,000s of files in a few minutes.

4) They share the challenges faced in moving from a server-based to a local approach, optimizations like model quantization, and open questions to guide future work in this area.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient embedding-based search method that enhances existing functionality in JetBrains IDEs to improve search discoverability, along with a discussion of learnings and future directions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a bi-encoder Siamese architecture from Sentence-BERT. How exactly does this architecture work for encoding queries and search items separately? What are the advantages of this approach over other encoder architectures?

2. The paper compares several model architectures like MiniLM, SentenceBERT, and E5-small-v2. What are the key tradeoffs between these models in terms of inference speed, search quality, and storage requirements? Which one seems most suitable for real-time search in an IDE?

3. The method uses a single unified model for searching over all types of entities like files, classes, methods etc. What are the challenges in using a single model versus having specialized models for each entity type? How can the model be optimized to work well across different domains?

4. Table 2 shows that using the whole function body gives better search accuracy than just the name for methods. Why does this happen? Would a similar improvement be seen for other code entities like classes if the whole source was used? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The paper mentions converting models to ONNX format and using the KInference library for efficient execution. What are the key advantages of this approach? How does it help optimize latency and memory usage during search?

6. How exactly is the similarity threshold tuned based on the number of search results found? What metrics and techniques are used to dynamically adjust this threshold? Why is this beneficial?

7. What incremental indexing approaches were explored to handle real-time project changes efficiently? What are the alternatives for synchronizing changes without rewriting the whole embedding index file? 

8. How can we further optimize the storage requirements and access patterns for the embedding index file format? What compression and approximate nearest neighbor techniques could help?

9. The paper talks about employing gradient boosting ranking after the embedding search. How can this ranking model be trained to properly consider the cosine embedding similarity along with other features? What challenges need to be addressed?

10. What online evaluation approaches are being planned to compare against the offline quality metrics reported? What user studies or A/B tests can provide insight into real-world performance?
