# [Evaluating Biases in Context-Dependent Health Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper studies biases in large language models (LLMs) when answering underspecified, context-dependent health questions. The authors focus on sexual and reproductive health questions that require additional context about the user's age, sex, or location in order to be properly answered. They hypothesize that asking such contextual questions without providing the necessary context will reveal biases in the LLM's answers towards certain demographic groups.

The authors curate a dataset of 187 sexual and reproductive health questions from Planned Parenthood and Go Ask Alice websites. The questions are labeled as being dependent on age, sex, and/or location. They select representative ages, sexes (male/female), and liberal/conservative US states to study. 

The authors probe two chat-based LLMs (GPT-3.5 and LLaMA) with the questions, once without context and again providing context for each demographic group. They compare the similarity of each context-provided answer to the original context-less answer to quantify bias. Additionally, they have human annotators label which groups each original answer pertains to.

The results show biases favoring females, ages 18-30, and Massachusetts (a liberal state). The trends are consistent across metrics and LLMs. There is greater variance for locations but a remaining favoritism of Massachusetts.

The main contributions are: (1) curating a dataset of contextual health questions dependent on age, sex, and location; (2) methodology to probe biases through context manipulation; (3) demonstration of biases towards certain groups in chat-based LLMs for this underspecified context setting. The results emphasize the need to ensure equality in answers for critical domains like healthcare.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies biases in large language model responses to underspecified contextual questions in sexual and reproductive healthcare across different demographic groups based on age, sex, and location.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Alongside public health and gender studies experts, the authors create a dataset of sexual and reproductive public health contextual questions. Each question requires additional information that is dependent on age, location, and/or sex.

2) The authors investigate whether LLM responses favor certain demographic groups. Their results show biases towards specific groups in each attribute (female, ages 18-30, living in Massachusetts) that are consistent across the chat-based LLMs studied.

So in summary, the key contributions are creating a dataset of contextual health questions dependent on demographics, and demonstrating biases in LLM responses towards certain age, sex, and location groups using this dataset.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Contextual questions - The paper focuses on underspecified, context-dependent questions where additional demographic information is needed to provide a correct response.

- Healthcare biases - The authors evaluate how biases are exhibited in large language models' responses to contextual healthcare questions. 

- Sexual and reproductive health - The contextual questions curated relate specifically to topics in sexual and reproductive health.

- Demographic attributes - The questions depend on age, biological sex, and location attributes that provide necessary context.

- Group biases - Experiments reveal biases favoring certain demographic groups (young adult females, those living in Massachusetts) in the chatbot responses. 

- Chat-based language models - Biases are analyzed in two conversational AI systems: GPT-3.5 Turbo and LLaMA.

In summary, key concepts cover contextual questions, biases in AI healthcare responses, favored demographic groups, and analyses of chatbot systems. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper focuses on biases in context-dependent health questions. What are some examples of other domains where context-dependent questions could reveal harmful biases in language models?

2. The authors evaluate models by probing them with and without demographic context. What are some alternative or additional ways the authors could have evaluated biases in the models' responses?

3. The dataset contains questions dependent on age, sex, and location. What are some other types of demographic attributes that could be relevant contextual information for health questions?  

4. The authors evaluate groups within the sex, age, and location attributes. What criteria did they use to select the specific groups to study within each attribute? What are the limitations of the selected groups?

5. Both quantitative similarity metrics and human evaluation are used to analyze biases. What are the tradeoffs between these methodologies? In what ways do the human annotations complement the quantitative results?

6. The authors find more variation in location bias results compared to age and sex. What factors may explain this increased variation? How could the analysis of location bias be improved?

7. The paper analyzes English health questions from U.S.-based sources. How could the analysis be extended to other languages and healthcare systems? What new issues might arise?

8. The authors use cosine similarity to compare model outputs. What are some other semantic similarity metrics that could be used instead of or in conjunction with cosine similarity? What would using multiple metrics reveal?

9. For the human evaluation, healthcare professionals are hired to annotate the sex-based questions. What biases could this introduce? How else might the human evaluation be conducted?

10. The authors suggest model outputs could be improved with up-to-date external knowledge. What are some technical approaches for integrating real-time external knowledge into model inferences? What challenges arise with maintaining external knowledge?
