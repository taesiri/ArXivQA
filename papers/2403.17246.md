# [TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Classical planning formulations like PDDL admit action sequences that are guaranteed to achieve a goal state from an initial state. However, they do not capture temporal aspects of multi-agent action taking, where agents can execute actions simultaneously if their preconditions and postconditions do not interfere.  
- Multi-agent PDDL planning introduces an exponential growth in the search space over possible plans.
- Large language models (LLMs) can infer plan steps using commonsense reasoning but lose the success guarantees of classical planners.

Proposed Solution:
- Combine strengths of classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. 
- Decompose goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent a subgoal.  
- Use LLM to generate a "helper" agent's subgoal in natural language. Translate this to PDDL format.
- Plan for "main" agent using single-agent PDDL with helper's subgoal state as initial state.
- Execute multi-agent plan with partial parallelism.

Key Contributions:
- Show that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL directly, while achieving fewer execution steps than a single agent plan.
- Preserve correctness guarantees of classical planning while utilizing commonsense reasoning of LLMs.  
- Demonstrate that LLM-approximations of subgoals can achieve similar performance as subgoals specified by human experts.
- Approach works on symbolic planning domains as well as simulated domains without needing domain-specific temporal reasoning.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel method to effectively utilize both classical planning techniques and recent advances in large language models for practical multi-agent planning.
