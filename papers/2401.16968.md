# [Distinguishing Fictional Voices: a Study of Authorship Verification   Models for Quotation Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Attributing quotes to characters in novels is important for literary analysis, but challenging. Current approaches focus on local context rather than general character information. 
- Little prior work has explored stylistic representations of characters for quotation attribution.

Methodology:
- Use off-the-shelf pretrained authorship verification models to encode quotes spoken by each character. Pool representations to build character embeddings capturing stylistic and/or semantic information.
- Formulate quote attribution as an authorship verification task - evaluate if character embeddings are more similar to quotes spoken by that character versus other characters.
- Test on Project Dialogism Novel Corpus with 28 English novels. Build character representations from quotes in one chapter, evaluate on held-out chapters.

Experiments:
- Compare semantic-only baseline, style-only model, emotion model, and model with both semantics and style.
- Evaluate both ability to distinguish between characters (Character-Character) and attribute quotes (Character-Quote)
- Also test impact of only using explicit quotes linked to character names.

Key Findings:
- Combining semantics and style best distinguishes between characters
- Semantic-only baseline best for quote attribution  
- Explicit quotes alone can distinguish characters in many cases
- Impact varies across novels - style helps more for some books

Contributions:
- First use of authorship verification for character style analysis at scale
- Analysis of distinction between explicit and implicit characterization 
- Findings on complementarity of style and semantic information for quote attribution

The paper demonstrates the promise of stylistic representations, but more interpretability and literary-specific modeling is needed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates using authorship verification models to create stylistic representations of literary characters in novels and evaluates their ability to distinguish character voices and attribute quotes, finding that models encoding both semantic and stylistic information perform best at distinguishing voices while semantic-only models are better for quotation attribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors investigate recent neural authorship verification models for the study of characters in novels and benchmark them on their ability to attribute authorship for distinguishing character voices in a large corpus.

2. Framing quote attribution as an authorship verification task, the authors evaluate the usefulness of stylometric character representations encoded by pretrained authorship verification models to attribute quotes to characters.

So in summary, the main contributions are applying authorship verification models to distinguish character voices and evaluate their usefulness for quote attribution in novels. The key idea is to leverage stylometric information about characters captured by these models to help with the quote attribution task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Quotation attribution - The task of attributing a quote or utterance of direct speech to the character who said it. This is a key focus of the paper.

- Authorship verification - Framing the problem of distinguishing between characters' voices and attributing quotes to them as an authorship verification task. The paper leverages authorship verification models.

- Character representations - Building vector representations of literary characters by encoding all the quotes they say using transformer models. Analyzing if these representations can help distinguish between characters.

- Stylometry - Using stylistic information like writing style patterns to characterize and distinguish between literary characters based on their speech. The paper analyzes if stylometric models can capture character voices.

- Semantics - The paper also evaluates semantic-only models that encode topical information in the quotes to distinguish between characters.

- Explicit quotes - Quotes that directly mention the character speaking them. The paper specifically looks at using explicit quotes to build character representations.

Some other terms: polyphony, multi-label emotion classification, cosine similarity, AUC.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper builds character representations by encoding quotes with pretrained models. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using contextual information or narrative text surrounding the quotes?

2. The paper evaluates the models on their ability to distinguish between voices of characters. What other evaluation metrics could be used to assess the quality of the character representations? 

3. The authorship verification task is used as a framework to evaluate the models. What are other relevant NLP tasks that could be formulated to evaluate the usefulness of character representations?

4. The paper hypothesizes that explicit quotes are a good proxy for a character's overall voice. What analysis could be done to further validate this hypothesis? 

5. The LUAR model combines semantic and stylistic information and performs the best on distinguishing voices. What modifications could be made to disentangle and quantify the separate contributions of semantic and stylistic information?

6. The paper observes semantic variations between explicit and other types of quotes. What analysis could be conducted on the semantic content of different quote types to characterize these variations?  

7. The standard deviations of results across novels are very high. What qualitative analysis could be done to understand which novel characteristics impact model performances?

8. Minor characters are discarded from the analysis. Would including them provide further insights on how distinctiveness of voices varies with character importance?

9. The paper uses off-the-shelf models trained on non-literary data. How could the models be adapted to better capture stylistic patterns specific to literature and avoid poor domain transfer?

10. The character representations do not use contextual information. How could contextual information surrounding quotes be incorporated to enrich the representations?
