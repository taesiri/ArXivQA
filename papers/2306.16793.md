# [Benchmarking Large Language Model Capabilities for Conditional   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1) How do different model architectures compare in terms of automatic metrics for conditional natural language generation tasks?2) What set of tasks, methods, and metrics is best suited for monitoring improvements in language generation capabilities of models? 3) What are the broader implications for how the quality of newly developed models should be monitored and evaluated?The paper seems to focus on benchmarking and evaluating large language models on a diverse set of conditional NLG tasks. The main goal appears to be developing best practices and recommendations for model evaluation in language generation settings. The authors compare different model architectures like decoder-only models vs encoder-decoders across various datasets and metrics. They also analyze few-shot vs finetuning approaches and study the impact of scale, input context length etc. A key aspect seems to be trying to determine evaluation protocols and subsets of tasks/metrics that can efficiently and reliably monitor progress in language generation capabilities. The paper aims to derive lessons from this comprehensive empirical study to guide future NLG model development and evaluation.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we reliably benchmark and monitor the natural language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs)?The authors aim to define a methodology to evaluate and compare LLMs on their ability to generate natural language text conditioned on some input. They want to understand how factors like model scale, architecture, training data, etc. affect performance on conditional generation tasks. Specifically, the paper seems to focus on answering three key research questions:1. How do different model architectures compare in terms of automatic metrics on conditional generation tasks? 2. What set of tasks, methods, and metrics is best suited for monitoring improvements in language generation capabilities?3. What are the broader implications for how the quality of newly developed models should be evaluated and monitored?The main hypothesis appears to be that careful selection of datasets, evaluation methods, and metrics can enable fair benchmarking and tracking of progress in conditional text generation for LLMs. The paper provides an empirical study and recommendations to standardize LLM evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a large-scale empirical evaluation of different pretrained language models (PLMs) on a diverse set of multilingual natural language generation tasks. The key findings are:- Few-shot learning generally lags behind finetuning performance, with the gap increasing for more complex tasks. However, few-shot can still provide insights, especially on simpler data-to-text tasks. - Large decoder-only PLMs like PaLM and GPT-3.5 can match or exceed the performance of smaller encoder-decoders like T5 after finetuning, demonstrating the benefits of scale.- Multilingual generation capabilities are highly dependent on the pretraining data. Models pretrained mostly on English like PaLM struggle with non-English generation compared to mT5 which was pretrained on a multilingual corpus.- Long input tasks benefit from architectures that can handle longer contexts like LongT5, even if the model is smaller.- Model rankings can be produced with high confidence using only a sample of a few hundred examples per task, reducing computational costs.- Automated metrics like ROUGE have high correlation at the system-level but can vary significantly for individual examples.The paper concludes with recommendations on best practices for evaluating and comparing PLMs on generation tasks, such as using simple few-shot prompts, evaluating on diverse tasks, and carefully selecting metrics and evaluation sets. The goal is to enable more standardized PLM benchmarking during training and development.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a large-scale empirical evaluation of different pretrained language models (PLMs) on a diverse set of multilingual conditional natural language generation tasks. The key aspects are:- Evaluating 8 models with different architectures (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder), scales (8B to 540B parameters), and pretraining data (mostly English vs multilingual corpus) on 27 generation tasks in 14 languages. - Comparing few-shot learning and finetuning approaches.- Analyzing the results to determine which tasks, methods, and metrics are best suited for evaluating and monitoring progress in conditional text generation capabilities of models. - Deriving best practices and recommendations for model evaluation based on the empirical findings, such as using small evaluation sets rather than full test sets to save compute and using both automatic metrics and human evaluation.- Providing the first large-scale conditional generation benchmark for recent PLMs. Prior work evaluated models like GPT-3 mainly on question answering instead of free-form text generation.- Showing that scale and architecture affect few-shot vs finetuning performance, and pretraining corpus language coverage impacts multilingual generation quality.Overall, the paper aims to develop methodologies and insights to improve evaluation and monitoring of text generation capabilities in PLMs through extensive empirical analysis. The recommendations could help guide future work to assess generation quality more robustly and efficiently.
