# [Benchmarking Large Language Model Capabilities for Conditional   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1) How do different model architectures compare in terms of automatic metrics for conditional natural language generation tasks?2) What set of tasks, methods, and metrics is best suited for monitoring improvements in language generation capabilities of models? 3) What are the broader implications for how the quality of newly developed models should be monitored and evaluated?The paper seems to focus on benchmarking and evaluating large language models on a diverse set of conditional NLG tasks. The main goal appears to be developing best practices and recommendations for model evaluation in language generation settings. The authors compare different model architectures like decoder-only models vs encoder-decoders across various datasets and metrics. They also analyze few-shot vs finetuning approaches and study the impact of scale, input context length etc. A key aspect seems to be trying to determine evaluation protocols and subsets of tasks/metrics that can efficiently and reliably monitor progress in language generation capabilities. The paper aims to derive lessons from this comprehensive empirical study to guide future NLG model development and evaluation.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we reliably benchmark and monitor the natural language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs)?The authors aim to define a methodology to evaluate and compare LLMs on their ability to generate natural language text conditioned on some input. They want to understand how factors like model scale, architecture, training data, etc. affect performance on conditional generation tasks. Specifically, the paper seems to focus on answering three key research questions:1. How do different model architectures compare in terms of automatic metrics on conditional generation tasks? 2. What set of tasks, methods, and metrics is best suited for monitoring improvements in language generation capabilities?3. What are the broader implications for how the quality of newly developed models should be evaluated and monitored?The main hypothesis appears to be that careful selection of datasets, evaluation methods, and metrics can enable fair benchmarking and tracking of progress in conditional text generation for LLMs. The paper provides an empirical study and recommendations to standardize LLM evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a large-scale empirical evaluation of different pretrained language models (PLMs) on a diverse set of multilingual natural language generation tasks. The key findings are:- Few-shot learning generally lags behind finetuning performance, with the gap increasing for more complex tasks. However, few-shot can still provide insights, especially on simpler data-to-text tasks. - Large decoder-only PLMs like PaLM and GPT-3.5 can match or exceed the performance of smaller encoder-decoders like T5 after finetuning, demonstrating the benefits of scale.- Multilingual generation capabilities are highly dependent on the pretraining data. Models pretrained mostly on English like PaLM struggle with non-English generation compared to mT5 which was pretrained on a multilingual corpus.- Long input tasks benefit from architectures that can handle longer contexts like LongT5, even if the model is smaller.- Model rankings can be produced with high confidence using only a sample of a few hundred examples per task, reducing computational costs.- Automated metrics like ROUGE have high correlation at the system-level but can vary significantly for individual examples.The paper concludes with recommendations on best practices for evaluating and comparing PLMs on generation tasks, such as using simple few-shot prompts, evaluating on diverse tasks, and carefully selecting metrics and evaluation sets. The goal is to enable more standardized PLM benchmarking during training and development.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a large-scale empirical evaluation of different pretrained language models (PLMs) on a diverse set of multilingual conditional natural language generation tasks. The key aspects are:- Evaluating 8 models with different architectures (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder), scales (8B to 540B parameters), and pretraining data (mostly English vs multilingual corpus) on 27 generation tasks in 14 languages. - Comparing few-shot learning and finetuning approaches.- Analyzing the results to determine which tasks, methods, and metrics are best suited for evaluating and monitoring progress in conditional text generation capabilities of models. - Deriving best practices and recommendations for model evaluation based on the empirical findings, such as using small evaluation sets rather than full test sets to save compute and using both automatic metrics and human evaluation.- Providing the first large-scale conditional generation benchmark for recent PLMs. Prior work evaluated models like GPT-3 mainly on question answering instead of free-form text generation.- Showing that scale and architecture affect few-shot vs finetuning performance, and pretraining corpus language coverage impacts multilingual generation quality.Overall, the paper aims to develop methodologies and insights to improve evaluation and monitoring of text generation capabilities in PLMs through extensive empirical analysis. The recommendations could help guide future work to assess generation quality more robustly and efficiently.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper provides one of the most comprehensive empirical benchmarks of large language model capabilities for conditional natural language generation. Many prior works evaluating large language models focus primarily on classification/NLU tasks rather than full text generation. This paper helps fill that gap.- The scale of the evaluation in terms of number of models, tasks, and languages benchmarked is quite large compared to prior work. For example, the recent LaMDA and PaLM papers evaluated on fewer conditional generation tasks. - The analysis of different training regimes (few-shot vs finetuning), model architectures (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder), and metrics provides useful insights into model capabilities that goes beyond just reporting scores. - The recommendations on evaluation practices are helpful for standardizing future benchmarking of language generation tasks. This type of methodological contribution is still relatively rare.- Compared to some other analyses, this paper does not do much in terms of probing/diagnosing model capabilities or analyzing specific model errors. The focus is more on benchmarking established datasets and metrics.- The multilingual assessment provides useful insights into cross-lingual generalization. This analysis is still not as comprehensive as dedicated multilingual benchmarks like XTREME, but provides a good conditional generation perspective.- The study of how performance correlates with dataset size could help make future evaluation more efficient. Analyzing metric correlation and agreement is also an important methodological contribution.Overall, this paper pushes forward the state of empirical evaluation for large language models by providing breadth, scale, and methodological insights that go beyond most prior conditional generation studies. The recommendations could help standardize and improve future benchmarking.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on evaluating large language models (LLMs):- Scope of evaluation: This paper provides one of the most extensive evaluations to date of LLMs on conditional natural language generation tasks, covering 8 models on 27 tasks across 14 languages. Many prior works focus on a smaller set of models or tasks.- Few-shot vs finetuning: The paper thoroughly examines both few-shot and finetuning approaches for the various models, shedding light on their relative strengths. Most prior work looked at either few-shot or finetuning evaluation, but not both. - Automated metrics analysis: The paper deeply analyzes different automated metrics like ROUGE, BLEURT, ChrF for evaluating few-shot and finetuned generations. It finds good metric correlations on aggregate but issues with individual segments.- Multilinguality: A key contribution is the multilingual evaluation, since most prior benchmarks focus on English. This reveals important differences in crosslingual vs monolingual performance.- Efficiency: The paper investigates how to efficiently evaluate models, finding that 500 examples are often sufficient for model ranking. This could make LLM evaluation more feasible.- Limitations: The paper transparently discusses limitations around determining why models succeed, generalizing beyond tested tasks, and claiming real-world utility without human evaluation.Overall, the scope and rigor of the empirical evaluation, along with analysis of metrics and efficiency, sets this work apart from prior LLM evaluations and provides valuable insights into assessing generation capabilities. The recommendations could significantly improve LLM benchmarking.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests the following future research directions:- Expanding the set of tasks, methods, and metrics evaluated to cover a broader range of natural language generation capabilities. They recommend including more diverse data-to-text and text-to-text tasks, as well as incorporating methods like prompt tuning and chain-of-thought prompting. - Exploring whether the findings generalize to other autoregressive models besides the ones benchmarked in the paper. The authors recommend evaluating models like GPT-3, Bloom, and Megatron to see if similar patterns emerge.- Developing more robust few-shot evaluation methodologies to enable fairer comparisons between models. This includes strategies to avoid overfitting to prompts and better handle varying output lengths.- Further analyzing the tradeoffs between evaluation set size, number of tasks, and metric reliability. The authors suggest developing portfolio approaches that evaluate many tasks with smaller test sets to hedge against individual dataset risk.- Conducting human evaluations on subsets of the data to better understand real-world language generation quality. The paper acknowledges automatic metrics have limitations in capturing usefulness.- Evaluating model performance on downstream applications to complement intrinsic benchmarks. This would provide insights into how conditional generation capabilities translate to real-world utility.- Studying social impacts like toxicity, bias, and hallucinations that can arise in open-ended generation. The authors note evaluation of these factors is crucial.In summary, the key suggested directions are expanding the breadth of tasks, models, and methods evaluated; improving few-shot evaluation and metrics; more efficiently balancing evaluation costs; and complementing automatic metrics with human assessments and application-based evaluations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Develop more sophisticated few-shot learning methods for conditional natural language generation tasks. The authors found that few-shot learning lagged significantly behind finetuning for many generation tasks. They suggest exploring ways to improve few-shot learning for these tasks, such as through more advanced prompting techniques. - Design conditional generation benchmarks and metrics better suited for evaluating large language models. The authors discuss challenges with using existing datasets and metrics for evaluating the generation capabilities of large pretrained language models. They recommend developing new benchmarks and metrics tailored for these models.- Study transfer learning and generalization across languages more thoroughly. The results showed language generation capabilities are highly dependent on the pretraining data. The authors suggest further research on cross-lingual transfer and how to best leverage multilingual pretraining data.- Evaluate model performance more efficiently. The authors recommend evaluating models on smaller subsets of diverse tasks rather than always using full datasets to reduce computational costs. They also suggest better understanding the relationship between different automatic metrics.- Develop more holistic evaluation practices beyond automatic metrics. The authors emphasize that automatic metrics have limitations and cannot fully assess model utility. They suggest complementing automatic evaluations with human evaluations and extrinsic testing.- Evaluate environmental impact and model efficiency. The authors point out the high computational costs of training and evaluating large language models. They recommend explicit reporting of compute usage and encourage developing more efficient methods.In summary, the main suggestions are to develop better few-shot learning techniques, design more suitable benchmarks and metrics, thoroughly study cross-lingual capabilities, evaluate models more efficiently, go beyond automatic metrics, and consider environmental impact. The overarching goal is to improve evaluation practices to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of large pretrained language models for generation tasks.
