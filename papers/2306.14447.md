# [RoboCook: Long-Horizon Elasto-Plastic Object Manipulation with Diverse   Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: how can robots learn to perceive, model, and manipulate deformable objects over long horizons using diverse tools, without relying on pre-defined physics-based simulators? The key points are:- The paper focuses on long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks that require using multiple tools sequentially, such as making dumplings from dough. This poses challenges in discrete tool selection and continuous motion planning.- The authors develop a system called \model that enables robots to learn complex tool-object interaction dynamics from visual observations and real-world interaction data. - \model combines learned dynamics models with tool classification and self-supervised policy learning to manipulate deformable objects over long horizons using different tools.- The main hypothesis is that with \model's data-driven modeling approach, robots can learn to perform complex, long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks with diverse tools purely from real-world interactions, without relying on manually designed simulators.In summary, the central research question is how to enable robots to perform long-horizon, multi-step deformable object manipulation using diverse tools in the real world, by learning models and policies from interaction data rather than pre-defined simulators. The \model system is proposed to address this question.
