# [RoboCook: Long-Horizon Elasto-Plastic Object Manipulation with Diverse   Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: how can robots learn to perceive, model, and manipulate deformable objects over long horizons using diverse tools, without relying on pre-defined physics-based simulators? The key points are:- The paper focuses on long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks that require using multiple tools sequentially, such as making dumplings from dough. This poses challenges in discrete tool selection and continuous motion planning.- The authors develop a system called \model that enables robots to learn complex tool-object interaction dynamics from visual observations and real-world interaction data. - \model combines learned dynamics models with tool classification and self-supervised policy learning to manipulate deformable objects over long horizons using different tools.- The main hypothesis is that with \model's data-driven modeling approach, robots can learn to perform complex, long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks with diverse tools purely from real-world interactions, without relying on manually designed simulators.In summary, the central research question is how to enable robots to perform long-horizon, multi-step deformable object manipulation using diverse tools in the real world, by learning models and policies from interaction data rather than pre-defined simulators. The \model system is proposed to address this question.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: The paper proposes RoboCook, a framework that enables robots to manipulate deformable objects over long horizons using different tools, by modeling tool-object interactions with graph neural networks learned from visual observations and combining tool classification with self-supervised policy learning to plan effective manipulation actions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several notable contributions to the field of deformable object manipulation with tools:- It proposes a complete system for long-horizon manipulation of elasto-plastic objects using multiple tools. Most prior work has focused on short-horizon tasks with a single tool. The system includes perception, dynamics modeling, tool selection, and policy learning components.- It learns tool-object interaction dynamics from real-world data using graph neural networks. This data-driven approach avoids the challenges and inaccuracies of analytic physical simulators for deformable objects.- It introduces a method for tool selection by classifying the most suitable tool for a given task stage based on current and goal observations. This helps enable long-horizon tasks that require sequencing multiple tools. - It combines the tool selection module with learned dynamics models and a self-supervised policy to achieve reactive planning and control. The policy is trained efficiently on synthetic data.- It demonstrates the approach on complex tasks like making dumplings and shaping letter cookies, which require coordinating multiple tools over long horizons. The method shows strong performance compared to planning baselines.Overall, this work pushes the state-of-the-art in tool-based deformable object manipulation by tackling long-horizon tasks, learning dynamics from real data, and integrating tool selection with policy learning. The evaluations on cooking tasks demonstrate the promise for real-world robotic manipulation. The data-driven dynamics learning and modular system design are significant advances towards more general and capable deformable object manipulation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion:1. Design an automatic error correction system to handle occasional failures like dough sticking to tools.2. Remove the reliance on human priors for tool action spaces by developing methods to automatically determine optimal action spaces. However, they note that their current simplifications do not constrain generalization.3. Develop higher-level temporal abstraction and task-level planning to eliminate the need for predefined subgoals. Currently subgoals are defined by humans.4. Add capabilities for estimating topology to handle cables, cloths, etc. Currently RoboCook is focused on elasto-plastic objects like dough.5. Improve performance on tasks like alphabet letter shaping that require very precise manipulation.6. Explore transferring the system to other types of deformable materials like cloth or cable manipulation.7. Investigate fully closed-loop control without predefined subgoals.8. Develop methods to automatically determine tools and skills needed for new tasks.In summary, the main future directions focus on making the system more autonomous by eliminating reliance on human priors/subgoals, improving precision, handling more deformable materials, more complex tasks, and fully closed-loop control. The core RoboCook system provides a strong foundation for researching these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes RoboCook, a framework to enable robots to perceive, model, and manipulate elasto-plastic objects like dough using various tools for complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. RoboCook uses point cloud scene representations and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn highly complex interactions between the soft object and tools purely from visual observations of about 20 minutes of real-world interaction data per tool. It combines a tool classification module with the learned dynamics models to determine the best tool to use at each task stage. It also uses a self-supervised policy trained on synthetic data from the dynamics model to plan optimal trajectories for the selected tool. RoboCook is shown to effectively accomplish complex tasks like making dumplings and shaping alphabet letter cookies out of dough. It exhibits robustness to disturbances and generalizability to new materials without retraining. The key innovations are the tool-aware GNNs for modeling long-horizon dynamics, the tool classification module for learning tool functions, and the self-supervised policy framework for efficient planning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a framework called \model for long-horizon soft body manipulation using multiple tools. The task involves challenges at both the discrete level of tool selection and the continuous level of motion planning. To address these challenges, \model introduces three main contributions: (1) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used to learn complex interactions between the dough and tools from visual observations. (2) A tool classification module is combined with the learned dynamics models to select the most appropriate tool for each subtask. (3) A self-supervised policy is trained on synthetic data from the dynamics model for efficient planning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate \model's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. It can make complex foods like dumplings by intelligently choosing and operating the right tools at each stage. Even with severe external perturbations by a human, it adapts reactively and completes the dumpling. \model also generalizes well to tasks like shaping alphabet letter cookies without additional training. Compared to strong baselines, it achieves superior performance in both geometric and human evaluation metrics. The learned policy enables efficient planning, taking only seconds versus minutes for other methods. Overall, this work provides an important step towards building adaptable robotic systems that can manipulate deformable objects over long horizons using diverse tools.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a robotic system called \model that can perceive, model, and manipulate elasto-plastic objects like dough using various tools to accomplish long-horizon manipulation tasks. The system uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn complex interactions between the soft object and tools from visual observations of real-world interaction data. It combines this learned dynamics model with a PointNet-based tool classifier to select the appropriate tool to use at each stage of a task. The system also utilizes a self-supervised policy network trained on synthetic data from the dynamics model to plan optimal trajectories for the selected tool. In this way, \model can learn complex long-horizon dough manipulation skills like making dumplings purely from its own real-world physical interactions, without reliance on expert demonstrations, simulations or analytically modeled dynamics. The method is shown to be effective, robust and generalizable through experiments on dumpling and alphabet letter cookie making.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the challenge of enabling robots to manipulate deformable objects like dough using tools, over long time horizons. Specifically, it tackles three key problems in robotics:1. Deformable object manipulation: Manipulating soft, deformable objects like dough is very difficult for robots due to the complexity of modeling and controlling the high degrees of freedom and non-linear dynamics. 2. Long-horizon planning: Long manipulation tasks like making dumplings require reasoning over long time horizons and choosing appropriate tools/actions at each stage. This type of hierarchical planning is challenging.3. Tool use: Using diverse tools appropriately to manipulate objects requires understanding the interactions between tools and objects. Tool use has been limited in autonomous robots.The key question is how to enable robots to perform complex, long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects by flexibly using different tools, with minimal reliance on hand-engineered models or simulators. The paper proposes an end-to-end framework called RoboCook that learns to perceive, model, and control soft body manipulation using various tools directly from visual observations and physical interaction.
