# [Unraveling Key Factors of Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08585)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the interplay between student model capacity, data complexity, and decoding strategies and their impact on the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in neural machine translation (NMT). Through extensive experiments on datasets like IWSLT13 En→Fr, IWSLT14 En→De, and others, the authors systematically analyze how these factors influence both word-level and sequence-level distillation. Key findings show that while increasing student model capacity improves distillation performance, there are diminishing returns at higher capacities. Additionally, higher data complexity and noise detrimentally impact distillation effectiveness, with sequence-level distillation demonstrating more resilience. The paper also evaluates different decoding methods, finding beam search most effective overall. By elucidating these nuances, the research provides guidance on optimizing model design and training procedures to enhance the distillation process in NMT. The methods proposed achieve state-of-the-art results on the IWSLT14 De→En translation task, highlighting their practical value.
