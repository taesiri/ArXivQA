# [Ego-Only: Egocentric Action Detection without Exocentric Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01380)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is whether effective action detection on egocentric (first-person) videos can be achieved without relying on transferring from exocentric (third-person) data. 

The key points are:

- Prior work has assumed that large-scale exocentric pretraining and transferring is necessary for good egocentric action detection, due to the lack of sufficient labeled egocentric data. 

- However, the authors argue that the large viewpoint differences between ego- and exocentric videos pose challenges that may not be easily addressed by just scaling up exocentric data/labels or designing better transfer techniques.

- They hypothesize that with recent advances like masked autoencoders and growth of egocentric datasets, it may be possible to train egocentric models effectively from scratch, without exocentric transferring.

- They propose a simple "Ego-Only" approach involving MAE pretraining and temporal segmentation fine-tuning only on egocentric data.

- Through experiments on major egocentric datasets, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance without any exocentric supervision, validating that exocentric transfer may not be necessary.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that with proper techniques, egocentric action detection can achieve strong performance using ego-only data, without relying on exocentric transfer. The paper aims to revisit this assumption and demonstrate the possibilities of ego-only learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the first method (Ego-Only) that enables training egocentric action detection models without relying on any exocentric (third-person viewpoint) data or models. 

2. It shows that exocentric pretraining/transferring is not necessary to achieve state-of-the-art results on egocentric action detection datasets like Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego. The proposed Ego-Only method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches that use exocentric transferring.

3. It systematically studies and reveals several important factors for effectively training egocentric models without exocentric supervision, through extensive experiments and ablation studies. These factors include the importance of masked autoencoder pretraining, finetuning via temporal segmentation, modeling long-term context, scaling pretraining data, etc.

4. It sets new state-of-the-art results on egocentric action detection and recognition tasks on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100 and Charades-Ego datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Ego-Only approach.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and showing the viability of a simple but effective Ego-Only framework for egocentric action detection that does not rely on any exocentric data or models, contrary to most prior works. The paper also provides useful insights into training egocentric models effectively.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an "Ego-Only" approach for egocentric action detection that achieves state-of-the-art results without relying on transferring from large-scale exocentric datasets, demonstrating that exocentric pretraining may not be necessary despite its widespread use.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of egocentric action detection:

- It proposes an "ego-only" approach that does not rely on transferring models pretrained on exocentric (third-person viewpoint) video datasets, which has been the common practice. This is novel as most prior work has focused on improving transferring techniques from exocentric to egocentric video domains.

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on major egocentric video datasets like Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego without any exocentric pretraining. This suggests exocentric pretraining may not be necessary for egocentric action detection, contrary to what was previously believed.

- It takes a simple and straightforward approach of pretrained masked autoencoding (MAE) + finetuning via temporal segmentation on egocentric data. This contrasts with prior work combining multiple complex techniques like distillation, dataset alignment, multi-task learning etc. for transferring.

- It demonstrates the importance of pretraining on in-domain (egocentric) versus out-of-domain (exocentric) data. Models pretrained on exocentric data do not transfer as effectively as those pretrained on egocentric data, despite the larger dataset sizes.

- It reveals several key factors for effective egocentric representation learning like importance of long-term modeling, sensitivity to pretraining data amount, and lack of gains from joint ego-exo training.

Overall, this paper makes a strong case for an ego-only approach by showing pretrained MAE models finetuned on egocentric data can outperform complex multi-stage transferring techniques relying on large exocentric datasets. It provides novel insights into egocentric action detection.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring better methods for handling class imbalance in egocentric videos during training. The authors mention that the long-tail class distribution and imbalanced action lengths pose challenges. They mitigate this simply by reweighting losses, but suggest exploring more advanced techniques.

- Scaling up self-supervised pretraining with even more unlabeled egocentric video data. The authors show performance gains as they scale up the amount of unlabeled pretraining data. They suggest further exploration by pretraining on even larger unlabeled egocentric video datasets. 

- Studying joint ego-exo pretraining and finetuning in more depth. The authors try simple joint pretraining and finetuning with exocentric data but find limited gains. They suggest investigating techniques to better leverage both ego and exo data together.

- Applying the Ego-Only approach to additional egocentric perception tasks beyond action detection/recognition, such as hand segmentation, gaze detection, etc. The authors propose Ego-Only as a general egocentric learning paradigm not limited to a specific task.

- Exploring more advanced temporal modeling techniques tailored for egocentric videos, potentially with ideas from transformers, graph networks, etc. The authors use a simple technique of temporal segmentation but suggest exploring more sophisticated temporal modeling.

- Scaling up Ego-Only with larger models and datasets as they become available in the future. The authors establish strong baselines and suggest scaling up the approach.

In summary, the main directions are around scaling data, models, and techniques for handling unique properties of the egocentric domain, as well as combining insights from exocentric learning. The authors position Ego-Only as a general paradigm for egocentric perception.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Ego-Only, the first approach that enables state-of-the-art action detection on egocentric videos without relying on exocentric transferring. Previous methods transferred representations from large-scale third-person datasets, but the authors argue that the viewpoint differences make this challenging. Instead, Ego-Only consists of three simple stages: masked autoencoder pretraining on the target egocentric dataset, finetuning the features on a proxy task of temporal segmentation, and standard training of an off-the-shelf temporal action detector. Evaluated on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego, Ego-Only achieves new state-of-the-art results on both detection and recognition, outperforming prior work that uses orders of magnitude more exocentric supervision. Ablations reveal the importance of each stage and show that joint ego-exo training does not improve over the simple ego-only approach. The authors demonstrate that large-scale exocentric transferring is not necessary for top egocentric action detection performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ego-only approach for egocentric action detection that does not rely on any exocentric (third-person) transferring, which has been the common practice. The method consists of three stages: 1) Masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining on unlabeled egocentric videos to learn general visual representations. 2) Finetuning the model with a temporal segmentation task on egocentric datasets to adapt the features specifically for egocentric action detection. 3) Using the finetuned model as a frozen feature extractor and training an off-the-shelf temporal action localization method on top. 

The ego-only approach is evaluated on major egocentric video datasets including Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens and Charades-Ego for both action detection and recognition. Without using any exocentric data, the approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks, outperforming prior methods that rely on large-scale supervised exocentric pretraining and transfer. Ablation studies reveal the importance of the MAE pretraining and finetuning stages, and show performance gains as the amount of unlabeled egocentric data increases. The results demonstrate that exocentric transferring is not necessary for egocentric action detection if models are properly pretrained on in-domain data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an "Ego-Only" approach for egocentric action detection that does not rely on transferring representations from exocentric (third-person) videos. The key ideas are:

The method trains video representations using a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on ego-only data. This captures useful self-supervised features tailored to the egocentric domain. The MAE features are then finetuned via a temporal segmentation task to predict action labels at each frame on ego videos. This serves as a proxy task to adapt the features towards action detection. Finally, the finetuned features are extracted and frozen, then fed into an off-the-shelf temporal action localization method to detect actions in long videos. 

The overall pipeline enables training an effective egocentric action detection model without any exocentric pretraining, transferring, or labels. It shows strong results surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods relying on large-scale exocentric supervision. The approach demonstrates that transferring exocentric knowledge may not be necessary given recent advances in representation learning and growth of ego video datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper addresses the problem of action detection in egocentric (first-person) videos. This is an underexplored problem compared to third-person action detection.  

- A major challenge is the lack of large-scale egocentric video datasets to train high-capacity models. Current methods rely on pretraining on third-person (exocentric) video datasets and transferring to the egocentric domain. 

- The paper argues there are significant differences between ego- and exocentric videos (viewpoint, content, class granularity, etc.) that make transferring knowledge challenging.

- The paper proposes an "Ego-Only" approach to train egocentric action detection models using only egocentric video data, without any exocentric pretraining or transferring.

- The Ego-Only method uses a masked autoencoder for pretraining, followed by finetuning via temporal segmentation on ego videos. An off-the-shelf action detector is then applied.

- Ego-Only achieves state-of-the-art results on major ego video datasets, outperforming prior work relying on large labeled exocentric datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is showing egocentric action detection can be effectively learned without dependence on exocentric video datasets, by using a simple pretraining and finetuning approach tailored for the ego domain.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents Ego-Only, a novel method for egocentric action detection and recognition that achieves state-of-the-art performance without relying on any exocentric (third-person) data. Motivated by the large domain gap between egocentric and exocentric videos, the authors propose training models using only egocentric data. Ego-Only consists of masked autoencoder pretraining, finetuning via temporal segmentation on egocentric videos, and training an off-the-shelf action detector on the finetuned features.
