# [Tokenization counts: the impact of tokenization on arithmetic in   frontier LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Tokenization is an important but often overlooked part of the large language model (LLM) pipeline. Different tokenization strategies for numbers can impart different inductive biases in models. 
- Many recent LLMs are moving to single-digit tokens for numbers, but GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 use a mix of 1-, 2-, and 3-digit number tokens. This paper studies the effect of this choice on arithmetic reasoning.

Methods 
- The authors evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on addition problems with numbers 7-9 digits long. 
- They vary the tokenization direction: default left-to-right (L2R) versus right-to-left (R2L) enforced by comma separation. 
- They conduct detailed error analysis to understand performance differences.

Key Findings
- R2L tokenization leads to ~20% higher accuracy over L2R.
- L2R tokenization leads to very stereotyped "digit 4" errors when the answer is longer than the addends.
- Models can self-correct issues with L2R tokenization if prompted to repeat the problem in R2L format before answering.
- Tokenization-dependent effects persist in newer model versions, but become less prominent in larger models.

Main Contributions
- First thorough demonstration that number tokenization significantly impacts arithmetic reasoning in LLMs.
- Detailed error analysis revealing systematic patterns based on tokenization.
- Effective prompting strategy to mitigate issues.
- Benchmarking various model versions shows effects diminish but persist with scale.

Overall the paper makes a compelling case that number tokenization is an overlooked source of inductive bias in LLMs that can strongly influence numerical reasoning abilities. The authors provide guidance to practitioners on tokenization choices and methods to overcome detrimental biases introduced by some schemes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the impact of different number tokenization schemes on the ability of large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to perform arithmetic reasoning, finding significant performance differences between left-to-right and right-to-left tokenization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic study of how number tokenization choices in large language models lead to differences in performance on arithmetic tasks. Specifically, the paper:

- Compares left-to-right (L2R) vs right-to-left (R2L) number tokenization in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, finding that R2L tokenization leads to significantly higher accuracy on addition problems. 

- Provides a detailed error analysis, revealing stereotyped patterns such as models always getting a specific digit wrong in certain conditions with L2R tokenization. This suggests the presence of some systematic, but flawed, reasoning.

- Shows that "chain-of-thought" prompting approaches, where models repeat problems in their preferred R2L tokenization, can recover accuracy losses from using non-preferred L2R tokenization.

- Finds that while tokenization-dependent effects become weaker in larger GPT-4 models, they still persist, indicating the significance of these inductive biases.

Overall, the main contribution is clearly demonstrating and carefully analyzing the impact of number tokenization choices on arithmetic performance in state-of-the-art language models. The paper makes a case for model developers to closely consider tokenization schemes, especially for numerical reasoning tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that tokenization leads to inductive biases in large language models. How might one design a controlled experiment to definitively test whether tokenization causes inductive biases versus other potential confounds like model architecture or objective function?

2. The paper studies the effect of left-to-right versus right-to-left tokenization on arithmetic task performance. What other dimensions of tokenization could lead to inductive biases (e.g. vocabulary size, stemming strategies)? How might one systematically test the effect of these other factors?

3. The authors find that right-to-left tokenization leads to higher accuracy on arithmetic tasks. Why might this directionality be beneficial even when there are no mismatches in input versus output length? Are there tasks where left-to-right may show benefits? 

4. The paper proposes having models "repeat" inputs in the preferred tokenization scheme as a mitigation strategy. How else might models infer or be trained to convert between tokenization schemes automatically? What are the limitations of the repeating strategy?

5. The error analyses reveal interesting digit-specific mistakes that point to possible systematic reasoning in models. What other analyses could shed light on the underlying computations models are performing during arithmetic tasks under different tokenization schemes?

6. How exactly do the findings in this paper help elucidate the debate around whether large language models perform fuzzy pattern matching versus systematic reasoning for arithmetic? What further experiments could help clarify this?

7. The paper studies GPT models exclusively. How might the findings generalize or differ across other large language model architectures like Transformers or Deep Equilibrium Models?

8. The authors use a comma-based strategy to enforce right-to-left tokenization at inference time. What other strategies could one employ to control tokenization direction without access to the model's tokens?

9. How might the findings change if models were pre-trained from scratch with controlled tokenization schemes? What challenges would need to be overcome to scale such an experiment?

10. The paper hypothesizes inductive biases arise from compression rates and length generalization properties varying across tokenization schemes. How might one test these specific hypotheses directly?
