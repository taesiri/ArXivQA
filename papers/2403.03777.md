# [ENOT: Expectile Regularization for Fast and Accurate Training of Neural   Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Optimal transport (OT) is an important problem in machine learning but computing the optimal transport plan between two high-dimensional probability measures is very challenging. 
- Existing neural network-based methods for OT have two main limitations: 1) Finding the conjugate potential (c-transform) is computationally expensive as it requires an inner optimization loop, 2) The approximation of the c-transform is unstable during training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Expectile-Regularised Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT) which uses an expectile regression loss to regularize the training of the dual potentials.
- The key idea is that instead of explicitly computing the c-transform which is intractable, the expectile loss acts as an implicit regularizer that allows learning potentials that well-approximate the true c-transform.
- Specifically, the expectile loss enforces an upper bound on the distribution of possible conjugate potentials, making training more stable.
- ENOT alternates between updating the dual potentials and transport map, with the additional expectile regularization loss added when updating potentials.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a theoretically grounded expectile regularization for training dual potentials that makes it more stable and obviates the need for explicit c-transform computation.
- Achieves up to 10x speed up and 3x better performance compared to prior state-of-the-art on Wasserstein-2 benchmark, while also performing well on other synthetic datasets.
- Makes high-dimensional neural optimal transport more affordable and practical for downstream applications.
- Overall, provides an efficient way to train optimal transport that is faster, more accurate and more stable than existing approaches.
