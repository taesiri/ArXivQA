# [Knowledge Sharing in Manufacturing using Large Language Models: User   Evaluation and Model Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Managing knowledge efficiently is crucial in manufacturing factories, which have become increasingly knowledge-intensive. This puts strain on training and supporting new operators.  
- Large amounts of knowledge exist in factory documentation but have been challenging to leverage with AI until now.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a Large Language Model (LLM) based system to harness the extensive knowledge contained in factory documentation to efficiently answer operator queries and facilitate knowledge sharing.
- The system uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - relevant sections of manuals/reports are retrieved and supplied to the LLM along with the operator's question to provide context. 
- Several LLMs were benchmarked on answering questions based on the retrieved context documents.

Key Contributions:
- Conducted a user study at a factory to evaluate the system's usability and potential benefits/risks. Results showed it enables quicker information retrieval and issue resolution but human experts are still preferred.
- Benchmarked closed-sourced (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-sourced (StableBeluga2) LLMs on answering questions using RAG. GPT-4 performed best but StableBeluga2 was close behind and has customization benefits.  
- Provided preliminary insights for factories considering using RAG-LLM tools for knowledge management regarding perceived benefits, risks, model performance, and benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is using RAG with LLMs to leverage knowledge in factory documentation to assist operators. Evaluations showed positive utility but risks exist, and benchmarks demonstrated leading models. This offers initial guidance for factories adopting such AI tools.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces an LLM-based system to harness factory documentation for answering operator queries and facilitating knowledge sharing, evaluates it through a user study highlighting benefits but also concerns, and benchmarks several LLMs with GPT-4 leading in performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development and evaluation of an LLM-based system to support knowledge sharing and information retrieval for factory operators. Specifically:

1) The authors built a functional system that utilizes retrieval augmented generation with factory documentation to answer operator queries. The system allows operators to pose queries and see the relevant document sections used to generate the response.

2) Several LLMs were benchmarked on their ability to answer questions based on factory manuals and issue reports retrieved as context. The benchmarking showed GPT-4 performing best, but open-source models like StableBeluga2 were close behind.  

3) A user study was conducted with factory managers to gain preliminary insights into the perceived benefits, risks and challenges of using such a system. Key benefits identified include quicker information retrieval and issue resolution. However, there were concerns about safety risks and a preference for learning from human experts when available.

4) Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of LLMs to support knowledge sharing in manufacturing through retrieval augmented generation over factory documentation. The benchmarking provides guidance on model selection, while the user study highlights opportunities as well as areas needing consideration before deployment.
