# [Federated Learning via Plurality Vote](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design a communication-efficient federated learning algorithm that jointly optimizes communication overhead, learning reliability, and deployment efficiency? 

The key points are:

- Existing federated learning methods like FedAvg face challenges in communication efficiency, Byzantine resilience, and model deployment on edge devices. 

- The authors propose a new federated learning algorithm called FedVote, which has the following key features:

1) Clients train a quantized neural network model locally and send binary/ternary weights to the server. This reduces communication overhead.

2) The server aggregates models via weighted voting, which enhances resilience against Byzantine attacks. 

3) The quantized model can be efficiently deployed on edge devices. 

- Theoretically and empirically, the authors demonstrate that FedVote achieves better trade-offs between communication efficiency, Byzantine resilience, and deployment efficiency compared to existing algorithms.

- Specifically, FedVote requires much lower communication overhead than gradient quantization methods while achieving higher test accuracy. It also shows stronger Byzantine resilience than algorithms based on coordinate-wise median or similarity scores.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by combining model quantization, voting-based aggregation, and reputation management, the proposed FedVote algorithm can achieve good performance in communication efficiency, Byzantine resilience, and deployment efficiency simultaneously in federated learning. The theoretical analysis and experimental results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new federated learning algorithm called Federated Learning via Plurality Vote (FedVote). The key ideas are:

- Clients train quantized neural networks (QNNs) with binary/ternary weights locally and transmit the low-bit weights to the server. This reduces communication overhead.

- The server aggregates client models via weighted voting. This enhances resilience against Byzantine attacks.  

- The resulting global model with quantized weights is also efficient for deployment on edge devices.

2. It provides theoretical analysis showing that FedVote converges for nonconvex objectives, and outperforms methods like FedPAQ that directly quantize model updates.

3. It demonstrates through experiments that FedVote achieves higher test accuracy than existing methods like FedPAQ, SignSGD, and FedAvg under the same communication constraint. An extension called Byzantine-FedVote exhibits strong robustness against various Byzantine attacks.

In summary, FedVote jointly optimizes communication efficiency, learning reliability, and deployment efficiency in federated learning. The key novelty is the design of client-side model quantization and server-side voting aggregation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new federated learning method called Federated Learning via Plurality Vote (FedVote) that uses binary or ternary weights to reduce communication overhead, aggregates models via weighted voting to improve resilience against attacks, and results in lightweight models suitable for edge device deployment.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new federated learning algorithm called FedVote that uses quantized neural networks to reduce communication overhead between clients and the server. The key contributions compared to prior work are:

1. FedVote trains quantized neural networks (with binary/ternary weights) locally on each client to reduce the size of the model updates that need to be transmitted. This is different from other methods like FedPAQ and SignSGD that directly quantize raw gradients. The paper shows through analysis and experiments that quantizing weights is more effective than quantizing gradients.

2. The server aggregates the binary/ternary model weights from clients through a voting mechanism. This allows flexibility to incorporate different voting schemes, like the reputation-based voting presented, to improve robustness against Byzantine attacks. 

3. The empirical results demonstrate FedVote achieves higher test accuracy compared to gradient quantization methods like FedPAQ and SignSGD given the same communication budget. It also shows better Byzantine resilience than methods like coordinate-wise median and Krum.

4. After training, the resulting quantized model can be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained edge devices, saving memory and computation compared to a full-precision model.

Overall, FedVote demonstrates quantizing model weights combined with voting-based aggregation provides an effective approach to balance communication efficiency, Byzantine resilience, and deployment efficiency in federated learning. The analysis and experiments provide new insights on the advantage of model quantization over gradient quantization in this setting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend the analysis to general non-convex optimization problems beyond neural networks. The current analysis makes assumptions specific to neural network training like the Lipschitz smoothness of the loss function. More general convergence analysis would be useful.

- Investigate the impact of different normalization functions on the convergence rate. The authors suggest that the choice of normalization function influences the balance between reducing quantization error and maintaining training stability. More analysis or guidelines on choosing the function would be helpful.

- Consider partial client participation at each round. The current analysis assumes full client participation in every round. Extending it to the practical scenario of partial participation is an important direction. 

- Explore the convergence bounds in the non-i.i.d. data setting. The current analysis focuses on the i.i.d. case. Understanding convergence guarantees under heterogeneous data distribution is an open problem.

- Apply the voting mechanism to cross-silo federated learning with a large number of adversarial clients. The authors demonstrate enhanced resilience in small-scale experiments. Testing in large-scale cross-silo federated learning would be interesting.

- Investigate multi-task federated learning using the proposed framework. The authors focus on single-task learning. Extending it to multi-task learning could improve communication efficiency further.

- Explore hardware-efficient deployment of the trained quantized models on edge devices. The authors demonstrate the computational advantages of binary neural networks. Further optimization or specialized hardware design could be impactful.

In summary, the authors point out several promising directions to extend the theory, improve algorithm design, and enable applications of the proposed federated learning method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "Federated Learning via Plurality Vote":

This paper proposes a new federated learning algorithm called FedVote that aims to jointly optimize communication overhead, learning reliability, and deployment efficiency. In FedVote, clients train neural networks with quantized weights and transmit binary/ternary weight vectors to the server in each round. The server aggregates the models via weighted voting and broadcasts the soft voting results back to the clients.

The paper proposes a new federated learning algorithm called Federated Learning via Plurality Vote (FedVote). In FedVote, each client trains a binary/ternary neural network locally and sends the quantized weights to the server.
