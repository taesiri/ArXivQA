# [A 23 MW data centre is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17265)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can a rigorous application of the Central Limit Theorem be used to predict the future trajectory of technological progress, and specifically the date/time at which progress will peak?The authors apply the Central Limit Theorem to historical data on technological progress to predict that progress will peak on July 20, 2032 at 3:07am BST. They then explore the implications of this prediction, focusing on how a large enough computing system (~23MW data center) could be used at the peak moment to influence future spelling conventions and create linguistic "lock in."So in summary, the main hypothesis is that the Central Limit Theorem can be used to accurately predict the peaking of technological progress, and that control of sufficient computing power at the peak moment presents opportunities for long-term influence over things like dominant spelling conventions. The paper explores this hypothesis and its implications.
