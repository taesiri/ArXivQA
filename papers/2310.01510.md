# [Neutrinos from muon-rich ultra high energy electromagnetic cascades: The   MUNHECA code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01510)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main goals of this paper appear to be:1. To present a new public Python code called MUNHECA to compute the neutrino spectrum from muon-rich ultra high energy electromagnetic cascades. 2. To improve the modeling of several quantum electrodynamic (QED) processes relevant for these cascades, such as double pair production (DPP) and electron muon pair production (EMPP).3. To provide examples of using the MUNHECA code and compare it to previous more simplified estimates of the neutrino spectrum from cascades. The central hypothesis seems to be that properly accounting for processes like DPP and EMPP, in addition to the more commonly considered ones like muon pair production (MPP), will substantially change the predicted neutrino spectra from these electromagnetic cascades. The paper aims to quantify these effects with the improved modeling enabled by the MUNHECA code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- The authors introduce MUNHECA, a new public Python code to simulate high-energy electromagnetic cascades initiated by photons or electrons, and compute the resulting neutrino spectra. The code can model cascades propagating through the cosmological microwave background at high redshifts, or within astrophysical sources interacting with a thermal photon background.- The code incorporates several important QED processes beyond just pair production and inverse Compton scattering. In particular, it includes double pair production, muon pair production, charged pion pair production, electron muon pair production, and electron triplet production. The authors re-evaluate some of these processes, like double pair production, in more detail. - MUNHECA allows the user to easily adjust settings like the injected photon spectrum, background photon field, and which microphysics processes to include. It outputs neutrino spectra as well as information on the particles produced during the cascade evolution.- Compared to previous estimates, the more complete physics in MUNHECA can lead to substantially different neutrino flux predictions, especially at lower energies. This underscores the importance of modeling cascades accurately.- The authors provide some example applications of MUNHECA, re-computing neutrino yields from monochromatic ultra high energy photon propagation over cosmological distances, and for a model of the neutrino source NGC 1068.In summary, the paper introduces a new publicly available code for simulating electromagnetic cascades and computing neutrino yields, with a more complete treatment of microphysics than previous estimates. It highlights the potential impact this can have on predictions for neutrino fluxes.
