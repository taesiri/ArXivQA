# [Neutrinos from muon-rich ultra high energy electromagnetic cascades: The   MUNHECA code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01510)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main goals of this paper appear to be:

1. To present a new public Python code called MUNHECA to compute the neutrino spectrum from muon-rich ultra high energy electromagnetic cascades. 

2. To improve the modeling of several quantum electrodynamic (QED) processes relevant for these cascades, such as double pair production (DPP) and electron muon pair production (EMPP).

3. To provide examples of using the MUNHECA code and compare it to previous more simplified estimates of the neutrino spectrum from cascades. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that properly accounting for processes like DPP and EMPP, in addition to the more commonly considered ones like muon pair production (MPP), will substantially change the predicted neutrino spectra from these electromagnetic cascades. The paper aims to quantify these effects with the improved modeling enabled by the MUNHECA code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- The authors introduce MUNHECA, a new public Python code to simulate high-energy electromagnetic cascades initiated by photons or electrons, and compute the resulting neutrino spectra. The code can model cascades propagating through the cosmological microwave background at high redshifts, or within astrophysical sources interacting with a thermal photon background.

- The code incorporates several important QED processes beyond just pair production and inverse Compton scattering. In particular, it includes double pair production, muon pair production, charged pion pair production, electron muon pair production, and electron triplet production. The authors re-evaluate some of these processes, like double pair production, in more detail. 

- MUNHECA allows the user to easily adjust settings like the injected photon spectrum, background photon field, and which microphysics processes to include. It outputs neutrino spectra as well as information on the particles produced during the cascade evolution.

- Compared to previous estimates, the more complete physics in MUNHECA can lead to substantially different neutrino flux predictions, especially at lower energies. This underscores the importance of modeling cascades accurately.

- The authors provide some example applications of MUNHECA, re-computing neutrino yields from monochromatic ultra high energy photon propagation over cosmological distances, and for a model of the neutrino source NGC 1068.

In summary, the paper introduces a new publicly available code for simulating electromagnetic cascades and computing neutrino yields, with a more complete treatment of microphysics than previous estimates. It highlights the potential impact this can have on predictions for neutrino fluxes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new publicly available code called MUNHECA for modeling the production of high-energy neutrinos from electromagnetic cascades initiated by ultra-high energy photons or electrons. Here are some key ways this work compares to prior research on this topic:

- It incorporates a more complete treatment of the relevant quantum electrodynamics (QED) processes that govern the cascade development compared to previous estimates. This includes re-evaluating inelasticities and cross sections for important processes like double pair production (DPP) and electron muon-pair production (EMPP). 

- The code allows the cascade to be modeled in two contexts: propagating through the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at high redshifts, or interacting with a customizable photon background near an astrophysical source. Previous studies have focused more narrowly on cascades in the CMB.

- By implementing a Monte Carlo approach, MUNHECA aims to fully capture the stochastic nature of the cascade processes. Earlier analytic estimates made various simplifying assumptions about the neutrino yields.

- The code structure and interface seem designed to provide flexibility to users in specifying parameters like the injected photon spectrum, choice of interactions, and output formats. This extends the utility beyond the specific examples presented.

- The provided examples show MUNHECA yields significantly different neutrino spectrum predictions compared to some past approximations, especially at lower energies. This highlights the value of the improved physics modeling.

- The code is publicly available so that other researchers can apply it to scenarios of interest. Wider adoption would standardize predictions in this developing research area.

In summary, MUNHECA appears to be an important step forward in modeling high-energy neutrinos from electromagnetic cascades by incorporating more complete physics, handling stochastic processes, and providing a flexible tool to researchers. The results illustrate the impact of improved modeling relative to past approximations. This represents progress towards robust predictions to compare against neutrino telescope observations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the modeling of several processes in the electromagnetic cascade, such as the impact of magnetic fields, a better treatment of pion production going beyond the Born approximation, and inclusion of hadronic resonances. 

- Studying sources where the high-energy photons are produced by mechanisms other than synchrotron radiation, to avoid the complications of modeling the cascade development with strong magnetic fields.

- Exploring different injection spectra beyond the monochromatic and power-law cases presented. The flexible structure of the code allows for studying arbitrary injection spectra.

- Applying the code to additional astrophysical sources beyond the NGC 1068 example presented, to predict neutrino fluxes for comparison with current and future neutrino telescopes. 

- Comparing the predictions of the leptonic electromagnetic cascade model to observations, to test if this channel could provide an explanation for detected neutrino fluxes.

- Improving the statistics by running more Monte Carlo realizations, to reduce uncertainties, especially at lower energies where fluxes are small.

- Exploring different target photon fields and source redshifts to map out the parameter space.

- Adding new processes to the code as they become relevant at even higher energies, such as electroweak processes.

- Generalizing the calculations beyond the leading-order results currently implemented.

In summary, the authors suggest a range of possible improvements to themodeling and greater exploration of the astrophysical parameter space to further develop predictions from this leptonic neutrino production mechanism. Comparisons to data and competing models are needed to evaluate its viability.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents the public python code MUNHECA (Muons and Neutrinos in High-Energy Electromagnetic Cascades) to compute the neutrino spectrum produced in ultra high energy electromagnetic cascades. The code tracks the particles produced in the cascade by including various QED processes like electron-positron pair production (EPP), muon pair production (MPP), double pair production (DPP), charged pion pair production (CPPP), inverse Compton scattering (ICS), electron muon-pair production (EMPP) and electron triplet production (ETP). It can simulate the cascade development either along cosmological photon backgrounds or inside astrophysical sources with arbitrary target spectra. The code uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the stochastic cascade and produces muon, pion, electron and photon spectra. These are then used to compute the emerging neutrino spectrum at the observer. The paper provides details on the implementation of the code, the processes included, and shows example applications. It demonstrates that a full Monte Carlo treatment is necessary to accurately capture the neutrino production, improving upon earlier analytic estimates. The public code will enable more detailed studies of neutrino production in electromagnetic cascades in various astrophysical contexts.
