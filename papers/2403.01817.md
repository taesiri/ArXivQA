# [NusaBERT: Teaching IndoBERT to be Multilingual and Multicultural](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indonesia has over 700 languages and dialects, presenting challenges for modern language models which struggle with code-switching and low-resource regional languages
- Existing models like IndoBERT perform well on Indonesian but have limitations in handling intricacies of code-switching and needs of regional languages
- Models need to be tailored to address Indonesia's complex multilingual and multicultural linguistic landscape

Proposed Solution - NusaBERT:
- Builds on IndoBERT by incorporating vocabulary expansion and continued pretraining on a diverse multilingual corpus
- Corpus includes 13 languages - Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, etc. and uses high quality datasets like CulturaX, Wikipedia, KoPI-NLLB
- Added 1511 new tokens to vocabulary using a new WordPiece tokenizer to introduce regional language tokens 
- Continued pretraining for 500K steps on 16B tokens using RoBERTa-style masked language modeling objective

Key Contributions:
- State-of-the-art performance on variety of Indonesian and multilingual benchmark datasets - IndoNLU, NusaX, NusaWrites
- Competitive results on Indonesian NLU, improved on sequence labeling tasks like NER and POS tagging
- Significant gains on regional languages over IndoBERT, especially those included in pretraining corpus
- Still struggles with extremely low resource and distinct languages indicating further research needed
- Overall, effectively enhances IndoBERT's multilinguality and ability to address linguistic diversity of Indonesia

The paper proposes an important advancement in developing language models tailored to the complex linguistic landscape of Indonesia. By expanding vocabulary and exposure to regional languages, NusaBERT pushes boundaries of monolingual models while retaining capabilities. Further work on distinguishing language tokens and model stability could help address limitations.
