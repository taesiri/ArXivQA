# [NusaBERT: Teaching IndoBERT to be Multilingual and Multicultural](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indonesia has over 700 languages and dialects, presenting challenges for modern language models which struggle with code-switching and low-resource regional languages
- Existing models like IndoBERT perform well on Indonesian but have limitations in handling intricacies of code-switching and needs of regional languages
- Models need to be tailored to address Indonesia's complex multilingual and multicultural linguistic landscape

Proposed Solution - NusaBERT:
- Builds on IndoBERT by incorporating vocabulary expansion and continued pretraining on a diverse multilingual corpus
- Corpus includes 13 languages - Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, etc. and uses high quality datasets like CulturaX, Wikipedia, KoPI-NLLB
- Added 1511 new tokens to vocabulary using a new WordPiece tokenizer to introduce regional language tokens 
- Continued pretraining for 500K steps on 16B tokens using RoBERTa-style masked language modeling objective

Key Contributions:
- State-of-the-art performance on variety of Indonesian and multilingual benchmark datasets - IndoNLU, NusaX, NusaWrites
- Competitive results on Indonesian NLU, improved on sequence labeling tasks like NER and POS tagging
- Significant gains on regional languages over IndoBERT, especially those included in pretraining corpus
- Still struggles with extremely low resource and distinct languages indicating further research needed
- Overall, effectively enhances IndoBERT's multilinguality and ability to address linguistic diversity of Indonesia

The paper proposes an important advancement in developing language models tailored to the complex linguistic landscape of Indonesia. By expanding vocabulary and exposure to regional languages, NusaBERT pushes boundaries of monolingual models while retaining capabilities. Further work on distinguishing language tokens and model stability could help address limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

NusaBERT is a multilingual language model for Indonesian and its regional languages, built on IndoBERT, that applies vocabulary expansion and continued pre-training on a cleaned multilingual corpus to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Indonesian and multilingual natural language understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing NusaBERT, a multilingual language model tailored for the linguistic diversity of Indonesia. Specifically, the key aspects of NusaBERT's contribution are:

1) It builds on top of IndoBERT by applying vocabulary expansion and continued pre-training on a multilingual corpus covering 12 regional languages of Indonesia. This enhances IndoBERT's capabilities in handling the complex linguistic landscape of Indonesia. 

2) Through evaluations on benchmarks like IndoNLU, NusaX, and NusaWrites, NusaBERT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Indonesian and multilingual natural language understanding tasks. This shows its effectiveness in addressing the needs of low-resource regional languages.

3) By tackling the unique challenges posed by Indonesia's exceptional linguistic diversity, NusaBERT paves the way for future NLP research on under-represented languages in this linguistically rich region. Its techniques could potentially be applied to support other low-resource languages as well.

In summary, NusaBERT's main contribution is producing a multilingual language model tailored specifically for Indonesia by building on IndoBERT, incorporating regional languages, and showing strong performance on Indonesian and multilingual benchmarks. This advances the capabilities for processing Indonesia's complex linguistic landscape.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- NusaBERT - The proposed multilingual language model tailored for Indonesian and its regional languages. Builds on top of IndoBERT.

- Vocabulary expansion - A technique used to expand NusaBERT's vocabulary to include regional language tokens, similar to PhayaThaiBERT. Helps the model understand loanwords.  

- Continued pre-training - Further pre-training of NusaBERT on a new multilingual corpus containing texts in Indonesian and 12 regional languages. Enhances its capabilities.

- Multilinguality - A key focus of NusaBERT is improving performance on multiple languages used in Indonesia beyond just Indonesian.

- Low-resource languages - Many regional languages have limited textual resources. NusaBERT aims to address challenges with these.  

- Code-switching - The common phenomenon of mixing multiple languages. Still a major challenge for NusaBERT.

- Benchmark datasets - NusaBERT was evaluated on tasks from IndoNLU, NusaX, and NusaWrites to measure language understanding across multiple benchmarks.

- Fine-tuning - Adaptation technique used to specialize NusaBERT models to downstream tasks while retaining general knowledge from pre-training.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the specific techniques used for vocabulary expansion in NusaBERT, and how did they differ from the approach taken in PhayaThaiBERT? What was the rationale behind NusaBERT's approach?

2. What were the key considerations and tradeoffs in determining the target vocabulary size for NusaBERT? How was the final size of 32,032 tokens arrived at? 

3. The paper mentions simpler continued pre-training procedures compared to PhayaThaiBERT. Can you elaborate on the differences? Why was a simpler approach preferred for NusaBERT?

4. What were some of the major differences between the pre-training corpus used for NusaBERT versus PhayaThaiBERT? What specific considerations went into curating the corpus for NusaBERT?

5. The benchmark results show drops in performance on some Indonesian NLU tasks compared to IndoBERT. What could be some potential reasons for this? How can this issue be addressed in future work?

6. While NusaBERT shows strong improvements on regional languages present in the pretraining corpus, performance gains are inconsistent across all languages. What factors could explain this inconsistency?  

7. For languages not present in the pretraining corpus, NusaBERT demonstrates cross-lingual transferability. What evidence from the results supports this? What mechanisms enable this transferability?

8. NusaBERT struggles with the NusaParagraph tasks more than NusaX/NusaTranslation. Why is this? How do the nature/content of these datasets differ? How can this issue be resolved?

9. The results show that NusaBERT exhibits code-mixing robustness that varies across tasks. What explanations are provided for this in the paper? How can robustness be improved? 

10. The paper discusses limitations of vocabulary expansion for extremely low-resource languages. What alternative techniques are suggested to address this issue? What other limitations need to be resolved?
