# [Magic-Me: Identity-Specific Video Customized Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating videos that preserve a specific identity (e.g. of a person or animal) is challenging for current text-to-video (T2V) models. 
- Simply fine-tuning a pre-trained T2V model on a few images of an identity, as done for text-to-image models, results in inconsistent identity and backgrounds across video frames.

Proposed Solution - Video Custom Diffusion (VCD):
- Uses an ID module to extract compact identity embeddings from reference images, trained with masked loss and prompt-to-segmentation to remove background noise.  
- Employs training-free 3D Gaussian noise prior to induce covariance between input frames for better consistency.
- Has T2V VCD module to generate videos conditioned on identity embeddings and text prompts.
- Additionally uses Face VCD and Tiled VCD (video-to-video) to enhance face details and increase video resolution.

Main Contributions:
- ID module for precise identity disentanglement using extended identity tokens and masked loss.
- 3D Gaussian noise prior that induces covariance between input frames for better video consistency.
- Overall VCD framework for identity-preserving video generation with T2V and V2V pipelines.
- Demonstrates VCD's ability to generate high-quality, identity-consistent videos that align better with reference images and text prompts compared to baselines.
- Shows VCD works for both text-to-video and video-to-video scenarios as well as with different base models.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of identity preservation for text-to-video generation, and proposes the VCD solution with novel components for identity learning and video consistency, outperforming previous approaches.
