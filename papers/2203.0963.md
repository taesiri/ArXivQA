# [Follow-Up of Extended Shells around B[e] Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.0963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals are:1. To perform follow-up observations of B[e] stars that were previously found to have extended nebulae, in order to detect any changes or evolution in the nebulae over time. 2. To extend the survey for extended nebulae to additional southern targets and fainter northern ones, in order to enlarge the sample of B[e] stars with known large-scale ejecta.3. To utilize imaging, long-slit spectroscopy, and 3D spectroscopy to study the detailed structure and physical properties of the nebulae, such as morphology, kinematics, density, ionization, and chemistry.4. To gain new insights into the mass-loss history and evolutionary state of B[e] stars based on the observations of their extended nebulae. In particular, the authors aim to address the questions of what mechanisms cause the mass ejections that create the observed nebulae around B[e] stars and how these ejecta relate to the evolutionary state of the central B[e] stars. This appears to be the main open question that the observational program outlined in this paper seeks to shed light on.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It presents follow-up observations and analysis of extended shells/nebulae around B[e] stars, massive stars that show emission lines and infrared excess from circumstellar dust. - The authors have conducted an H-alpha imaging survey of 32 B[e] stars, including re-observations of 25 stars previously imaged about 2 decades ago. They detect nebular features around 15 new stars, bringing the total number of B[e] stars with detected large-scale nebulae to 27.- The paper includes new, deeper H-alpha images and spectroscopic observations (long-slit, scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry) for 3 B[e] stars: the supergiants MWC 137 and MWC 314, and the unclassified B[e] star MWC 819. - For MWC 137, they find an elliptical ionized nebula but no clear changes over 18 years. Velocity and density maps show complex kinematics. - For MWC 314, they propose a new third nebula lobe based on imaging, though this needs further velocity confirmation. No expansion is detected over 18 years.- For MWC 819, new images reveal additional faint nebula features not seen before, including a possible jet.- Overall, the survey doubles the number of B[e] stars with detected large-scale ejecta. New images and spectra provide clues about the mass-loss history and formation mechanisms for the extended shells. This sheds light on the role of these enigmatic objects in galactic evolution.In summary, the key contribution is presenting an enlarged sample of B[e] star nebulae and new observations constraining their morphology and evolution over timescales of ~20 years. This expands our understanding of the circumstellar environments and mass loss from these important massive stars.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents follow-up observations and analysis of extended gas shells around a sample of B[e] stars, massive emission line stars that eject large amounts of mass and are important for galactic chemical enrichment, finding nebulae around 15 more stars and investigating the detailed structure and kinematics for a few objects to learn about their mass loss history.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of circumstellar environments around B[e] stars:- This paper focuses on follow-up observations and analysis of extended ionized nebulae around a sample of Galactic B[e] stars. Most previous studies have concentrated on the small-scale dusty disks around these objects revealed through infrared observations and interferometry. So this complements existing research by probing the large-scale circumstellar environment.- The study aims to enlarge the sample of B[e] stars with confirmed extended nebulae. The only previous survey was by Marston & McCollum 2008 which detected nebulae around 12 out of 25 northern B[e] stars. By observing 32 additional stars, both northern and southern, this paper significantly increases the number of B[e] stars with detected nebulae.- The multi-wavelength approach combining imaging and spectroscopy is fairly comprehensive compared to previous work. In addition to Halpha imaging to detect nebulae, the authors utilize long-slit spectra, scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry, and infrared observations to study the physical properties and kinematics of the gas and dust.- Most studies of circumstellar nebulae around evolved massive stars like LBVs have focused on morphology and expansion velocities. The kinematic analysis in this paper seems more detailed, mapping the complex velocity patterns across the nebulae.- The sample of B[e] stars spans a range of evolutionary phases, which allows probing potential relationships between stellar evolution and nebula properties. Many individual objects have been analyzed before, but this systematic survey enables comparative studies.In summary, this paper extends previous work on B[e] star environments by enlarging the sample size, probing larger spatial scales, and obtaining more detailed kinematic information. The combination of data sources provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the circumstellar gas and dust on both small and large scales for these rare and intriguing objects.
