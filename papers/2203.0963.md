# [Follow-Up of Extended Shells around B[e] Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.0963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals are:

1. To perform follow-up observations of B[e] stars that were previously found to have extended nebulae, in order to detect any changes or evolution in the nebulae over time. 

2. To extend the survey for extended nebulae to additional southern targets and fainter northern ones, in order to enlarge the sample of B[e] stars with known large-scale ejecta.

3. To utilize imaging, long-slit spectroscopy, and 3D spectroscopy to study the detailed structure and physical properties of the nebulae, such as morphology, kinematics, density, ionization, and chemistry.

4. To gain new insights into the mass-loss history and evolutionary state of B[e] stars based on the observations of their extended nebulae. 

In particular, the authors aim to address the questions of what mechanisms cause the mass ejections that create the observed nebulae around B[e] stars and how these ejecta relate to the evolutionary state of the central B[e] stars. This appears to be the main open question that the observational program outlined in this paper seeks to shed light on.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- It presents follow-up observations and analysis of extended shells/nebulae around B[e] stars, massive stars that show emission lines and infrared excess from circumstellar dust. 

- The authors have conducted an H-alpha imaging survey of 32 B[e] stars, including re-observations of 25 stars previously imaged about 2 decades ago. They detect nebular features around 15 new stars, bringing the total number of B[e] stars with detected large-scale nebulae to 27.

- The paper includes new, deeper H-alpha images and spectroscopic observations (long-slit, scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry) for 3 B[e] stars: the supergiants MWC 137 and MWC 314, and the unclassified B[e] star MWC 819. 

- For MWC 137, they find an elliptical ionized nebula but no clear changes over 18 years. Velocity and density maps show complex kinematics. 

- For MWC 314, they propose a new third nebula lobe based on imaging, though this needs further velocity confirmation. No expansion is detected over 18 years.

- For MWC 819, new images reveal additional faint nebula features not seen before, including a possible jet.

- Overall, the survey doubles the number of B[e] stars with detected large-scale ejecta. New images and spectra provide clues about the mass-loss history and formation mechanisms for the extended shells. This sheds light on the role of these enigmatic objects in galactic evolution.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an enlarged sample of B[e] star nebulae and new observations constraining their morphology and evolution over timescales of ~20 years. This expands our understanding of the circumstellar environments and mass loss from these important massive stars.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents follow-up observations and analysis of extended gas shells around a sample of B[e] stars, massive emission line stars that eject large amounts of mass and are important for galactic chemical enrichment, finding nebulae around 15 more stars and investigating the detailed structure and kinematics for a few objects to learn about their mass loss history.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of circumstellar environments around B[e] stars:

- This paper focuses on follow-up observations and analysis of extended ionized nebulae around a sample of Galactic B[e] stars. Most previous studies have concentrated on the small-scale dusty disks around these objects revealed through infrared observations and interferometry. So this complements existing research by probing the large-scale circumstellar environment.

- The study aims to enlarge the sample of B[e] stars with confirmed extended nebulae. The only previous survey was by Marston & McCollum 2008 which detected nebulae around 12 out of 25 northern B[e] stars. By observing 32 additional stars, both northern and southern, this paper significantly increases the number of B[e] stars with detected nebulae.

- The multi-wavelength approach combining imaging and spectroscopy is fairly comprehensive compared to previous work. In addition to Halpha imaging to detect nebulae, the authors utilize long-slit spectra, scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry, and infrared observations to study the physical properties and kinematics of the gas and dust.

- Most studies of circumstellar nebulae around evolved massive stars like LBVs have focused on morphology and expansion velocities. The kinematic analysis in this paper seems more detailed, mapping the complex velocity patterns across the nebulae.

- The sample of B[e] stars spans a range of evolutionary phases, which allows probing potential relationships between stellar evolution and nebula properties. Many individual objects have been analyzed before, but this systematic survey enables comparative studies.

In summary, this paper extends previous work on B[e] star environments by enlarging the sample size, probing larger spatial scales, and obtaining more detailed kinematic information. The combination of data sources provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the circumstellar gas and dust on both small and large scales for these rare and intriguing objects.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further observations to detect possible morphological changes or expansion of the nebulae in the plane of the sky over longer time baselines. The current observations did not reveal any changes over 18 years, but the authors suggest more observations over longer time periods may be able to detect changes.

- Additional spectroscopic observations (long-slit spectra, 3D spectra) to further analyze the physical properties and kinematics of the nebulae. The authors have some initial observations but suggest more are needed for a complete understanding.

- Extending the survey to more objects, including fainter targets and more in the southern sky, to enlarge the sample size of B[e] stars with confirmed nebulae. The authors aim to build a statistically meaningful sample.

- Analyzing the combined observational data to address the still unknown mass-loss history and evolutionary state of many B[e] stars. The detailed nebula information can provide clues about the evolution.

- Further observations to confirm whether newly detected faint nebular features are actually related to the central B[e] stars. Some newly detected structures still require more data to determine if they originate from the star.

- Using the knowledge gained about large-scale nebulae to better understand the small-scale circumstellar disks and mass loss events in B[e] stars. Connecting these structures may help elucidate the mass loss mechanisms.

In summary, the authors propose more observational data over longer times, analysis of physical properties, enlarging the sample size, and using the nebula details to elucidate the still mysterious mass loss history and evolutionary states of B[e] stars.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents preliminary results from an observational follow-up study of extended shells around B[e] stars. B[e] stars are massive emission line stars that are ejecting large amounts of mass and energy into their surroundings. A previous survey in 2001 detected extended shells around 12 out of 25 B[e] stars, indicating the presence of episodic mass ejection events. The authors have started a new survey to image the shells again after ~20 years to look for changes and expansion. They are also expanding the survey to fainter northern targets and southern targets. So far, they have discovered extended nebula structures around 15 additional B[e] stars. The paper focuses on results for three B[e] stars: the supergiants MWC 137 and MWC 314, and the unclassified B[e] star MWC 819. Comparison of images shows no detectable changes in nebula morphology or expansion over 18-20 years for MWC 137 and MWC 314. However, the deep image of MWC 314 reveals a possible third lobe that better fits the star's motion. Spectroscopy shows complex velocity patterns in the nebulae. The new MWC 819 image calls into question the previous identification of its nebula as a unipolar lobe, instead revealing likely detached nebulosity plus newly detected features suggestive of a jet. Further observations are needed to confirm the nature and relationship of the nebular structures around these B[e] stars.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents follow-up observations of extended nebulae surrounding B[e] stars, a class of hot massive stars that exhibit intense emission lines and infrared excess. Previous H-alpha imaging surveys found shells, rings, spirals and bipolar lobes surrounding about 50% of observed B[e] stars, indicating aspherical mass loss. The authors performed new H-alpha imaging with long baselines of up to 18 years to search for evolution of these nebulae. They also extended their survey to fainter northern B[e] stars and new southern targets. In total they detected extended nebulae around 15 more B[e] stars, bringing the number with known nebulae to 27. The nebulae display diverse morphologies, suggesting multiple formation mechanisms related to the stars' mass loss and ejection events.

The paper focuses on results for three B[e] stars: the supergiants MWC 137 and MWC 314, and the unclassified star MWC 819. New images reveal details of the nebulae's structures, but no clear morphological changes over 18 years. Radial velocity patterns across the nebulae are complex. The MWC 314 nebula may contain a newly identified third lobe that fits its proper motion direction. A deeper image of MWC 819 suggests its "unipolar lobe" is not actually connected, but rather a background nebula. Further observations are needed to fully understand the nebulae's structures and kinematics and constrain the evolutionary status of these enigmatic B[e] stars. Overall, this survey significantly increases the number of B[e] stars with detected large-scale ejecta.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a follow-up Hα imaging survey of the environments around B[e] stars, which are massive B-type emission-line stars surrounded by circumstellar gas and dust. The study utilizes new deep imaging with narrowband Hα filters to detect extended optical nebulae around these stars. The imaging is done with telescopes like the Nordic Optical Telescope, the Danish Telescope, and Gemini-South. The survey aims to detect evolution in nebula morphology and expansion compared to an earlier 2001 Hα survey, as well as extend the sample to southern targets and fainter northern ones. Long-slit and 3D spectral observations across nebulae are also obtained to derive physical properties like temperature and density. The goal is to study the large-scale ejected matter around B[e] stars which is not well understood, in order to learn about their mass-loss history. Preliminary results are presented for three B[e] stars: MWC 137, MWC 314, and MWC 819. Images are compared to older data to look for morphological changes in the nebulae, and spectral data is used to measure properties like radial velocity and electron density distributions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears to be addressing the problem that large-scale environments of B[e] stars have not been studied much. The key questions seem to be:

- How have the nebulae (extended shells) around known B[e] stars evolved over the past couple decades? 

- Can the sample of B[e] stars with detected nebulae be expanded, especially to include fainter and southern targets?

- What can be learned about the mass-loss history and evolutionary state of B[e] stars by studying their extended nebulae through imaging and spectroscopy?

The authors aim to follow-up known B[e] stars with nebulae to look for changes over time, as well as survey new B[e] star targets to detect more extended nebulae. By observing the nebulae in various wavelengths, they hope to better understand the mass ejection mechanisms and evolution of these stars.

In summary, the main problem is that not much is known about the large-scale environments of B[e] stars, and the key questions revolve around expanding the sample of detected nebulae and using multi-wavelength observations to uncover the mass-loss history and evolution of these enigmatic objects. The authors are utilizing imaging and spectroscopy to address these gaps.
