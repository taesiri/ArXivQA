# [Follow-Up of Extended Shells around B[e] Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.0963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals are:1. To perform follow-up observations of B[e] stars that were previously found to have extended nebulae, in order to detect any changes or evolution in the nebulae over time. 2. To extend the survey for extended nebulae to additional southern targets and fainter northern ones, in order to enlarge the sample of B[e] stars with known large-scale ejecta.3. To utilize imaging, long-slit spectroscopy, and 3D spectroscopy to study the detailed structure and physical properties of the nebulae, such as morphology, kinematics, density, ionization, and chemistry.4. To gain new insights into the mass-loss history and evolutionary state of B[e] stars based on the observations of their extended nebulae. In particular, the authors aim to address the questions of what mechanisms cause the mass ejections that create the observed nebulae around B[e] stars and how these ejecta relate to the evolutionary state of the central B[e] stars. This appears to be the main open question that the observational program outlined in this paper seeks to shed light on.
