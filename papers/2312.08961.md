# [Contact-Implicit MPC: Controlling Diverse Quadruped Motions Without   Pre-Planned Contact Modes or Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08961)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) framework that can simultaneously generate and execute diverse multi-contact motions for quadruped robots, without needing pre-defined contact sequences or trajectories. It uses a differential dynamic programming approach integrated with a hard contact model and analytical gradient computation of contact forces. To facilitate exploration of motions involving breaking contacts, the authors propose a novel smoothed gradient based on relaxed complementarity constraints. Additional cost terms are incorporated to ensure reliable foot clearance and prevent slippage. To address sensitivity to inaccurate state estimates in real-world use, a multiple shooting variant of the algorithm is leveraged to enhance robustness. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through dynamic 3D quadruped simulations and hardware experiments involving a trot gait and front-leg rearing on a 45kg robot. Key advantages are real-time performance, adaptive responses to disturbances, and the capacity to produce agile maneuvers without task-specific tuning. Limitations center around state estimation accuracy, and future work may integrate learning-based approaches to improve robustness. Overall, this contact-implicit MPC approach shows promise for enhancing autonomy in legged robots.
