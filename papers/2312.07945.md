## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new channel quality prediction method called Exponential Moving Average Linear Combination (ELC) for wireless networks. ELC is based on linearly combining multiple Exponential Moving Average (EMA) filters with different parameters to improve prediction accuracy over using just a single optimized EMA. The EMA filters and their linear combination weights are selected by minimizing the mean squared error on a training dataset. ELC was evaluated on frame delivery ratio data collected from a real Wi-Fi testbed over multiple channels and time periods. Results showed ELC reduced the mean squared error by 11-19% compared to optimized EMA. It also reduced the absolute prediction error by 7-12% on most channels. Despite combining multiple EMA filters, ELC has low computational complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices like wireless sensors. The paper demonstrates ELC's improved accuracy over EMA, while maintaining suitability for real-world embedded wireless implementations. Future work includes testing on more datasets, using neural networks to select EMA models per-frame, and investigating non-linear EMA combinations.
