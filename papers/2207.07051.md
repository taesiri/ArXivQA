# Language models show human-like content effects on reasoning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Do large language models show human-like content effects on reasoning tasks? The authors hypothesize that because large language models are trained on human-generated text, they will pick up on regularities and biases in how humans reason about different types of content. Therefore, the authors predict that language models will show similar biases to humans in how they perform on reasoning tasks depending on the content of the task - performing better on reasoning tasks with familiar, believable content compared to abstract or nonsensical content.To test this hypothesis, the authors evaluate large language models on three reasoning tasks that have been well-studied in cognitive science - natural language inference, assessing the validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. In all three tasks, they systematically vary the content of the reasoning problems to be believable/realistic, unbelievable, or abstract/nonsensical. They find that the language models mirror patterns of human reasoning biases, performing better on problems with believable content compared to unbelievable or abstract content across all three reasoning tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that language models will show human-like biases in reasoning that depend on the content of the task, and the experiments confirm this hypothesis across several different reasoning paradigms. Evaluating the models in this way provides insight into the factors that affect their reasoning abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main contribution is showing that large language models reflect many of the same patterns of content effects on reasoning that are observed in humans. Specifically, the paper finds that the performance of large language models on logical reasoning tasks depends on the content and context of the reasoning problems in ways that parallel known biases and limitations of human reasoning. For example, the models reason more accurately about logical rules grounded in realistic situations compared to arbitrary abstract rules, mirroring findings from classic experiments like the Wason selection task. The authors argue these findings have implications for both cognitive science and AI safety research in terms of understanding the factors that affect reasoning in intelligent systems. Overall, the key contribution appears to be using language models as a tool to gain insight into human cognitive biases and their computational basis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in abstract reasoning and content effects:- The use of large language models to investigate human reasoning biases is a relatively new approach. Most prior work has studied these effects in humans directly through behavioral experiments. Using language models allows testing hypotheses and generating new predictions at scale. - The paper comprehensively evaluates three different reasoning paradigms that have been extensively studied in cognitive science - natural language inference, syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. Connecting findings across these diverse tasks strengthens the case that language models mirror systematic human reasoning patterns.- The results support the view that both humans and large language models exhibit context-dependent, content-sensitive reasoning. This contrasts with some assumptions that neural networks behave in a purely heuristic or statistical manner. The paper argues that a unitary model can capture varied human-like behaviors through interaction of knowledge and context.- The paper integrates these findings with other recent work probing systematicity and abstract reasoning abilities of large language models. It emphasizes the limitations and biases in language model reasoning, while also highlighting how targeted training may improve model reasoning.- The cognitive modeling approach complements other lines of research using language models to reconstruct patterns of human neural activity during language processing. Linking behavioral and neural levels of analysis is an exciting direction for future work.In summary, this paper makes connections between several literatures on human reasoning, cognitive biases, and language model capabilities. The empirical findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human-like reasoning in large models. The work highlights opportunities to further develop and improve reasoning abilities in language models through targeted training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Further investigating the similarities between the internal computations of large language models like transformers and human neural/cognitive processing during reasoning tasks. The authors suggest this could lead to new hypotheses about the computational basis of human reasoning.- Causally manipulating features of the training process for language models to understand how different types of experience may lead to the emergence of human-like content biases in reasoning. This could offer insight into the origins of these biases in humans.- Exploring whether strategies that improve human logical reasoning and make it less dependent on content, like formal education, could also work to improve language models. For example, training language models to follow instructions better, verify and correct their own outputs, etc.- Using language models as a "baseline" to generate new hypotheses about human reasoning biases, since they seem to mirror a range of biases. Then testing whether humans actually show those same biases.- Further probing the limitations of language models as models of human reasoning, by testing them in more interactive, grounded, social situations and comparing to human performance.- Investigating whether language models can learn to adapt their reasoning in a context-sensitive way, trading off between heuristics and more abstract logic as humans are thought to do.So in summary, the authors lay out a research agenda focused on better understanding the connections between language models and human reasoning at multiple levels, from neural representations to overall behavioral patterns, and using insights from one to inform research on the other.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores whether large language models show similar content effects to humans when performing logical reasoning tasks. The authors evaluate language models on three reasoning tasks: natural language inference, assessing the validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. Across these tasks, they find that the language models reflect many of the same biases observed in human reasoning. For example, the models are more likely to accept invalid logical arguments as valid if the conclusion is consistent with common sense knowledge, similar to human "belief bias". The models also struggle with abstract versions of the Wason selection task, but perform better when it is framed realistically, paralleling findings in humans. Overall, the results suggest that the knowledge and biases learned by language models through pretraining lead them to mimic human errors and content effects during logical reasoning, rather than behaving as pure symbolic reasoners. The authors argue this highlights the difficulty of context-independent reasoning, and propose directions for future work on improving reasoning in language models.
