# [Language models show human-like content effects on reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Do large language models show human-like content effects on reasoning tasks? 

The authors hypothesize that because large language models are trained on human-generated text, they will pick up on regularities and biases in how humans reason about different types of content. Therefore, the authors predict that language models will show similar biases to humans in how they perform on reasoning tasks depending on the content of the task - performing better on reasoning tasks with familiar, believable content compared to abstract or nonsensical content.

To test this hypothesis, the authors evaluate large language models on three reasoning tasks that have been well-studied in cognitive science - natural language inference, assessing the validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. In all three tasks, they systematically vary the content of the reasoning problems to be believable/realistic, unbelievable, or abstract/nonsensical. They find that the language models mirror patterns of human reasoning biases, performing better on problems with believable content compared to unbelievable or abstract content across all three reasoning tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that language models will show human-like biases in reasoning that depend on the content of the task, and the experiments confirm this hypothesis across several different reasoning paradigms. Evaluating the models in this way provides insight into the factors that affect their reasoning abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main contribution is showing that large language models reflect many of the same patterns of content effects on reasoning that are observed in humans. Specifically, the paper finds that the performance of large language models on logical reasoning tasks depends on the content and context of the reasoning problems in ways that parallel known biases and limitations of human reasoning. For example, the models reason more accurately about logical rules grounded in realistic situations compared to arbitrary abstract rules, mirroring findings from classic experiments like the Wason selection task. The authors argue these findings have implications for both cognitive science and AI safety research in terms of understanding the factors that affect reasoning in intelligent systems. Overall, the key contribution appears to be using language models as a tool to gain insight into human cognitive biases and their computational basis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in abstract reasoning and content effects:

- The use of large language models to investigate human reasoning biases is a relatively new approach. Most prior work has studied these effects in humans directly through behavioral experiments. Using language models allows testing hypotheses and generating new predictions at scale. 

- The paper comprehensively evaluates three different reasoning paradigms that have been extensively studied in cognitive science - natural language inference, syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. Connecting findings across these diverse tasks strengthens the case that language models mirror systematic human reasoning patterns.

- The results support the view that both humans and large language models exhibit context-dependent, content-sensitive reasoning. This contrasts with some assumptions that neural networks behave in a purely heuristic or statistical manner. The paper argues that a unitary model can capture varied human-like behaviors through interaction of knowledge and context.

- The paper integrates these findings with other recent work probing systematicity and abstract reasoning abilities of large language models. It emphasizes the limitations and biases in language model reasoning, while also highlighting how targeted training may improve model reasoning.

- The cognitive modeling approach complements other lines of research using language models to reconstruct patterns of human neural activity during language processing. Linking behavioral and neural levels of analysis is an exciting direction for future work.

In summary, this paper makes connections between several literatures on human reasoning, cognitive biases, and language model capabilities. The empirical findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human-like reasoning in large models. The work highlights opportunities to further develop and improve reasoning abilities in language models through targeted training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Further investigating the similarities between the internal computations of large language models like transformers and human neural/cognitive processing during reasoning tasks. The authors suggest this could lead to new hypotheses about the computational basis of human reasoning.

- Causally manipulating features of the training process for language models to understand how different types of experience may lead to the emergence of human-like content biases in reasoning. This could offer insight into the origins of these biases in humans.

- Exploring whether strategies that improve human logical reasoning and make it less dependent on content, like formal education, could also work to improve language models. For example, training language models to follow instructions better, verify and correct their own outputs, etc.

- Using language models as a "baseline" to generate new hypotheses about human reasoning biases, since they seem to mirror a range of biases. Then testing whether humans actually show those same biases.

- Further probing the limitations of language models as models of human reasoning, by testing them in more interactive, grounded, social situations and comparing to human performance.

- Investigating whether language models can learn to adapt their reasoning in a context-sensitive way, trading off between heuristics and more abstract logic as humans are thought to do.

So in summary, the authors lay out a research agenda focused on better understanding the connections between language models and human reasoning at multiple levels, from neural representations to overall behavioral patterns, and using insights from one to inform research on the other.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores whether large language models show similar content effects to humans when performing logical reasoning tasks. The authors evaluate language models on three reasoning tasks: natural language inference, assessing the validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. Across these tasks, they find that the language models reflect many of the same biases observed in human reasoning. For example, the models are more likely to accept invalid logical arguments as valid if the conclusion is consistent with common sense knowledge, similar to human "belief bias". The models also struggle with abstract versions of the Wason selection task, but perform better when it is framed realistically, paralleling findings in humans. Overall, the results suggest that the knowledge and biases learned by language models through pretraining lead them to mimic human errors and content effects during logical reasoning, rather than behaving as pure symbolic reasoners. The authors argue this highlights the difficulty of context-independent reasoning, and propose directions for future work on improving reasoning in language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models show similar biases to humans in logical reasoning tasks. The authors generate new datasets for three reasoning tasks to avoid training data contamination: natural language inference, assessing the validity of syllogistic arguments, and the Wason selection task. They evaluate large transformer models with 7 billion and 70 billion parameters on these datasets. The models exhibit several parallels with human reasoning biases. On natural language inference, they are more accurate when the inferences are consistent with real world knowledge compared to inferences that violate expectations or use nonsense words. On syllogisms, they are biased to judge arguments as valid when the conclusion is believable, mirroring human “belief bias”. On the Wason selection task, they perform better on realistic rules about familiar situations than arbitrary rules over abstract attributes, paralleling the human difficulty with abstract reasoning. The authors argue these parallels illustrate the importance of prior knowledge and content for reasoning in both humans and large language models. The results have implications for cognitive science by providing a computational basis for human reasoning phenomena, and for AI safety by delineating when models may fail to reason logically.

In summary, this paper demonstrates that large language models exhibit a range of human-like biases when performing logical reasoning tasks. The authors generate new reasoning datasets to avoid training data contamination. They find models are substantially influenced by prior knowledge and content, mirroring effects from the cognitive literature like belief bias and the difficulty of abstract reasoning. The results illustrate the graded, knowledge-dependent nature of reasoning in both humans and language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models show similar content effects as humans on logical reasoning tasks. The authors generate new datasets for three reasoning tasks to avoid training data contamination: simple natural language inference, assessing the validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. For each task, they create multiple versions that keep the logical structure constant but manipulate the content - using entities that are consistent with knowledge, violate knowledge, or are nonsense words. They evaluate language models with 7 billion and 70 billion parameters on these datasets in both zero-shot and few-shot conditions. The models are scored by comparing the likelihood of possible answers in the context of the question to a baseline. The authors find that across all three tasks, the language models mirror patterns of human reasoning biases - performing better when content is consistent with knowledge versus violating knowledge or being abstract. Their results demonstrate that like humans, the reasoning abilities of large language models depend substantially on the content and context of the problem.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is investigating whether large language models show similar content effects on reasoning as humans do. In particular, whether language models reason more effectively about entities and relationships that are consistent with their "knowledge" gained through training, compared to abstract or nonsensical entities.

- Humans are known to exhibit "belief bias" in reasoning - they reason more accurately about situations that match their prior knowledge and expectations, compared to unfamiliar or abstract scenarios. But language models have been criticized for inconsistencies or biases in their reasoning abilities. 

- The authors generate datasets for three reasoning tasks - natural language inference, assessing validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. For each task they create versions with realistic, abstract, and nonsensical content.

- They find that large language models do indeed exhibit similar biases to humans across these tasks - performing better when reasoning about believable situations grounded in real knowledge, compared to abstract scenarios.

- The authors suggest their findings have implications for both cognitive science and AI safety research. The similarities in reasoning patterns between humans and LMs could offer insights into the origins of human reasoning. And understanding factors affecting LM reasoning is important for developing reliable AI systems.

In summary, the key question is whether LMs show human-like biases in reasoning due to content and prior knowledge, rather than performing pure abstract reasoning. The findings suggest that reasoning in LMs is a graded capacity shaped by knowledge and experience, much like human cognition.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper investigates whether large language models exhibit human-like biases in logical reasoning, specifically "content effects" where reasoning is facilitated when problem content matches real-world knowledge. The authors evaluated several state-of-the-art language models (e.g. Chinchilla, PaLM, GPT-3.5), as well as human participants, on three reasoning tasks: natural language inference, syllogistic reasoning, and the Wason selection task. In each task, problems were generated in different versions with content that was belief-consistent, belief-violating, or nonsense. 

Across all three tasks, the authors found that both humans and language models demonstrated superior reasoning performance when content was consistent with real-world knowledge, compared to belief-violating or nonsense content. For example, on syllogisms, both humans and models were more likely to accurately judge an argument as valid when the conclusion was believable. On the challenging Wason selection task, both humans and models succeeded more often on problems framed in a realistic context compared to abstract rules.

The authors argue these parallels indicate contemporary language models, trained on human-generated text, implicitly acquire human-like semantic biases which interact with and facilitate logical reasoning in context-sensitive ways, similar to humans. Furthermore, model confidence was related to human response times, suggesting similarities in underlying reasoning processes. 

Overall, this work demonstrates that modern language models mirror the imperfect, content-entangled reasoning exhibited by humans across diverse logical tasks. The authors discuss implications for better understanding human cognition, as well as developing more human-like reasoning abilities in AI systems.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores whether language models show human-like biases in logical reasoning tasks. The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art language models on three reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. They find that, much like humans, the language models are substantially influenced by the semantic content of the reasoning problems. For example, the models are more likely to accept syllogisms as valid if the conclusion is believable, even when the argument is logically invalid. Similarly, the models perform better on Wason selection problems framed in a realistic context compared to more abstract versions, mirroring the content effects observed in humans. The authors argue these findings have implications for debates on the nature of reasoning in both humans and artificial intelligences. The results suggest reasoning may be an inherently graded, content-sensitive capacity not reliant on purely symbolic manipulation. They propose language models may learn to arbitrate contextually between intuitive responses and more analytic ones, as hypothesized for human reasoning.
