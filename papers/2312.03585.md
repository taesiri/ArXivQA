# [Foundation Model Assisted Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03585)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel coarse-to-fine framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) that leverages both CLIP and SAM models. The framework jointly performs an image classification task and a segmentation seed generation task using a frozen CLIP model with two sets of learned task-specific prompts. It generates a coarse segmentation seed map from the classification task, which is then used to supervise the learning of finer seed maps from the segmentation task. A SAM-based seeding module is designed to refine the CAMs from both tasks into seed maps by leveraging SAM's ability to produce semantic quasi-superpixels. Additionally, a multi-label contrastive loss and a CAM activation loss are introduced to effectively train the classification and segmentation prompt embeddings. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and very competitive results on MS COCO 2014. The framework is efficient as it only requires learning the prompt embeddings while keeping CLIP frozen. Moreover, the SAM-based seeding is shown to be more effective and efficient than commonly used refinement techniques like CRFs.

The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine framework that leverages CLIP and SAM to jointly perform image classification and segmentation tasks for generating high-quality segmentation seeds in weakly supervised semantic segmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a coarse-to-fine framework that leverages both CLIP and SAM to generate high-quality segmentation seeds for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The framework jointly performs an image classification task and a seed segmentation task using a frozen CLIP model with two sets of learned task-specific prompts.

2. It designs a SAM-based seeding (SAMS) module that is applied at the seed generation stage to produce either coarse or fine seeds from the class activation maps. Compared to dense CRF or affinity learning used in prior works, SAMS generates better refinement results more efficiently.  

3. It introduces a multi-label contrastive loss relying on image-level labels and a CAM activation loss relying on the coarse seeds to supervise the learning of the two sets of prompts. The prompts are the only parts that need to be learned in the framework.

4. Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and very competitive results on MS COCO 2014 for weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning two sets of prompts - one for classification and one for segmentation. Why is it beneficial to have separate prompts for these two tasks rather than shared prompts? How do the requirements of the prompts differ?

2. The paper introduces a SAM-based seeding module to generate segmentation seeds. What are the key steps in this module and how does it improve upon using raw CAMs or a dense CRF? What are the limitations?

3. The paper designs two losses - a multi-label contrastive loss and a CAM activation loss. Why are these losses better suited than standard losses like binary cross entropy or pixel-wise cross entropy? How specifically do they help learn better prompts?

4. The proposed framework keeps the CLIP model frozen while only learning the prompts. What are the advantages of this approach compared to fine-tuning the CLIP model itself? Are there any scenarios where fine-tuning CLIP could be beneficial?

5. How does the proposed coarse-to-fine framework using classification and segmentation tasks in tandem help produce better quality segmentation seeds? What are the failure cases where the coarse seeds may still be unreliable?

6. Qualitatively, how do the segmentation seeds produced by the proposed approach differ from prior arts? Are there still certain challenging cases like elongated, color-variant, or overlapping objects where seeds could be further improved? 

7. The paper achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012 but is slightly lower than a concurrent work on COCO. What factors contribute to this performance difference on the two datasets?

8. For real-world application, how could the proposed framework be adapted or modified to handle scenarios with incremental/continual classes over time rather than a fixed set of classes?

9. What are the limitations in directly using SAM masks for semantic segmentation as they lack explicit class labels? Can the proposed quasi-superpixel classification scheme effectively overcome this limitation in all cases?

10. The proposed framework relies only on image-level labels. Could incorporating point or scribble supervision further boost performance? What modifications would be needed to the overall framework?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using only image-level labels is an important but challenging problem. Existing methods rely on class activation maps (CAMs) as the initial seeds, but CAMs tend to focus on discriminative object parts and fail to capture complete object regions. Recent works started leveraging foundation models like CLIP and SAM, but how to effectively integrate them into the WSSS framework remains under-explored.

Method: 
This paper proposes a coarse-to-fine framework to generate high-quality segmentation seeds by incorporating both CLIP and SAM. Specifically, it constructs two tasks - an image classification task and a segmentation seed generation task. Two sets of learnable prompts are designed to enable a frozen CLIP model to effectively perform the two tasks. The framework operates in a coarse-to-fine manner. The classification task generates a coarse seed supervised by a multi-label contrastive loss using image labels. Then the coarse seed supervises the segmentation task using a CAM activation loss to produce a fine seed. 

Additionally, a SAM-based seeding (SAMS) module is proposed. It first generates semantic quasi-superpixels from SAM masks. Then it assigns semantic labels to quasi-superpixels based on CAMs and aggregates them into final seeds. SAMS is applied in both seed generation stages for refinement.

Contributions:
1) A prompt learning based coarse-to-fine framework to progressively improve seeds by combining classification and segmentation tasks.

2) A SAM-based seeding module that takes advantage of SAM masks to generate high-quality seeds superior than using CRF or AffinityNet.

3) Customized losses for learning the classification and segmentation prompts in a weakly supervised manner.

4) State-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and very competitive results on MS COCO 2014.
