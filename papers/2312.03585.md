# [Foundation Model Assisted Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03585)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel coarse-to-fine framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) that leverages both CLIP and SAM models. The framework jointly performs an image classification task and a segmentation seed generation task using a frozen CLIP model with two sets of learned task-specific prompts. It generates a coarse segmentation seed map from the classification task, which is then used to supervise the learning of finer seed maps from the segmentation task. A SAM-based seeding module is designed to refine the CAMs from both tasks into seed maps by leveraging SAM's ability to produce semantic quasi-superpixels. Additionally, a multi-label contrastive loss and a CAM activation loss are introduced to effectively train the classification and segmentation prompt embeddings. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and very competitive results on MS COCO 2014. The framework is efficient as it only requires learning the prompt embeddings while keeping CLIP frozen. Moreover, the SAM-based seeding is shown to be more effective and efficient than commonly used refinement techniques like CRFs.
