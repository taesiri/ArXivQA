# [Learning-driven Physically-aware Large-scale Circuit Gate Sizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Gate sizing plays an important role in timing optimization after physical design. However, existing machine learning-based gate sizing works cannot optimize timing on multiple timing paths simultaneously and neglect the physical constraint on layouts. This causes sub-optimal sizing solutions and low efficiency compared to commercial tools. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a learning-driven physically-aware gate sizing framework to efficiently optimize timing on large-scale circuits. The key ideas are:

(1) Multi-modal timing model: Learn timing information on multiple paths and physical information on multi-scale layouts to accurately model timing optimization and degradation caused by gate sizing. Optimization information from the commercial tool ICC2 is used to guide the gradient.  

(2) Gradient optimization: Generate accurate discrete gradients of the timing model w.r.t. gate sizes using a size-oriented straight-through estimator. Propagate gradients with different priorities on gates using adaptive sampling to effectively update sizes.

Main Contributions:

- First work to achieve physically-aware gate sizing via a learning-driven framework for effective and efficient timing optimization on large circuits.

- Achieve highly accurate multi-modal timing modeling by aggregating timing information on multiple paths and physical information on multi-scale layouts. Utilize ICC2 optimization information to guide the model gradient.

- Develop a size-oriented estimator for accurate gradient generation and adaptive gradient backpropagation for effective gate size update.

- Evaluation on 16nm designs shows 16.29%/18.61% higher WNS/TNS improvement over ICC2 commercial tool, with 6.64Ã— speedup. Demonstrates generalizability across designs without retraining.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a learning-driven physically-aware gate sizing framework to efficiently optimize timing performance on large-scale circuits by modeling timing and physical information in a multi-modal way and generating/propagating gradients effectively for discrete gate size update.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a learning-driven framework to achieve physically-aware gate-sizing for the first time. This framework can optimize timing performance effectively on large-scale circuits.

2. It achieves multi-modal gate sizing-aware timing modeling via aggregating timing information on multiple critical paths and physical information on multiple scaled layouts. The optimization information from the commercial tool Synopsys IC-Compiler II is also utilized to guide the gradients.

3. It performs gate sizing based on size gradients of the timing model. A sizing-oriented straight-through estimator is developed to efficiently generate size gradients for discrete functions. An adaptive gradient back-propagation method is used to update gate sizes effectively.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel learning-driven optimization framework for gate sizing that jointly leverages timing, physical, and optimization information to achieve efficient and optimized results on large designs. The multi-modal modeling and adaptive gradient techniques are key to the performance.
