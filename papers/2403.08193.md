# [Learning-driven Physically-aware Large-scale Circuit Gate Sizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Gate sizing plays an important role in timing optimization after physical design. However, existing machine learning-based gate sizing works cannot optimize timing on multiple timing paths simultaneously and neglect the physical constraint on layouts. This causes sub-optimal sizing solutions and low efficiency compared to commercial tools. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a learning-driven physically-aware gate sizing framework to efficiently optimize timing on large-scale circuits. The key ideas are:

(1) Multi-modal timing model: Learn timing information on multiple paths and physical information on multi-scale layouts to accurately model timing optimization and degradation caused by gate sizing. Optimization information from the commercial tool ICC2 is used to guide the gradient.  

(2) Gradient optimization: Generate accurate discrete gradients of the timing model w.r.t. gate sizes using a size-oriented straight-through estimator. Propagate gradients with different priorities on gates using adaptive sampling to effectively update sizes.

Main Contributions:

- First work to achieve physically-aware gate sizing via a learning-driven framework for effective and efficient timing optimization on large circuits.

- Achieve highly accurate multi-modal timing modeling by aggregating timing information on multiple paths and physical information on multi-scale layouts. Utilize ICC2 optimization information to guide the model gradient.

- Develop a size-oriented estimator for accurate gradient generation and adaptive gradient backpropagation for effective gate size update.

- Evaluation on 16nm designs shows 16.29%/18.61% higher WNS/TNS improvement over ICC2 commercial tool, with 6.64Ã— speedup. Demonstrates generalizability across designs without retraining.
