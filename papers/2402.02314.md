# [Selecting Large Language Model to Fine-tune via Rectified Scaling Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02314)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing ecosystem of large language models (LLMs), posing the challenge of selecting the most appropriate pre-trained model to fine-tune. 
- Given limited resources like time, computation, and storage, it is infeasible to fine-tune all candidate models and compare. Intuitive selection methods also fail.
- The difficulty in predicting full fine-tuning performance given limited resources connects to understanding scaling laws in fine-tuning.

Key Observations:
- Unlike pre-training, the fine-tuning scaling curve shows a "phase transition" - a pre-power phase where slope decreases, followed by the power phase where loss and data size are linearly correlated in log-log scale.
- Existing scaling laws fail to capture this transition both theoretically and empirically.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a "pre-learned data size" term into the scaling law, indicating data size pre-learned from pre-training relevant for the downstream task.
- This overcomes limitations of previous laws and fits experimental results much better.

Main Contributions:
- Establish rectified scaling law of LLM fine-tuning incorporating pre-learned data size, which fits phase transition behavior.
- Propose LLM selection algorithm "Accept then Stop" that leverages the law - distinguishes phases in scaling curve and extrapolates full performance.
- Demonstrate superior and consistent performance over baselines, selecting near optimal models with hundreds of times less resources.

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper including the problem definition, limitations of existing work, proposed solutions, and highlights the main contributions around the rectified scaling law and LLM selection algorithm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper establishes a new scaling law for fine-tuning large language models that captures a phase transition phenomenon in low-data regimes, and leverages this law to design an efficient algorithm for selecting the best model to fine-tune that makes accurate predictions with hundreds of times less resource consumption compared to current approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formulates the problem of LLM selection for fine-tuning for the first time, and connects it to the study of scaling laws. 

2. It reveals inadequacies in existing scaling laws for modeling the fine-tuning process, by discovering a previously unseen "pre-power phase" in the low data regime. It further theoretically explains why existing laws fail, and proposes a rectified law that captures the phase transition much better.

3. Based on the new scaling law, it designs a novel LLM selection algorithm called "Accept then Stop" (AtS) that leverages the phase transition phenomenon to predict full fine-tuning performance using limited resources. Experiments show AtS can select near optimal models with hundreds of times less resources than baselines.

4. More broadly, this work advances our understanding towards scaling laws in practical downstream applications like fine-tuning, and provides a robust algorithmic solution to an important model selection problem amidst the ever-growing LLM ecosystem.

In summary, the key innovation is revealing phase transitions in fine-tuning scaling, fixing theoretical gaps in existing laws, and designing an efficient selection algorithm that works reliably based on the improved understanding.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Fine-tuning 
- Scaling laws
- Resource constraints
- Model selection
- Performance prediction
- Phase transition
- Pre-power phase
- Power phase
- Pre-learned data size
- Rectified scaling law
- Accept then Stop (AtS) algorithm

The paper focuses on selecting the optimal large language model to fine-tune given resource constraints, and connects this problem to understanding scaling laws that characterize how model performance improves with more data during fine-tuning. It reveals a phase transition phenomenon with a previously undiscovered "pre-power" phase in the low data regime. To better capture this, the authors introduce a rectified scaling law incorporating the concept of "pre-learned data size", which fits the experimental results much better. They then propose a new LLM selection algorithm called AtS based on distinguishing and extrapolating the linear power phase. AtS can select near-optimal models with much greater efficiency than baseline methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new concept called "pre-learned data size" (Dl) to model the equivalent amount of downstream data that a model has pre-learned from its pre-training corpus. How is this concept incorporated into the proposed rectified scaling law and how does it help explain the phase transition phenomenon?

2. The paper discovers a "pre-power phase" in the fine-tuning scaling curve when the amount of fine-tuning data is small. What are the key properties of this phase and how is it different from the commonly studied "power phase"? 

3. The paper proposes the "Accept then Stop" (AtS) algorithm for LLM selection. Walk through the details of how this algorithm works and explain why it is designed this way based on the understanding of the scaling laws.

4. What are the theoretical guarantees for the proposed rectified scaling law? In particular, what does Theorem 2 tell us about its mathematical properties regarding the phase transition phenomenon?

5. The experiment uses 30 LLMs with diverse architectures and model sizes. What is the motivation behind using such a comprehensive set of models and what insights does it provide about the proposed method?  

6. Why do intuitive selection methods like ModelSize, ZeroShot, and SubTuning perform poorly in predicting full fine-tuning performance? Explain their limitations both conceptually and through experimental results.

7. The paper evaluates the proposed AtS algorithm extensively under different constraints on model families, GPU memory, hyperparameter choices, etc. Summarize the robustness of AtS shown in these ablation studies. 

8. The concept of "pre-learned data size" Dl captures inductive bias transferred from pre-training. What other factors may influence Dl and how can they be modeled?

9. Compare the proposed rectified scaling law with other concurrent works on fine-tuning scaling laws. What are the limitations of existing laws and how does the proposed law overcome them?

10. The paper focuses on supervised fine-tuning of auto-regressive models. What are other fine-tuning setups that the framework and algorithm may apply to? What adaptations may be needed?
