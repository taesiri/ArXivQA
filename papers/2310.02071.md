# [Towards End-to-End Embodied Decision Making via Multi-modal Large   Language Model: Explorations with GPT4-Vision and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02071)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can current state-of-the-art visual large language models (VLLMs) perform various embodied decision making tasks in an end-to-end manner? How do they compare to LLM-powered agents?

2) Can LLMs and VLLMs collaborate to enhance embodied decision-making capabilities?

The authors motivate these questions by discussing recent advances in VLLMs like GPT-4 Vision that have shown impressive capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning. However, it is unclear if these models can effectively handle embodied decision making in real-world environments. The authors also discuss how LLMs have been used to empower agents, but suffer from a modality gap due to their reliance on converting visual inputs to text. 

To address these questions, the authors propose a new benchmark called PCA-EVAL to evaluate embodied decision making from the perspectives of perception, cognition and action. They also introduce a framework called HOLMES that allows LLMs to gather multimodal information using VLLMs/APIs and collaborate to make decisions.

The central goal appears to be systematically comparing end-to-end decision making with VLLMs vs. the HOLMES approach across different models and assessing whether VLLMs can match or exceed LLM-based systems. The new benchmark is intended to facilitate this comparison and drive further research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a new benchmark called PCA-EVAL for evaluating embodied decision making abilities of agents from three perspectives: Perception, Cognition, and Action. This benchmark covers three domains - autonomous driving, domestic assistance, and game playing. 

2. Introducing a multi-agent cooperation framework called HOLMES that allows large language models (LLMs) to leverage different multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and APIs to gather information from the environment and make informed decisions.

3. Conducting a systematic comparison of two embodied decision making methods - end-to-end and HOLMES - across different models. The key finding is that the latest GPT4-Vision model demonstrates strong end-to-end decision making abilities, outperforming even the top LLM-based HOLMES model. However, this level of performance seems exclusive to GPT4-Vision which substantially surpasses current open-source MLLMs.

In summary, the main contributions are: proposing the PCA-EVAL benchmark, the HOLMES framework, and evaluations showing the promise of powerful end-to-end MLLMs like GPT4-Vision for embodied decision making. The benchmark and framework aim to enable further research in this area.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of this paper, here are some key points in comparing it to other related work:

- This paper proposes a new evaluation benchmark called PCA-EVAL for assessing embodied decision-making abilities of AI agents across three perspectives - perception, cognition, and action. This provides a more comprehensive evaluation than just looking at final rewards or success rates as in some existing embodied AI benchmarks. The multi-domain coverage of autonomous driving, domestic robots, and games also allows testing generalization across different environments.

- The paper introduces a multi-agent cooperation framework called HOLMES that allows LLMs to gather multimodal information by invoking different vision models/APIs. This is a novel approach to enabling LLMs to handle embodied tasks with visual inputs compared to just converting everything to text which can lose information.

- The study provides an extensive empirical comparison between end-to-end decision making with VLLMs versus the HOLMES approach on the new PCA-EVAL benchmark. Key findings are that the latest GPT4-Vision model substantially outperforms prior VLLMs in end-to-end evaluation, and outperforms even GPT4-HOLMES, showing the promise of advanced VLLMs for embodied tasks.

- Compared to prior work that studied LLM-based decision making primarily in text domains, this paper makes progress in assessing decision-making grounded in visual and embodied environments. The new benchmark and framework could catalyze more research in this direction.

- A limitation is the current small scale of the PCA-EVAL benchmark (300 instances across 3 domains). Expanding to more domains and instances, and developing automated evaluation could build on this preliminary research.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions around new evaluation methodology, models, and findings to advance research on LLM-based decision making in embodied agents. The results highlight the promise of state-of-the-art VLLMs while also pointing to many open challenges.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more comprehensive benchmarks with additional domains and a larger number of instances per domain. The authors suggest expanding the current PCA-EVAL benchmark to encompass more domains and embodied environments to provide more feedback for MLLMs. They also propose increasing the number of instances for existing and new domains.

- Automating the evaluation process for perception and cognition scores. Currently, only the action score is evaluated automatically. The authors aim to develop automated systems to evaluate perception and cognition as well to make the PCA-EVAL benchmark more efficient and easy to use.

- Exploring the decision-making alignment between agents and human values. The authors discuss cases where agent decisions contradict human values despite being logically sound. They highlight the need for embodied agents to make decisions harmonizing with human values.

- Comparing more models with the PCA-EVAL benchmark. The authors suggest evaluating more end-to-end and HOLMES-based models using PCA-EVAL as an effective embodied decision-making metric.

- Developing more advanced open-source MLLMs. The authors note the performance gap between proprietary models like GPT-4V and existing open-source MLLMs. They suggest continued research into developing more powerful open-source MLLMs.

- Exploring other collaboration methods between LLMs and MLLMs. Beyond the HOLMES framework, the authors propose investigating other ways LLMs and MLLMs can work together to enhance embodied decision making.

In summary, the key directions are developing more comprehensive benchmarks, automating evaluation, ensuring human value alignment, comparing more models, advancing open-source MLLMs, and exploring alternative LLM-MLLM collaboration.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called PCA-EVAL for evaluating embodied decision making abilities of AI agents across three perspectives - perception, cognition, and action. It consists of 300 multimodal multiple choice questions spanning three domains - autonomous driving, domestic robotics, and open-world gaming. Unlike traditional RL evaluation methods based on cumulative rewards, PCA-EVAL breaks down sequential tasks into individual decision steps that can be assessed independently. The paper also presents a multi-agent framework called HOLMES that allows language models to gather multimodal information using various APIs and models before making a decision. Experiments compare end-to-end decision making by visual LLMs like GPT-4 Vision versus the HOLMES approach on the PCA-EVAL benchmark. Key findings are that GPT-4 Vision demonstrates strong end-to-end decision making, outperforming GPT4-HOLMES on accuracy and cognition metrics. However its superior performance over other models highlights the need for more advanced open source VLLMs. Overall the work underscores the promise of VLLMs for embodied decision making and introduces a valuable benchmark to advance progress in this emerging area.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PCA-EVAL, a new benchmark for evaluating embodied decision making in AI agents across three key dimensions: perception, cognition, and action. The benchmark consists of 300 multimodal multiple choice questions covering three domains: autonomous driving, domestic robots, and open-world games. Each question includes an image, text question, answer choices, and annotations detailing the correct answer, reasoning, and key image concepts. This allows for granular assessment of an agent's visual perception, reasoning skills, and action selection abilities. 

The paper also introduces HOLMES, a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to collaborate with vision models and simulation APIs for embodied decision making. HOLMES provides the LLM with descriptions of available visual models and environment APIs to gather multimodal information relevant to a given question. The LLM reasons over this information through conversation to reach a final decision. Experiments compare end-to-end decision making with the latest vision-language model GPT-4V against HOLMES models. Results show GPT-4V exceeds HOLMES in accuracy, demonstrating the promise of end-to-end embodied decision making. But GPT-4V significantly outperforms other open source vision-language models, underscoring the need for advances in multimodal LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called PCA-EVAL for evaluating embodied decision making abilities of agents across three perspectives - perception, cognition, and action. The benchmark consists of 300 multimodal multiple choice questions covering three domains - autonomous driving, domestic assistance, and open-world gaming. Each instance in the benchmark includes an image, question, action candidates, answer, reasoning, and key concepts. The evaluation metrics include perception, cognition, and action scores to assess the agent's abilities in those three areas. The paper also introduces a multi-agent cooperation framework called HOLMES, where large language models like GPT-4 can invoke different visual models and APIs to gather clues and make informed decisions. The GPT-4 model using HOLMES is compared to end-to-end decision making using the latest visual large language model GPT-4V on the PCA-EVAL benchmark. The results show GPT-4V achieves 3% higher average decision accuracy compared to GPT-4 with HOLMES, demonstrating its strong end-to-end embodied decision making ability. However, this performance level is exclusive to GPT-4V, significantly outperforming other open-source models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main focus is on exploring the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for improving embodied decision-making in intelligent agents. Specifically, the paper is investigating the following research questions:

1) Can current state-of-the-art MLLMs perform various embodied decision making tasks in an end-to-end manner? How do they compare to LLM-powered agents?

2) Can LLMs and MLLMs collaborate to enhance embodied decision-making capabilities? 

The motivation is that while Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown success in decision-making for agents due to their reasoning skills and knowledge, they are limited to text and lack visual perception. MLLMs like GPT-4 Vision on the other hand have demonstrated stronger visual understanding and reasoning. So the paper is exploring whether MLLMs can handle embodied decision-making that requires perceiving and reasoning over multimodal observations, and if combining LLMs and MLLMs can further improve decision-making abilities.

In summary, the key focus is on leveraging MLLMs to enhance decision-making in embodied agents operating in environments with multimodal observations, and comparing MLLM-based approaches to LLM-based methods. The paper aims to provide analysis and insights on the current capabilities and limitations of using MLLMs for embodied decision-making.
