# [Self-supervised Learning of Geometrically Stable Features Through   Probabilistic Introspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01552)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper addresses the question of how to extend self-supervision to tasks involving understanding geometric properties of objects, particularly semantic matching and part detection. The central hypothesis is that learning dense visual descriptors from unlabeled images using synthetic image transformations and a probabilistic formulation can produce features suitable for these geometry-oriented tasks without requiring manual annotations like bounding boxes or parts.The key ideas proposed are:1) Using a neural network to compute dense visual descriptors and training them for invariance on synthetic warped image pairs. 2) Incorporating a probabilistic formulation that allows the network to estimate matching reliability and handle difficult matches.3) Trading off descriptor generality for robustness compared to prior work, then fine-tuning with a small amount of supervised data.The paper tests the hypothesis by pre-training networks this way and showing they outperform other self-supervision methods on semantic matching and few-shot part detection benchmarks, achieving results on par with fully-supervised approaches.
