# Mass-Producing Failures of Multimodal Systems with Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the LaTeX code provided, this does not appear to be a full paper draft but rather a LaTeX template for formatting a paper to NeurIPS 2023 submission guidelines. Some key things I noticed:- There is boilerplate code for setting up the document in NeurIPS format, including packages, macros, commands, etc. - There are placeholders for the paper title, author list, abstract, and section headings, but no actual content filled in.- There are some generic commands defined (e.g. \fig for inserting figures) but no specific figures included.- There is code for citations and a bibliography, but no references filled in. - There are template appendix sections, but no real appendix content.So in summary, this seems to be a LaTeX template for formatting a NeurIPS paper, but does not contain an actual full paper with research content. Without seeing the full paper content, I cannot deduce the central research question or hypothesis being addressed. The template itself does not pose a research question, it just provides an outline and formatting for writing up the research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces MultiMon, a system for automatically identifying systematic failures of multimodal AI systems. The key ideas are:- Exploiting "erroneous agreement" to scrape corpora for individual failures. The system looks for input pairs that produce similar CLIP embeddings but have different semantics, indicating a failure.- Using large language models like GPT-4 to categorize the individual failures into generalizable, natural language descriptions of systematic failures. - Steering the system to uncover failures relevant to a specific application domain or use case.- Showing that failures in CLIP's text encoder transfer to downstream systems like image and video generators, since they rely on CLIP.The main contribution is developing this pipeline - scraping with erroneous agreement, categorizing with language models, and steering - to automatically find impactful failures without manual effort. The paper shows this can uncover 14 failures of CLIP's text encoder, which in turn break state-of-the-art multimodal systems. The approach is systematic, human-compatible, and could be a foundation for broader automated evaluation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review of the paper, here are some thoughts on how it compares to related work:- The paper introduces a novel system, \ours{}, for automatically identifying systematic failures of multimodal systems like image and video generators. This goal of finding generalizable patterns of failure seems unique compared to prior work. Most prior efforts focus on either manually specifying or testing for specific kinds of failures, rather than autonomously discovering new ones.- The core idea of exploiting erroneous agreement between inputs seems new. Prior efforts like RED testing typically require hand-crafted input pairs that evaluators expect may produce the same output. In contrast, \ours{} searches a corpus for such pairs automatically by comparing CLIP embeddings. This allows it to be more systematic.- Using large language models like GPT-4 to categorize and generalize failures is also a relatively new technique. Some prior work uses language models to generate instances of assumed failure modes, but not to autonomously find the modes themselves. The ability of LLMs to draw conclusions from examples is key to the \ours{} approach.- Overall, the end-to-end pipeline of scraping with erroneous agreement, then categorizing and generating with LLMs seems unique. This combination allows \ours{} to be more systematic than prior failure testing methods. The simplicity of comparing embeddings lends itself to finding large volumes of failures.- That said, there is related work on identifying "slices" of poor model performance, and having humans or LLMs describe them. The difference is that prior work requires ground truth labels, whereas \ours{} only needs inputs and outputs. This generalization beyond supervised classification settings seems powerful.In summary, \ours{} pushes forward key aspects of automatic failure finding like utilizing erroneous agreement, leveraging scaling LLMs, and not requiring ground truth data. The work shows how these techniques can enable more systematic model evaluation.
