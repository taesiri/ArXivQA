# Mass-Producing Failures of Multimodal Systems with Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the LaTeX code provided, this does not appear to be a full paper draft but rather a LaTeX template for formatting a paper to NeurIPS 2023 submission guidelines. Some key things I noticed:- There is boilerplate code for setting up the document in NeurIPS format, including packages, macros, commands, etc. - There are placeholders for the paper title, author list, abstract, and section headings, but no actual content filled in.- There are some generic commands defined (e.g. \fig for inserting figures) but no specific figures included.- There is code for citations and a bibliography, but no references filled in. - There are template appendix sections, but no real appendix content.So in summary, this seems to be a LaTeX template for formatting a NeurIPS paper, but does not contain an actual full paper with research content. Without seeing the full paper content, I cannot deduce the central research question or hypothesis being addressed. The template itself does not pose a research question, it just provides an outline and formatting for writing up the research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces MultiMon, a system for automatically identifying systematic failures of multimodal AI systems. The key ideas are:- Exploiting "erroneous agreement" to scrape corpora for individual failures. The system looks for input pairs that produce similar CLIP embeddings but have different semantics, indicating a failure.- Using large language models like GPT-4 to categorize the individual failures into generalizable, natural language descriptions of systematic failures. - Steering the system to uncover failures relevant to a specific application domain or use case.- Showing that failures in CLIP's text encoder transfer to downstream systems like image and video generators, since they rely on CLIP.The main contribution is developing this pipeline - scraping with erroneous agreement, categorizing with language models, and steering - to automatically find impactful failures without manual effort. The paper shows this can uncover 14 failures of CLIP's text encoder, which in turn break state-of-the-art multimodal systems. The approach is systematic, human-compatible, and could be a foundation for broader automated evaluation.
