# [Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent   Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can engaging multiple language model agents in a debate process improve the factual correctness and reasoning abilities of the models? The key hypothesis is that by having multiple language model instances propose individual responses and then debate/critique each other's responses over multiple rounds, the models will converge on more accurate and well-reasoned final answers. The paper aims to test whether this "society of minds" approach can enhance the capabilities of large language models.In summary, the central research question is whether a multi-agent debate process can improve the factual validity and reasoning accuracy of language models, beyond what is possible with single model prompting techniques. The hypothesis is that debate will lead to more robust final answers by allowing models to reconcile conflicting viewpoints and chains of reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to improve the factual correctness and reasoning abilities of large language models through a multi-agent debate process. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using multiple copies/instances of a language model to independently generate candidate responses to a query. - Then having each model instance read and critique the responses of the other models and update their own response accordingly. - Repeating this debate process over multiple rounds to arrive at a final common consensus answer. - Showing through experiments on a variety of reasoning, factuality and QA tasks that this multi-agent debate approach significantly improves performance over single model baselines.- Introducing a new benchmark to evaluate factual correctness of biographies generated by language models.- Analyzing the effect of different design choices like number of agents, rounds of debate, debate prompts etc. on the quality of the final generated responses.So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of a multi-agent debate procedure to enhance reasoning, factuality and language generation in large language models. The paper shows improvements across several tasks with minimal changes to the base model.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a multi-agent debate approach where multiple language model instances propose, critique, and refine their responses over multiple rounds to arrive at more accurate and reasoned final answers compared to traditional inference with a single model instance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of improving reasoning and factuality in language models:- The use of multi-agent debate between separate language model instances is a novel approach not explored much before in prior work. Most prior work has focused on improving a single model through prompting techniques, additional training objectives, or retrieval. Having multiple models debate solutions is an interesting alternative direction.- The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating factual correctness in language models through biography generation. Many prior benchmarks focus more on logical reasoning abilities. Evaluating factuality is an important complementary metric that is not studied as extensively.- The authors demonstrate multi-agent debate improves performance across a diverse set of reasoning, factuality, and QA tasks. Many prior methods are more narrowly focused on specific tasks or model architectures. The generality of the approach is a strength.- The simplicity of the debate prompting approach to work on black-box models is also notable. It does not require model architecture changes or gradients. This allows it to work on existing public models.- Using debate to elicit and resolve inconsistent facts between models is a compelling result. Other techniques often try to directly estimate uncertainty, while debate acts as a way to surface and resolve uncertainty.- The computational expense of running debates between multiple models is a limitation compared to single model approaches. But the authors discuss how the data generated could further improve the base model.Overall, I would say this paper explores a novel direction of using deliberation between separate models to improve reasoning and factuality. The generality of the approach across diverse tasks, simplicity of implementation, and ability to surface inconsistent facts are notable strengths compared to prior work. The computational expense is a tradeoff that may be mitigated as models improve.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Applying the multiagent debate approach to other language model architectures besides the ones tested in the paper (e.g. GPT-3, PaLM, Chinchilla). The authors suggest this could further improve performance.- Exploring different ways to initialize the prompts and personas given to each agent at the start of the debate. The authors found giving different prompts improves performance on the MMLU task.- Using multiagent debate to generate additional training data to further improve the base language models, creating a self-improvement loop.- Mitigating the increased computational expense of running multiagent debates by summarizing agent responses instead of concatenating all responses directly. The authors show this improves performance when there are many agents.- Applying multiagent debate to even more complex reasoning and language tasks beyond the ones explored in the paper.- Improving the ability of language models to express uncertainty during the debate, so they don't confidently converge on incorrect answers. The authors suggest this could further improve multiagent debate.- Developing better automated metrics to evaluate the factual correctness of generated text, beyond the biography evaluation approach proposed in the paper.- Exploring the use of different language model types interacting in the debate, not just multiple copies of the same model.In summary, key directions are improving debate efficiency, applying it to more tasks, integrating it with other prompting techniques, using debate to improve base models, and developing better ways to assess uncertainty and factual correctness during the debate process.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents an approach to improve the factual correctness and reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) through multi-agent debate. The key idea is to have multiple instances of an LLM propose individual responses to a query, then have each instance critique the responses of others and refine its own answer over multiple rounds of debate to reach a consensus. The authors evaluate their approach on a variety of reasoning, factuality, and question answering benchmarks, and find that it significantly outperforms single-instance baselines across tasks. The debate process induces models to construct consistent answers, omit uncertain facts, and arrive at correct solutions even when all models start with incorrect predictions. The approach works with black-box access to LLMs, combines well with prompting techniques, and could enable an LLM self-improvement loop. Overall, it provides an orthogonal way to enhance reasoning and factuality in LLMs using the power of debate between "society of minds."


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach to improve the factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by having multiple instances of a language model debate solutions to a given query. The key idea is that rather than just generating a single response to a question, multiple copies of the LLM generate individual responses. These responses are then shared between the LLM agents, and each agent provides critiques of the other agents' responses. Through multiple rounds of debate, the agents are able to refine their responses and arrive at a consensus. The authors evaluate their multi-agent debate approach on a variety of reasoning, factuality, and question answering tasks. They introduce a new benchmark to test factual accuracy of generating biographies. Their results show that the debate approach significantly outperforms single model baselines across the tasks. The debate helps prune inconsistent facts from biographies and improves mathematical reasoning. The number of debate rounds and agents are important hyperparameters. The approach works with different initialization prompts and model types. Overall, the paper demonstrates how debate between LLMs can greatly enhance their capabilities, paving the way for further advances in language generation and understanding.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a multi-agent debate approach to improve factual correctness and reasoning in language models. The key idea is to generate responses using multiple instances or "agents" of a language model, have them debate their individual responses over multiple rounds, and arrive at a consensus answer. Specifically, given a query, multiple language model agents first independently generate candidate answers. Then in each round of debate, each agent is given the responses of the other agents as context and asked to critique those responses and refine its own answer. This process of proposing responses, critiquing others, and refining one's own answer based on others is repeated over multiple rounds. The debate induces models to construct answers that are internally consistent and make sense in light of others' responses, leading to more accurate final answers. The method is evaluated on a variety of reasoning and fact-checking tasks and shown to significantly outperform single model baselines and majority voting, especially with more agents and rounds of debate. Overall, the multi-agent debate approach provides an orthogonal way to improve language generation without changing the underlying models themselves.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

This paper is addressing the issues of factual inaccuracy and flawed reasoning that can occur in large language models. Specifically, the authors note that contemporary large language models can confidently hallucinate facts or make implausible jumps in reasoning chains, likely due to being trained on massive but potentially unreliable internet text data. The key problem the paper aims to address is how to improve the factual validity and reasoning ability of large language models in a general way that requires only black-box access to the model.
