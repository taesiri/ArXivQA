# Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent   Debate

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can engaging multiple language model agents in a debate process improve the factual correctness and reasoning abilities of the models? The key hypothesis is that by having multiple language model instances propose individual responses and then debate/critique each other's responses over multiple rounds, the models will converge on more accurate and well-reasoned final answers. The paper aims to test whether this "society of minds" approach can enhance the capabilities of large language models.In summary, the central research question is whether a multi-agent debate process can improve the factual validity and reasoning accuracy of language models, beyond what is possible with single model prompting techniques. The hypothesis is that debate will lead to more robust final answers by allowing models to reconcile conflicting viewpoints and chains of reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to improve the factual correctness and reasoning abilities of large language models through a multi-agent debate process. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using multiple copies/instances of a language model to independently generate candidate responses to a query. - Then having each model instance read and critique the responses of the other models and update their own response accordingly. - Repeating this debate process over multiple rounds to arrive at a final common consensus answer. - Showing through experiments on a variety of reasoning, factuality and QA tasks that this multi-agent debate approach significantly improves performance over single model baselines.- Introducing a new benchmark to evaluate factual correctness of biographies generated by language models.- Analyzing the effect of different design choices like number of agents, rounds of debate, debate prompts etc. on the quality of the final generated responses.So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of a multi-agent debate procedure to enhance reasoning, factuality and language generation in large language models. The paper shows improvements across several tasks with minimal changes to the base model.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a multi-agent debate approach where multiple language model instances propose, critique, and refine their responses over multiple rounds to arrive at more accurate and reasoned final answers compared to traditional inference with a single model instance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of improving reasoning and factuality in language models:- The use of multi-agent debate between separate language model instances is a novel approach not explored much before in prior work. Most prior work has focused on improving a single model through prompting techniques, additional training objectives, or retrieval. Having multiple models debate solutions is an interesting alternative direction.- The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating factual correctness in language models through biography generation. Many prior benchmarks focus more on logical reasoning abilities. Evaluating factuality is an important complementary metric that is not studied as extensively.- The authors demonstrate multi-agent debate improves performance across a diverse set of reasoning, factuality, and QA tasks. Many prior methods are more narrowly focused on specific tasks or model architectures. The generality of the approach is a strength.- The simplicity of the debate prompting approach to work on black-box models is also notable. It does not require model architecture changes or gradients. This allows it to work on existing public models.- Using debate to elicit and resolve inconsistent facts between models is a compelling result. Other techniques often try to directly estimate uncertainty, while debate acts as a way to surface and resolve uncertainty.- The computational expense of running debates between multiple models is a limitation compared to single model approaches. But the authors discuss how the data generated could further improve the base model.Overall, I would say this paper explores a novel direction of using deliberation between separate models to improve reasoning and factuality. The generality of the approach across diverse tasks, simplicity of implementation, and ability to surface inconsistent facts are notable strengths compared to prior work. The computational expense is a tradeoff that may be mitigated as models improve.
