# [Deep Learning-Based Pilotless Spatial Multiplexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05158)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the feasibility of using machine learning to enable pilotless spatial multiplexing in MIMO systems. The authors propose jointly training the transmitter and receiver end-to-end, allowing the transmitter to learn optimized constellation shapes for each spatial stream that facilitate blind separation and detection by the receiver without needing channel estimation pilots. Simulations demonstrate that the learned pilotless scheme can match or exceed the performance of a conventional pilot-based system under some conditions. For example, with 16-QAM and a target BLER of 10%, the pilotless scheme provides gains of 15-20% in spectral efficiency depending on the SNR, by using all resource elements for data instead of pilots. However, at high SNRs and with 64-QAM, the performance starts to deteriorate compared to the conventional system. Overall, the paper shows promising results for using machine learning to achieve pilotless transmission and provides some insights into potential limitations that should be addressed as future work to make the approach more robust. Key open issues are studying the specific constellation shape requirements and improving high SNR performance with higher-order modulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the feasibility of using machine learning to train a MIMO transmitter and receiver end-to-end to communicate without any channel estimation pilots, showing that the learned pilotless scheme can outperform a conventional pilot-based system in terms of spectral efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and demonstrating a machine learning-based approach for achieving pilotless spatial multiplexing in MIMO systems. Specifically, the paper shows that by jointly training the transmitter and receiver, the transmitter can learn asymmetric constellation shapes for each spatial stream that facilitate completely blind separation and detection at the receiver without needing any channel estimation pilots. This pilotless transmission scheme is shown to provide gains of 15-20% in spectral efficiency compared to a conventional pilot-based MIMO system, depending on the SNR and modulation order. To my knowledge, this is the first demonstration of end-to-end learned pilotless spatial multiplexing for MIMO communications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Pilotless spatial multiplexing - The main focus of the paper is using machine learning to enable spatial multiplexing in MIMO systems without the need for pilot symbols for channel estimation.

- End-to-end learning - The transmitter and receiver are jointly learned in an end-to-end manner, with the channel model between them.

- Learned constellations - The transmitter constellation shapes are parametrized and learned to facilitate blind detection at the receiver side. 

- DeepRx - The neural network based receiver architecture utilized at the receiver side.

- Spectral efficiency - A key performance metric that is improved by 15-20% using the proposed pilotless scheme compared to a baseline with pilot symbols.

- Higher order modulations - Performance limitations are observed at high SNRs when using 64-QAM constellations.

So in summary, the key terms cover the machine learning based system, the end-to-end learning framework, the modulation and detection techniques, and performance metrics such as spectral efficiency.
