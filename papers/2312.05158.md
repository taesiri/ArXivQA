## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the feasibility of using machine learning to enable pilotless spatial multiplexing in MIMO systems. The authors propose jointly training the transmitter and receiver end-to-end, allowing the transmitter to learn optimized constellation shapes for each spatial stream that facilitate blind separation and detection by the receiver without needing channel estimation pilots. Simulations demonstrate that the learned pilotless scheme can match or exceed the performance of a conventional pilot-based system under some conditions. For example, with 16-QAM and a target BLER of 10%, the pilotless scheme provides gains of 15-20% in spectral efficiency depending on the SNR, by using all resource elements for data instead of pilots. However, at high SNRs and with 64-QAM, the performance starts to deteriorate compared to the conventional system. Overall, the paper shows promising results for using machine learning to achieve pilotless transmission and provides some insights into potential limitations that should be addressed as future work to make the approach more robust. Key open issues are studying the specific constellation shape requirements and improving high SNR performance with higher-order modulations.
