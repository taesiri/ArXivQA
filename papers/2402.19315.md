# [On the Existence of Static Equilibria of a Cable-Suspended Load with   Non-stopping Flying Carriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper investigates whether non-stop flights of aerial vehicles (like fixed-wing UAVs) are compatible with keeping a cable-suspended load static at a fixed pose for aerial manipulation tasks. 

- Previous works use multirotors that can stop midair, but have limited flight endurance. Non-stop aerial platforms like fixed-wings have longer endurance but cannot stop. 

- The aim is to enable long duration aerial manipulation by combining cable-suspended load manipulation with non-stop aerial carrier platforms.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

- Analyzes the cases of using 1, 2 and 3 flying carriers to keep a load static with non-stop flights

- Shows through analysis that 1 carrier cannot achieve it and 2 carriers also cannot maintain bounded internal forces while ensuring non-stop flights

- Key Contribution 1: Proves that 3 carriers can achieve non-stop flights with static load posing by properly controlling the internal forces and load orientation

- Highlights two degenerate cases with 3 carriers where non-stop flights cannot be ensured 

- Key Contribution 2: Provides a specific structured internal force trajectory parametrization based on cosine functions that enables achieving non-stop flights

- Validates the analysis through detailed simulations in Matlab/Simulink by modeling cable suspended load dynamics and robotic carriers 

- Simulations verify that 2 carriers cannot ensure non-stop flights but 3 carriers can using the proposed internal force trajectory parameterization

In summary, the key contribution is a formal proof and guidelines for achieving non-stop flight based aerial manipulation of cable suspended loads using 3 carriers, enabled by structured control of internal forces.
