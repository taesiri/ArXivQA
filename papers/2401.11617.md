# [A Survey on African Computer Vision Datasets, Topics and Researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11617)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper provides a survey of African computer vision research, with a focus on datasets, topics, and barriers faced by researchers. Computer vision is an important field but African research represents only 0.06% of top-tier publications over the past decade. There is a need to understand the state of computer vision research in Africa, encourage more work, and align research topics with community needs.

Approach:
The authors gathered 63,000 Scopus-indexed African computer vision publications from 2012-2022. They automatically categorized datasets using language models parsing abstracts. They also surveyed 115 African researchers on barriers they face. Analysis looked at dataset/topic taxonomy, publishing trends, collaboration patterns, and questionnaire results on barriers.

Key Findings:
- Catalogued 96 official and 33 unofficial African computer vision datasets, providing taxonomy of applications and tasks. Image classification and object detection were most common.
- Identified key research topics like image segmentation, remote sensing, document analysis - topics align with community needs.
- Publishing highly skewed to Northern and Southern Africa. Minimal African collaboration (3.9% of papers).  
- 0.06% of top-tier venue papers are African. No growth in numbers over time.
- Survey found lack of funding, resources, and datasets as top barriers. Need better courses, more collaboration, and projects to curate African datasets.

Contributions:
- First taxonomy of African computer vision datasets and analysis of research topics/trends
- Analysis of publishing venues and collaborations - evidence of global inequity
- Large scale survey revealing barriers faced by African researchers
- Underscores need to encourage more African computer vision research aligned with community needs

The paper provides a thorough analysis of the state of computer vision research in Africa, including datasets, topics, publishing trends, and barriers faced by researchers. It makes a case for empowering African researchers and institutions to advance research relevant to African communities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper surveys African computer vision research by analyzing datasets, topics, publishing trends, and researchers' perspectives to provide an overview of the field's current state in Africa.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to surveying the landscape of computer vision research in Africa:

1. It provides a taxonomy and catalog of African computer vision datasets, categorizing them by application area and computer vision task. Both officially published datasets and unofficial ones from challenges/data platforms are covered. 

2. It analyzes the topics and trends in African CV research, identifying the most common keywords and research areas pursued in different African regions. This provides insights into regional research focuses.

3. The paper documents publishing and collaboration trends over time, contrasting African vs international collaborations. It also highlights the very low African contribution (0.06%) to top-tier CV venues.  

4. A large-scale survey of 115 African CV researchers is presented, identifying key barriers faced as well as directions for improving the ecosystem. Lack of funding and datasets were commonly cited barriers.

In summary, the paper undertakes a broad survey across datasets, topics, publishing trends, and directly canvassing researcher perspectives - with the goal of understanding the state of computer vision research in Africa. The taxonomies, analyses, and survey results provide a valuable reference for future work in this area.

The paper provides a survey and taxonomy of computer vision datasets and topics from Africa. It analyzes African publications and researchers in the field of computer vision over the past decade. The study categorizes datasets, identifies key research topics and trends, examines publishing and collaboration patterns, and reports on a questionnaire about barriers facing African computer vision researchers.

Keywords reflect the main focus and contributions - surveying African computer vision landscape across datasets, topics, publications/researchers, and barriers. Taxonomies are created for datasets and topics. Analysis spans geo-temporal publishing trends, collaboration patterns, and a large-scale questionnaire. The terms cover the overall scope and key aspects of the survey paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a bottom-up approach for identifying and annotating African computer vision datasets by using large language models to analyze paper abstracts. What are the advantages of this bottom-up approach compared to a more traditional top-down taxonomy? How does it allow for more flexibility and inclusiveness?

2. The annotation process uses two labels per dataset paper selected either from a predefined list or created independently. What is the rationale behind allowing annotators to create new labels? How does this make the taxonomy more reflective of the actual research landscape? 

3. Conflict resolution between annotators is handled by bringing in a third senior researcher. What measures were taken to ensure consistency across annotations and conflict resolution decisions? How might the seniority impact inter-annotator agreement rates?

4. What ethical considerations guided the annotation process, particularly around privacy, consent, and the right to be forgotten? How were ethically concerning datasets handled? 

5. For the keywords analysis, terms like "Galaxies" emerged unexpectedly. What verification was done on seemingly out-of-scope keywords before including them in the taxonomy? What false positive rates were found?

6. Publication trends show minimal pan-African collaboration. What factors drive this lack of intra-continental collaboration? How can pan-African partnerships strengthen the research ecosystem?

7. The survey reveals consensus on barriers like funding and resources. How do regional differences in responses suggest tailored solutions may be needed? How to balance internal and external collaborations?

8. What biases might have been introduced by focusing only on English publications or peer-reviewed datasets? How might other African language publications or informal datasets shift the findings?

9. The survey collects perceptions from active researchers. How might including policymakers' perspectives provide more insight on addressing structural barriers? What incentives might encourage their participation? 

10. Future work proposes disseminating computer vision expertise via courses and schools. What pedagogical best practices should be considered in designing these resources? How to balance state-of-the-art techniques with community needs?
