# [Copyleft for Alleviating AIGC Copyright Dilemma: What-if Analysis,   Public Perception and Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12216)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an emerging dilemma regarding who owns the copyright for content generated by AI systems (AIGC). The three main stakeholders are data owners, model owners, and model users. 
- Granting copyright to any one stakeholder can negatively impact the other two, hindering development and adoption of AIGC. This is referred to as the "AIGC copyright dilemma".
- There is no perfect solution that satisfies all stakeholders. A "trade-off" solution is needed that balances interests and promotes AIGC development.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper explores using "copyleft" licenses for AIGC as a feasible way to alleviate the dilemma. 
- Copyleft grants freedoms to use and modify works, while requiring derivative works retain the same copyleft terms. This allows sharing while providing some protections.

Analysis:
- The paper conducts qualitative what-if analysis showing issues for each stakeholder getting full copyright.
- Case studies demonstrate copyleft could mitigate disputes by allowing sharing with attribution.
- A survey finds people understand the dilemma, prefer authorized AIGC use, and are positive about copyleft for AIGC.
- Regression modeling reveals factors impacting willingness to adopt copyleft. Concern over dilemmas and positivity towards copyleft increase willingness.

Main Contributions:
- Clarifies intricacies of AIGC copyright dilemma through formal what-if analysis.
- Provides first substantive feasibility analysis of using copyleft licenses to alleviate the dilemma.
- Mixed methods study combines formal analysis, case studies, survey, and modeling to evaluate copyleft for AIGC from multiple perspectives.
- Demonstrates public understanding of the dilemma and openness to copyleft, laying groundwork for further discussion and collaboration around implementing copyleft.

The paper makes a case for copyleft as a practical solution for the AIGC copyright dilemma worth further exploration, though the authors admit it is not perfect.
