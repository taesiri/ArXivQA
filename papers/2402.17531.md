# [Nissist: An Incident Mitigation Copilot based on Troubleshooting Guides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17531)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Effective and swift incident management is critical for ensuring reliability of enterprise-level cloud services. While automated pipelines can handle common low-severity incidents, complex high-severity incidents still require manual intervention by on-call engineers (OCEs).  
- OCEs rely on unstructured Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs) to mitigate incidents quickly. However, the unstructured nature of TSGs requires manual interpretation, leading to OCE fatigue and decreased productivity, especially for new hires.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Nissist, an AI copilot to assist OCEs in incident mitigation by providing proactive suggestions based on insights from TSGs and historical incident data.  
- Nissist extracts structured knowledge from unstructured TSGs into discrete nodes using quality criteria and large language models (LLMs). It further enriches this knowledge base using insights from historical incident mitigation discussions.
- A multi-agent system is designed to interpret OCE queries, retrieve relevant nodes, and suggest systematic mitigation plans to guide OCEs through each stage. This reduces reliance on direct human intervention.

Key Contributions:
- Establishes rigorous criteria and leverages LLMs to convert unstructured TSGs into structured, executable knowledge nodes.
- Constructs a comprehensive knowledge base combining insights from TSGs and historical incident data to capture up-to-date solutions.  
- Introduces an advanced multi-agent system that can proficiently understand queries, retrieve relevant nodes, and formulate actionable mitigation plans.
- Reduces time-to-mitigate and OCE workload, especially for complex and cross-team incidents, through systematic step-by-step guidance.
- Demonstrates efficacy via experiments showing 84-98% shorter time-to-mitigate using Nissist over manual process.
