# [Probabilistic Adaptation of Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt large pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks without expensive finetuning. The key hypothesis is that a pretrained text-to-video model captures a powerful prior over natural videos that can guide the generation of task-specific videos when combined with a small trainable model.The authors propose to leverage the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior and compose it with a small task-specific model to generate videos adapted to the downstream domain. This allows adapting the pretrained knowledge without modifying the weights of the large model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Video Adapter for adapting large pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks with limited training data, without needing to finetune the large pretrained model. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Treat the large pretrained text-to-video model as a probabilistic prior that encodes common video properties like temporal consistency and object permanence.- Learn a separate small video model on the downstream task data to capture the unique styles/distributions of that data.  - Combine the pretrained and small model into a product distribution that retains the prior knowledge while adapting to the new data.- Implement this probabilistically using score composition in diffusion models, without modifying pretrained weights.- Enable sampling from the adapted model using classifier-free guidance for sharper and higher-quality videos.So in summary, the main contribution is an efficient way to leverage a fixed pretrained text-to-video model to guide a small adaptable model for improved video generation on downstream domains, without expensive finetuning. This makes adapting large video models more accessible.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Video Adapter, a method to adapt large pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks by using the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior to guide a small task-specific model, enabling high-quality and efficient video generation without expensive finetuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related work in text-to-video synthesis:- Most prior work has focused on developing large autoregressive or diffusion models for text-to-video generation. This paper proposes a new method, Video Adapter, to adapt a pretrained text-to-video model to new domains/tasks without finetuning the large model.- For controllable generation, existing methods rely on text prompts or finetuning. This paper shows Video Adapter can modify video styles without changing weights of pretrained model, more similar to prompting approaches in language models.- Compared to compositional generative modeling papers, this work specifically composes a large pretrained video model with a small domain-specific model. It is most related to Deng et al. 2020 which combined a language model with a small EBM, but focuses on adapting across domains rather than improving language model consistency.- For efficient video modeling, Video Adapter achieves better metrics than finetuning the pretrained model with the same compute budget. It also outperforms the small task-specific model alone, showing the pretrained model provides a useful prior.- For applications, this paper shows promising results in areas like stylized video generation, robotics sim2real, etc. where adapting large pretrained models is useful but finetuning is expensive.In summary, the key novelty is efficiently adapting large pretrained video models without finetuning, instead using the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior. This is shown to be effective for stylization, video modeling, and sim2real across various experiments.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more efficient and effective ways to adapt pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks. The authors propose Video Adapter as one approach, but mention there is room for improvement such as not requiring any training of a small model.- Exploring different ways to compose and combine pretrained video models with specialized video models, beyond just using the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior. The energy-based view could enable developing more complex compositional generative models.- Applying the video adaptation techniques to broader sets of domains and tasks, such as medical imaging, robot learning, video editing, etc. Evaluating how well the method can generalize.- Developing better quantitative metrics and benchmarks for evaluating domain adapted video models, beyond just standard generative modeling metrics like FVD and IS. - Studying social impacts and potential harms of adapted synthetic video generation models that can produce personalized/specialized video content.- Investigating how pretrained models could be adapted to generate videos conditioned on different modalities like audio, gestures, etc instead of just text.- Combining the idea of adapter-based adaptation withretrieval-based video generation methods.- Exploring ways to further reduce computational requirements and enable access to large foundation video models by more researchers.In summary, the main directions are around improvements to video adaptation techniques, applying adaptation to new domains/tasks, developing better evaluation methods, studying social impacts, and increasing access to large pretrained models. The energy-based view and idea of compositional generative modeling could enable many future research avenues as well.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes Video Adapter, a method to adapt a large pretrained text-to-video model to new domains or tasks without fine-tuning the original model. It works by treating the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior and combining it with a small trainable video model specific to the target domain. By factoring the domain-specific video distribution into the pretrained prior and small adaptable component, the computational cost of adapting the large model can be significantly reduced. Experiments show Video Adapter can generate higher quality and more specialized videos using only 1.25% of the pretrained model's parameters, outperforming the pretrained model alone. It enables controllable video synthesis by adapting animation and sci-fi style models, better video modeling on the Bridge and Ego4D datasets, and realistic robotic video generation. Overall, Video Adapter provides an efficient way to leverage knowledge from a large pretrained text-to-video model for task-specific video generation without expensive finetuning.
