# [Probabilistic Adaptation of Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt large pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks without expensive finetuning. The key hypothesis is that a pretrained text-to-video model captures a powerful prior over natural videos that can guide the generation of task-specific videos when combined with a small trainable model.The authors propose to leverage the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior and compose it with a small task-specific model to generate videos adapted to the downstream domain. This allows adapting the pretrained knowledge without modifying the weights of the large model.
