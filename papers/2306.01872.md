# [Probabilistic Adaptation of Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to adapt large pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks without expensive finetuning. The key hypothesis is that a pretrained text-to-video model captures a powerful prior over natural videos that can guide the generation of task-specific videos when combined with a small trainable model.The authors propose to leverage the pretrained model as a probabilistic prior and compose it with a small task-specific model to generate videos adapted to the downstream domain. This allows adapting the pretrained knowledge without modifying the weights of the large model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Video Adapter for adapting large pretrained text-to-video models to downstream tasks with limited training data, without needing to finetune the large pretrained model. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Treat the large pretrained text-to-video model as a probabilistic prior that encodes common video properties like temporal consistency and object permanence.- Learn a separate small video model on the downstream task data to capture the unique styles/distributions of that data.  - Combine the pretrained and small model into a product distribution that retains the prior knowledge while adapting to the new data.- Implement this probabilistically using score composition in diffusion models, without modifying pretrained weights.- Enable sampling from the adapted model using classifier-free guidance for sharper and higher-quality videos.So in summary, the main contribution is an efficient way to leverage a fixed pretrained text-to-video model to guide a small adaptable model for improved video generation on downstream domains, without expensive finetuning. This makes adapting large video models more accessible.
