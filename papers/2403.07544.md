# [MAMMOTH: Massively Multilingual Modular Open Translation @ Helsinki](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling up monolithic neural networks for multilingual NLP is challenging due to limited model capacity, leading to poor per-language performance (interference). Increasing model size has limits in terms of trainability. 
- Modularity is proposed as a solution but there is a lack of standard frameworks for designing and training modular models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MAMMOTH, an open-source toolkit for training modular encoder-decoder models at scale. 
- It is designed for efficient computation across clusters and covers a wide range of modular architectures from the literature.
- The core concept is a "task" which groups modules, transforms, and a dataset. Tasks are allocated to devices to minimize communication.
- The code builds on OpenNMT-py and contains utilities for distributed training, input processing, models, inference, etc.

Main Contributions:
- First open-source toolkit focused specifically on modularity and scalability in multilingual NLP.
- Allows flexible definition and efficient training of modular architectures.
- Standards and benchmarks for comparing modular approaches. 
- Achieves good scaling on clusters with 100s of GPUs.
- Publicly available to extend and build upon.

In summary, MAMMOTH enables scalable and efficient training of modular multilingual models to address interference, provides flexibility and standards for modeling, and benchmarks demonstrate good scaling behavior across clusters. As an open-source project it aims to advance research in this area.
