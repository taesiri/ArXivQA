# [DeRO: Dead Reckoning Based on Radar Odometry With Accelerometers Aided   for Robot Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- GNSS-denied navigation for robots remains challenging. Visual-inertial solutions like cameras and LiDARs fail in adverse conditions like darkness, fog, lack of features. 
- Radar-inertial odometry (RIO) is a promising solution but has limitations: sensitive to accelerometer biases causing drift; treats radar as auxiliary sensor.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Dead Reckoning based Radar Odometry (DeRO) which uses radar as primary sensor.
- Uses radar velocity and gyro data for dead reckoning to calculate poses. Eliminates need to integrate biased acceleration.
- Radar range data and tilt angles from accelerometers used to update estimation in stochastic cloning-based indirect EKF (SC-IEKF).

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework using radar as both primary and auxiliary sensor. Radar velocity used for dead reckoning, range data for updates.
- Estimate and compensate for radar velocity scale factor errors.
- Fuse data using SC-IEKF to address relative distance from scan matching.  
- Evaluate on real-world open datasets, reduce position error by 47% and rotation error by 52% compared to state-of-the-art.
- Provide open-source implementation in C++ and ROS 2.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel dead reckoning approach using radar velocity as the primary source for odometry. This is more accurate than integrating biased IMU acceleration. The method fuses radar, IMU and accelerometer data using an SC-IEKF to achieve robust and accurate GNSS-denied navigation. Experiments validate the improved performance over state-of-the-art radar-inertial techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dead reckoning framework for robot localization that directly utilizes radar velocity measurements and gyroscope data for pose estimation while using radar range measurements and tilt angles from accelerometers to update the estimates in an indirect extended Kalman filter.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a framework called DeRO (Dead Reckoning based on Radar Odometry) that utilizes radar velocity measurements directly for dead reckoning to calculate poses, while also using radar range measurements (via scan matching) and tilt angles from accelerometers to update the estimation in an indirect extended Kalman filter (IEKF).

2) It estimates and compensates for the 3D radar velocity scale factor to optimize the system's accuracy. 

3) It validates the proposed method through comparative analysis with a state-of-the-art radar-inertial odometry approach using the same open-source datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of DeRO, with average improvements of 47% in position error and 52% in rotation error over the baseline.

4) It provides an open-source C++ ROS 2 implementation to benefit the research community.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel DeRO framework that leverages radar in a hybrid way to achieve improved accuracy by substituting radar velocity for integration of biased accelerometer measurements in dead reckoning. Compensating for radar scale factor and incorporating additional measurements in the IEKF further enhance the performance.

The paper proposes a dead reckoning framework based on radar odometry (DeRO) for robot localization. It fuses data from a 4D FMCW radar and IMU using an indirect EKF with stochastic cloning. The Doppler velocity from radar replaces integration of acceleration for position estimation. Tilt angles from accelerometers are used for measurement updates. Radar scale factor is also estimated and compensated. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets and shows improved accuracy over a state-of-the-art radar-inertial fusion approach.
