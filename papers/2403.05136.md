# [DeRO: Dead Reckoning Based on Radar Odometry With Accelerometers Aided   for Robot Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- GNSS-denied navigation for robots remains challenging. Visual-inertial solutions like cameras and LiDARs fail in adverse conditions like darkness, fog, lack of features. 
- Radar-inertial odometry (RIO) is a promising solution but has limitations: sensitive to accelerometer biases causing drift; treats radar as auxiliary sensor.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Dead Reckoning based Radar Odometry (DeRO) which uses radar as primary sensor.
- Uses radar velocity and gyro data for dead reckoning to calculate poses. Eliminates need to integrate biased acceleration.
- Radar range data and tilt angles from accelerometers used to update estimation in stochastic cloning-based indirect EKF (SC-IEKF).

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework using radar as both primary and auxiliary sensor. Radar velocity used for dead reckoning, range data for updates.
- Estimate and compensate for radar velocity scale factor errors.
- Fuse data using SC-IEKF to address relative distance from scan matching.  
- Evaluate on real-world open datasets, reduce position error by 47% and rotation error by 52% compared to state-of-the-art.
- Provide open-source implementation in C++ and ROS 2.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel dead reckoning approach using radar velocity as the primary source for odometry. This is more accurate than integrating biased IMU acceleration. The method fuses radar, IMU and accelerometer data using an SC-IEKF to achieve robust and accurate GNSS-denied navigation. Experiments validate the improved performance over state-of-the-art radar-inertial techniques.
