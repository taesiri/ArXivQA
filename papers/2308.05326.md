# [OpenProteinSet: Training data for structural biology at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05326)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we create and make publicly available a large-scale dataset of diverse, high-quality multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and associated data to enable open research in protein structure prediction, protein design, and other areas?

The key points are:

- MSAs are very useful for many tasks in structural biology and bioinformatics, but large precomputed datasets have been unavailable. 

- The authors introduce OpenProteinSet, which contains over 16 million MSAs computed for all PDB chains and Uniclust30 clusters.

- OpenProteinSet also provides template hits and AlphaFold2 structure predictions for a filtered, maximally diverse subset.

- They demonstrate the utility of OpenProteinSet by using it to train an open-source AlphaFold2 reproduction called OpenFold.

So in summary, the main research contribution is the creation and public release of this large corpus of MSAs and associated data to enable open research that was previously limited by lack of sufficient training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of OpenProteinSet, a large open-source corpus of over 16 million multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for proteins. The key highlights are:

- It includes MSAs, template hits, and structure files for all 140,000 unique protein chains in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). 

- It contains over 16 million MSAs computed for sequence clusters in the Uniclust30 database.

- A subset of 270,000 diverse, deep Uniclust30 MSAs are provided with associated AlphaFold2 structure predictions.

- The authors demonstrate the utility of OpenProteinSet by using it to train OpenFold, an open-source recreation of AlphaFold2, to similar accuracy as the original model.

- OpenProteinSet represents millions of compute hours and is intended to make large-scale bioinformatics research more accessible by providing precomputed MSAs at the scale used to train AlphaFold2. 

In summary, the main contribution is providing the community with a large, open corpus of protein sequence alignments to enable research in protein structure prediction, design, and modeling that was previously inaccessible outside a few large labs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 This paper introduces OpenProteinSet, a large open-source dataset of over 16 million multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for proteins. The goal is to provide high-quality precomputed MSAs to advance protein-related machine learning research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and protein structure prediction:

- The main contribution of this paper is introducing OpenProteinSet, a large open-source dataset of over 16 million MSAs. This is much larger than previous public MSA datasets like ProteinNet (100k MSAs) or PSP (1 million). It matches the scale of proprietary datasets used to train AlphaFold2 and other recent protein structure prediction models.

- They demonstrate the utility of OpenProteinSet by using it to train OpenFold, an open-source implementation of AlphaFold2. This replicates AlphaFold2's accuracy, which is state-of-the-art for protein structure prediction. Most prior work could not replicate AlphaFold2 due to lack of training data.

- The paper focuses on applications in protein structure prediction, but notes many other uses for MSAs like protein design, function prediction, etc. Other work has explored specific applications like using MSAs for protein language models.

- The MSAs are generated using established tools like HHblits, JackHMMer etc. following AlphaFold2's procedure. Some other work has explored different MSA generation methods like MMseqs2 or genome-based multiple alignments.

- For protein structure prediction, this continues the recent trend of using raw MSAs as input to large neural networks like AlphaFold2. Earlier work focused more on extracting features/statistics from MSAs.

- The scale of the compute resources used here is rare in academic settings. Industry labs like DeepMind arguably still have an advantage in resources to train massive protein models.

In summary, OpenProteinSet pushes forward the open availability of data for protein structure and sequence research. The applications match recent trends, but the public dataset at this scale is a novel contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Continually expanding OpenProteinSet with new sequences as they become available in protein databases. The authors note that known protein sequences are growing rapidly, so the MSAs in OpenProteinSet will become outdated over time without periodic updates.

- Using OpenProteinSet to train new unsupervised protein language models based on raw MSAs, building on prior work like the MSA Transformer. The dataset provides millions of diverse, high-quality MSAs suitable for this purpose.

- Studying "orphan" proteins that lack close homologs, which are common failure cases for existing methods. OpenProteinSet allows focused analysis on such proteins.

- Using OpenProteinSet in multimodal deep learning research, as the protein data could enrich generalist multimodal models trained on diverse data types. The authors suggest OpenProteinSet could be valuable both as a knowledge source and a benchmark dataset in this area.

- Applying OpenProteinSet to additional protein-related tasks beyond structure prediction, such as protein design, function prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, etc. The utility of MSAs is well-established across protein bioinformatics.

- Periodically recomputing MSAs in OpenProteinSet with newer sequence databases as they become available, to keep the dataset current.

In summary, the authors highlight the potential for OpenProteinSet to facilitate future progress in protein language modeling, multimodal learning, orphan protein analysis, and keeping MSA datasets up-to-date as key directions for future work.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces OpenProteinSet, a large open-source database of protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). MSAs summarize evolutionary information by aligning related protein sequences, making them useful for many bioinformatics tasks like protein structure prediction. However, no large-scale MSA datasets exist. OpenProteinSet fills this gap by providing over 16 million MSAs computed for all Protein Data Bank and Uniclust30 sequences. It includes raw MSAs, template hits, and AlphaFold2 structure predictions for 270,000 diverse Uniclust30 sequences. 

The authors demonstrate OpenProteinSet's utility by using it to train OpenFold, an open-source version of AlphaFold2. They are able to accurately reproduce AlphaFold2's performance on the CASP15 benchmark, showing OpenProteinSet's potential to democratize protein-related machine learning. The dataset required millions of compute hours to construct. By releasing it publicly, the authors aim to enable progress on diverse problems in structural biology and multimodal deep learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces OpenProteinSet, a large corpus of precomputed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for proteins. It contains MSAs for all unique chains in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as of April 2022, totaling around 140,000 proteins. It also contains MSAs for 16 million sequence clusters from Uniclust30. From this set, 270,000 maximally diverse clusters were selected and paired with template hits and AlphaFold2 structure predictions. 

The MSAs were computed using HHblits and JackHMMer to search large sequence databases including BFD, UniRef90, Uniclust30, and MGnify. Template hits were identified by searching PDB70 using HHSearch.

To demonstrate the utility of OpenProteinSet, the authors used it to train OpenFold, an open-source implementation of AlphaFold2. They were able to achieve accuracy on par with AlphaFold2, showing that OpenProteinSet can be used as training data for state-of-the-art protein structure prediction.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is the lack of large, high-quality, publicly available datasets of precomputed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for proteins. Specifically:

- Recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction like AlphaFold2 rely on transformer models that attend directly over large quantities of raw MSAs. However, no datasets comparable to what AlphaFold2 was trained on have been released publicly. This hinders progress in protein machine learning.

- While raw sequence data and MSA generation tools are available, actually generating the MSAs is computationally intensive. So most researchers lack access to large MSA datasets.

- Existing public MSA datasets are relatively small and outdated compared to what recent advanced models need. For example, AlphaFold2 was likely trained on hundreds of millions of MSAs.

To address this gap, the paper introduces OpenProteinSet, a large open dataset of over 16 million MSAs suitable for training protein machine learning models at the scale of AlphaFold2 and beyond.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of large, current, publicly available sets of precomputed protein MSAs to fuel recent advances in protein structure prediction and other areas relying on MSAs. The paper aims to provide such a dataset to democratize research in this area.
