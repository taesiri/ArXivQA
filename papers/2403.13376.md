# [Correlation Clustering of Organoid Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Scientists routinely acquire microscopy images of hundreds of morphologically heterogeneous organoids. They need to find patterns and group subsets of similar looking organoids that may represent the same morphological class. Manually clustering a large collection of organoid images is tedious and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes mathematical models and algorithms to automatically correlate and cluster organoid images based on their appearance similarity. Specifically, two approaches are explored:

1) Partial Quadratic Assignment Problem (PQAP): Keypoints are extracted from each image to construct a graph. The PQAP model tries to match the keypoints between pairs of images in a geometrically consistent way, to quantify image similarity.

2) Twin Network: A deep Siamese neural network maps image pairs to a real number, trained to be positive for similar pairs and negative for dissimilar pairs.

The image pairwise similarities are then used in a correlation clustering framework to cluster the collection of images.

Contributions:

- Introduction of a normalization for PQAP that makes solutions comparable across problem instances 

- Application of PQAP and correlation clustering for unbiased organoid image clustering

- Introduction and training of a twin convolutional neural network for quantifying organoid image similarity  

- Creating and releasing organoid image datasets with manual annotations

- Releasing source code to reproduce the image correlation and clustering experiments

The PQAP and twin network approaches are able to cluster organoid images with over 97% and 99% accuracy respectively, compared to manual clustering by biologists. This demonstrates their capability for computer-assisted clustering and analysis of heterogeneous organoid image collections.
