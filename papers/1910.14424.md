# [Multi-Stage Document Ranking with BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14424)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can BERT-based neural ranking models be effectively incorporated into a multi-stage ranking architecture for document retrieval?More specifically, the key research questions examined in this paper include:- How can BERT be adapted for pointwise and pairwise document ranking in the context of a multi-stage architecture? The authors propose monoBERT for pointwise ranking and duoBERT for pairwise ranking.- What is the effectiveness vs. efficiency tradeoff when varying parameters like the number of candidate documents in monoBERT and duoBERT? The authors perform ablation studies to characterize this.- How do monoBERT and duoBERT compare to previous state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets like MS MARCO and TREC CAR? The authors evaluate the techniques on these datasets.- Does additional pretraining of BERT on the target dataset corpus improve effectiveness? The authors find target corpus pretraining helps.- What are the qualitative differences between document rankings produced by different stages? The authors provide some analysis examples.Overall, the central hypothesis is that BERT-based neural ranking models like monoBERT and duoBERT can be effectively incorporated into a multi-stage ranking architecture to improve document retrieval, if properly tuned. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis and characterize the tradeoffs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes two variants of BERT called monoBERT and duoBERT for document ranking. MonoBERT treats document ranking as a binary classification problem over individual candidate documents, while duoBERT adopts a pairwise classification approach.2. It integrates monoBERT and duoBERT into a multi-stage ranking architecture that allows trading off quality against latency by controlling the admission of candidates into each stage. 3. It shows that both monoBERT and duoBERT contribute significantly to the effectiveness of the overall multi-stage ranking system on the MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets. The results are comparable or superior to prior state-of-the-art systems.4. It characterizes the latency-quality tradeoff space enabled by the multi-stage architecture, showing that good operating points can be found that offer a balance between latency and quality.5. It demonstrates that target corpus pre-training improves effectiveness over pre-training on out-of-domain corpora for the document ranking task.Overall, the main contribution is a multi-stage neural ranking architecture using BERT variants that achieves state-of-the-art results on document ranking datasets while allowing flexibility in the latency-quality tradeoff. The integration of monoBERT and duoBERT in a multi-stage pipeline is a novel and effective approach proposed in this paper.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on applying BERT to document ranking:- This paper proposes two novel BERT-based models - monoBERT and duoBERT - for document ranking. Many other papers have applied BERT to ranking, but monoBERT and duoBERT are new contributions.- The paper evaluates the models on two large-scale datasets - MS MARCO and TREC CAR. Using large datasets allows for effectively training and evaluating complex neural models like BERT. Some other papers use smaller proprietary datasets. - The multi-stage ranking architecture integrates monoBERT and duoBERT to balance effectiveness and efficiency. This architecture builds on prior work on multi-stage ranking in IR, connecting it to neural techniques.- The paper thoroughly analyzes the tradeoffs between quality and latency by varying parameters like candidate set sizes. This provides practical insights into model deployment. Some other papers focus only on maximizing quality.- Pre-training BERT on the target corpus is shown to improve results. This demonstrates the value of in-domain pre-training, consistent with other recent findings.- The results on MS MARCO and TREC CAR are state-of-the-art or comparable to the state-of-the-art. The techniques are shown to be highly effective.Overall, the paper makes solid contributions in terms of new BERT models, evaluation, architecture, analysis, and results. The thoroughness in evaluating different models on realistic data is a strength compared to some other more exploratory research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions:- Building the stages of the pipeline jointly, so that hyperparameters are automatically tuned for end-to-end performance. This could increase overall effectiveness by better sharing signals across stages.- Incorporating scoring signals from previous stages explicitly into later stages of the pipeline. This again could help increase end-to-end effectiveness.- Evaluating models that can handle longer documents without truncation, such as Yilmaz et al. (2019), on datasets like the MS MARCO document ranking task. Current BERT-based models are limited to short texts.- Exploring representational learning approaches as an alternative to multi-stage pipelines. However, it's unclear if these can fully replace multi-stage ranking.- Deploying multi-stage ranking architectures to enable practical use of computationally-intensive neural models. The architectures allow controlling the latency-quality tradeoff.In summary, the main future direction is improving multi-stage ranking pipelines, either by enhancing individual stages or composing them more effectively. This provides a practical path to deploying neural models for ranking.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes two BERT-based neural ranking models, monoBERT and duoBERT, for multi-stage document ranking. monoBERT treats ranking as binary classification of document relevance to the query, while duoBERT adopts a pairwise approach comparing document pairs. These models are arranged in a multi-stage pipeline that allows richer models to be applied on successively smaller candidate sets, balancing effectiveness and inference latency. On the MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets, the multi-stage ranking system with both monoBERT and duoBERT achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results. Ablation studies characterize the contribution of each model as well as the latency-quality tradeoff space. Overall, the work shows how complex BERT models can be incorporated into practical multi-stage ranking architectures for improved document ranking effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper explores using BERT, a pre-trained neural language model, for document ranking. The authors propose two variants called monoBERT and duoBERT. monoBERT treats document ranking as a binary classification problem, predicting the relevance of each candidate document independently. duoBERT adopts a pairwise approach, comparing the relevance of pairs of candidates. These models are arranged in a multi-stage ranking pipeline, allowing the benefits of the richer duoBERT model while controlling latency by managing the candidate set size at each stage.  The models are evaluated on the MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets. The results show that both monoBERT and duoBERT provide significant gains over the BM25 baseline. The multi-stage design allows trading off quality and latency by adjusting the candidate set sizes, with duoBERT providing further gains over monoBERT alone. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each model component. The authors achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results to the state-of-the-art on both datasets. They highlight the practicality of complex neural ranking models through multi-stage ranking architectures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes using BERT models in a multi-stage ranking architecture for document retrieval. The first stage retrieves an initial set of documents using BM25 on an inverted index. The second stage re-ranks these documents using a pointwise BERT classifier called monoBERT that predicts the relevance of each document independently. The third stage uses another BERT classifier called duoBERT that looks at pairs of documents from the monoBERT results and predicts which document is more relevant. Different aggregation methods are used to combine the duoBERT pairwise scores into a single score per document. The multi-stage design allows controlling the tradeoff between effectiveness and inference latency, by adjusting the number of candidate documents passed between stages. The paper shows that both monoBERT and duoBERT provide significant gains over just using BM25, and that the full multi-stage system achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets.
