# [Optimal Sample Complexity of Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00379)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of contrastive learning, focusing on the number of labeled samples (triplets/quadruplets) needed to achieve good generalization. The authors establish tight bounds on the sample complexity for learning a variety of distance functions, including $\ell_p$ distances, cosine similarity, tree metrics, and arbitrary metrics. The main results show that for integer $p$, the sample complexity for learning $\ell_p$ distances in $d$ dimensions over $n$ points is $\tilde\Theta(\min(nd, n^2))$, nearly matching the lower bound of $\Omega(\min(nd,n^2))$. This suggests that contrastive learning can be sample efficient when the dimension $d$ is not too large. Additional results characterize how the sample complexity changes with the number of negative examples per anchor, well-separated vs non-separated samples, and extensions to quadruplet learning. The theory is supported by experiments on image datasets, showing the VC dimension predicts practical generalization error well. Overall, the paper helps bridge the gap between statistical learning theory and the practice of contrastive learning, with insightful characterization of the sample complexity.
