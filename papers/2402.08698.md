# [AMEND: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Long-tailed Trajectory   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical task for autonomous vehicles, but suffers from the long-tail problem where models underperform on rare but safety-critical scenarios. 
- Existing methods like contrastive learning are not modular and impose computational burdens. Using multiple experts helps but has inefficient aggregation schemes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes AMEND, a Mixture of Experts framework that trains specialized experts on data partitions and uses a router network to select the best expert per input.

Key Details:
- Data is clustered in the scene encoding latent space to create partitions containing similar scenarios for trajectory prediction. 
- Separate expert models are trained on each partition with loss weights to specialize them. 
- A router network is trained to score experts on input samples using their performance rankings as targets.
- The top-scored expert is selected dynamically to make predictions based on each input.

Main Contributions:
- Specialized mixture of experts achieves state-of-the-art pedestrian trajectory prediction, with significant gains on rare/complex scenarios.
- Modular framework treats base model as a black box, not imposing constraints.
- Efficient inference by only using one expert per input instead of ensemble.
- Ablations verify usefulness of proposed components like router network over baselines.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient and modular mixture of experts approach to improving pedestrian trajectory prediction on long-tail distributions through specialized experts and input-conditional routing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modular trajectory prediction framework called AMEND that trains specialized experts on data partitions and uses a router network to select the best expert for each test sample, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improved accuracy on challenging long-tail scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel mixture of experts framework called AMEND for pedestrian trajectory prediction that addresses the long-tail distribution problem. Specifically:

- They propose a two-stage training scheme where they first train specialized experts on different data clusters, and then train a router network to select the best expert at test time. This allows focusing each expert's resources on a particular data partition.

- They introduce a model-agnostic framework that can work with different trajectory prediction architectures as the backbone network. It is computationally efficient as only one expert is selected at test time.

- They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on standard trajectory prediction benchmarks, with significant improvements on challenging long-tail test samples. 

- They perform extensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of different components of their proposed approach.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating a computationally efficient mixture of experts model that mitigates the long-tail distribution problem in trajectory prediction and outperforms prior arts, especially on complex test cases. The modular nature allows integrating it with various baseline architectures.
