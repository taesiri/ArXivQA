# [Side4Video: Spatial-Temporal Side Network for Memory-Efficient   Image-to-Video Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15769)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Side4Video, an innovative and memory-efficient method to transfer large pre-trained image models to video understanding tasks. Side4Video attaches a lightweight spatial-temporal side network to the frozen pre-trained model, receiving multi-level spatial features from the ViT encoder. This avoids backpropagation through the heavy pre-trained model, significantly reducing memory usage. The side network employs temporal convolutions, spatial self-attention, and feedforward layers to model video representation. Strategies like removing the CLS token, shift self-attention, and GAP pooling further conserve memory while enhancing capabilities. Evaluated on action recognition and text-video retrieval across six datasets, Side4Video delivers state-of-the-art efficiency, using 75% less memory while improving accuracy over prior adapter methods. Notably, Side4Video enables efficiently transferring an extremely large 14.5B parameter ViT-E model to video for the first time, unlocking substantial performance gains. The method demonstrates excellent scalability and data efficiency as well. Code and models are publicly available to facilitate further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Side4Video, a novel spatial-temporal side network attached to frozen image models like CLIP for memory-efficient and scalable fine-tuning on video understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces Side4Video, an innovative and memory-efficient method for fine-tuning pre-trained image models on video tasks. Side4Video attaches a lightweight spatial-temporal side network to the frozen pre-trained model to avoid backpropagation through the large model while still leveraging its features.

2. It demonstrates superior performance over previous efficient fine-tuning methods like adapter-based methods, achieving higher accuracy while using less memory. For example, on Something-Something V2 dataset, it obtains a 75% memory reduction and a 2.2% accuracy increase compared to prior methods.

3. It successfully transfers an extremely large pre-trained image model (ViT-E with 4.4 billion parameters) to video understanding tasks, which is rarely explored before. This shows the capability of Side4Video in scaling up to huge models.

4. It evaluates the approach comprehensively on both unimodal (action recognition) and cross-modal (text-video retrieval) video tasks, delivering state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and scalable approach Side4Video to transfer large pre-trained image models to video domains while using much less memory.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a spatial-temporal side network attached to the frozen pre-trained image model. What is the motivation behind using a side network instead of a posterior network or adapter modules inside the frozen model? What are the advantages of using a side network?

2. The side network utilizes multi-level spatial features from the frozen ViT model. What is the impact of fusing features from different layers? Does fusing low-level features provide any benefit compared to only using high-level features? 

3. The paper explores both temporal convolution and temporal attention for modeling temporal information. What are the trade-offs between convolution and attention in terms of modeling capability, memory usage and ease of training convergence?

4. The method shifts the whole pre-trained CLS token channels back-and-forth across adjacent frames. What is the motivation behind this? How does shifting the CLS tokens help enhance temporal reasoning capability and what is the memory overhead?

5. For the final video representation, the paper compares using the ViT's CLS token, adding an extra CLS token and GAP. What causes the performance difference between these approaches? Why does GAP achieve the best results?

6. How does adjusting the number of layers versus dimensions in the side network impact model capability, memory usage and efficiency? What configuration works best for optimizing performance under constrained resources? 

7. The method is evaluated on both action recognition and text-video retrieval tasks. How are the final video representations adapted differently for these two tasks? What role does the side network play in each task?

8. For text-video retrieval, how does the method leverage the powerful zero-shot capability of the frozen CLIP model while still updating parts of it? Why is this important?

9. The paper demonstrates transferring an extremely large model, ViT-E with 4.4B parameters. What modifications or approximations were required to transfer such a huge model under memory constraints? 

10. The method achieves excellent data efficiency - what properties enable it to perform well even when trained with a fraction of the full dataset? How does data efficiency compare against other methods?
