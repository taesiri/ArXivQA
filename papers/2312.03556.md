# [Personalized Face Inpainting with Diffusion Models by Parallel Visual   Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03556)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Parallel Visual Attention (PVA) to address the task of identity-preserving, language-controllable face inpainting. PVA enhances diffusion models by adding an auxiliary pathway that attends to identity features extracted from reference images. Specifically, PVA introduces parallel attention matrices in the cross-attention modules of the diffusion model's denoising network. These attend to visual features from an identity encoder module, which extracts features using a face recognition network. PVA is trained to reconstruct corrupted images, using both text prompts and reference images as conditional inputs. At test time, PVA achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving identity during inpainting, even when manipulating images based on text prompts. Compared to methods like MyStyle and Custom Diffusion, PVA requires far fewer fine-tuning steps per identity, resulting in over 20Ã— speedup. The method's capabilities are demonstrated on CelebAHQ-IDI, a new dataset introduced in the paper to benchmark identity-preserving face inpainting. Experiments confirm that PVA ensures good identity preservation, language-controllability, and image quality, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.
