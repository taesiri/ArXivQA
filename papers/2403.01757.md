# [How Multimodal Integration Boost the Performance of LLM for   Optimization: Case Study on Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Optimization problems are ubiquitous across domains but developing specialized algorithms for new problems is challenging. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for optimization but struggle to capture variable relationships from only numerical text prompts.  

Proposed Solution:
- Propose using multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to incorporate both text and images for enhanced understanding and optimization performance.
- Develop MLLM optimization framework with 3 main steps:
   1) Extract heuristics from solved problems using text+images
   2) Generate solutions for new problems using learned heuristics 
   3) Iteratively evaluate and refine solutions
- Apply framework to Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to use multimodal inputs (text + images) with LLMs for optimization problems. Provides more comprehensive representation.
- Introduces new XML format for text representation to capture precise variable relationships
- Framework emulates human workflow and can generalize across problems benefiting from visuals
- Experiments on CVRP benchmarks demonstrate clear improvement over LLM with only text input
- Analysis provides insights into why MLLM-V performs better by learning additional visual heuristics

In summary, this paper proposes a novel multimodal LLM optimization framework that leverages both text and images to boost performance. Effectiveness is shown through comprehensive experiments and analysis on the CVRP problem. Key innovation is enabling LLMs to learn from visual representations for enhanced optimization.
