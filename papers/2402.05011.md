## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Navigating Complexity: Toward Lossless Graph Condensation via Expanding Window Matching":

Problem:
- Graph condensation aims to reduce the size of a large graph dataset while preserving the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on it. This helps mitigate the computational cost of training GNNs.
- Existing methods fail to achieve lossless condensation, especially on large graphs, with a significant performance gap between GNNs trained on the original and condensed graphs. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes the supervision signals used to optimize the condensed graph and finds previous methods provide biased signals dominated by "difficult" nodes, overlooking easy nodes with more representative patterns.

- It proposes a new method, Graph Condensation via Expanding Window Matching (GEOM), with three main components:
  1) Uses curriculum learning to train expert GNN trajectories with more diverse supervision signals from the original graph.
  2) Employs expanding window matching to transfer rich information from experts to the condensed graph.
  3) Designs a knowledge extraction module to further uncover information from the trajectories.

- Theoretical analysis shows GEOM's curriculum learning reduces "accumulated error" and expanding window matching allows optimizing more stages of the expert trajectories. This enables effective transfer of information to the condensed graph.

Main Contributions:
- GEOM makes the first attempt at lossless graph condensation, condensing graphs to very low ratios (0.9-5%) without performance drop.
- It achieves state-of-the-art results across datasets and architectures. The condensed graphs also exhibit excellent cross-architecture generalization.
- This can help mitigate the computational cost of training GNNs and facilitates their broader application.

In summary, the paper tackles a key limitation of graph condensation methods using an innovative expanding window matching approach and achieves unprecedented lossless condensation performance.
