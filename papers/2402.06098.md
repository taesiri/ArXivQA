# [Veni, Vidi, Vici: Solving the Myriad of Challenges before Knowledge   Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies four major deficiencies with current knowledge graph (KG) learning systems that limit their performance and ability to empower human use:
1) Lack of integration of expert knowledge about the structure and logic of the KG domain. Most systems treat all parts of a KG as equally relevant.
2) Instability due to extreme variation in node degrees within the KG. Systems struggle to learn accurate embeddings for low-degree nodes.  
3) Inability to focus learning on most relevant triples and model uncertainty. Systems attempt to learn all predictive tasks equally rather than focusing where humans care most.
4) Lack of explainability of model predictions. Black-box nature of systems hinders detecting causes of other deficiencies.

Additionally, attempts to solve each deficiency have largely been in isolation, lacking a holistic view towards advancing KG learning.

Proposed Solution - "Veni, Vidi, Vici" Framework:
The paper proposes a 3-phase framework to reformulate distinct problems in a shared conceptual space and arrive at integrated, holistic solutions:

Veni: Express problems in a common terminology. E.g. view through lens of distinguishing graph elements based on logic, semantics, relevance and topology.
Vidi: Deeply analyze conceptual space to understand why problems were viewed separately historically and what unified view enables. 
Vici: Set specific goals and models to holistically solve core conceptual problem identified, recovering lost opportunities from divide-and-conquer approach.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies four key deficiencies of current KG learning systems and analyze state-of-the-art solutions to each
- Proposes "Veni, Vidi, Vici" framework as methodology to reformulate distinct challenges for integrated solutions 
- Sets out an agenda for shifting KG learning research towards more holistic human-AI co-empowerment
- Suggests framework could strongly benefit many research domains facing multiple intersecting challenges

The paper sets out both an urgent need and structured approach to advance KG learning systems through integrated methods that empower human understanding and analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies four key deficiencies limiting knowledge graph learning systems - lack of expert knowledge integration, instability to topological variation, inability to focus learning, and lack of explainability - and proposes a "Veni, Vidi, Vici" framework to conceptualize and address these interrelated challenges holistically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of the "Veni, Vidi, Vici" framework for conceptualizing and solving multiple challenges in knowledge graph learning systems. Specifically:

- The paper identifies and formalizes four key deficiencies facing current knowledge graph learning systems: lack of expert knowledge integration, instability to topological variation, inability to perform focused learning, and lack of explainability.

- It reviews existing attempts to address each deficiency in isolation, and concludes that the divide-and-conquer approach is limiting progress and human-AI empowerment. 

- The "Veni, Vidi, Vici" framework is proposed as a way to conceptualize diverse problems in a shared space, deeply analyze the connections and losses from separation, and set integrated goals to address the problems holistically.  

- The paper argues this methodology could drive innovation not just in knowledge graph learning but also more broadly in situations with multiple inter-related challenges.

So in summary, the key contribution is the "Veni, Vidi, Vici" framework itself, proposed as a way to make progress on multiple knowledge graph learning challenges simultaneously. The identification and formalization of the key deficiencies is also an important foundation. But the core conceptual contribution is the integrated methodology.

The paper discusses challenges and deficiencies faced by current state-of-the-art knowledge graph learning systems in areas like lack of expert knowledge integration, instability to topological variations in the graph, inability to perform focused learning based on relevance and uncertainty, and lack of explainability. It also proposes a new "Veni, Vidi, Vici" conceptual framework to help address these challenges in a more holistic, integrated manner to enable better human-AI cooperation and empowerment. So the key terms reflect the knowledge graph domains discussed as well as the specific problems and proposed solutions covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the "Veni, Vidi, Vici" method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper states that the Veni phase involves expressing problems in a "shared conceptual space". What does this mean specifically? What would be some examples of how the challenges outlined in the paper could be framed in a shared conceptual space?

2. In the Vidi phase, the paper suggests asking "why did these problems originally separate?" and "how can I see what information was lost in that separation?". Can you elaborate on what potential answers to these questions might be in the context of knowledge graph embedding challenges? What specifically was lost by addressing problems in isolation?  

3. The end goal of the Vici phase is to set concrete, actionable goals to holistically address the overarching problem identified. What might some potential concrete goals be for improving knowledge graph embeddings using the shared perspective gained in the Veni and Vidi phases?

4. The paper states that the 3 phases of Veni, Vidi, Vici are not meant to be linear. Can you expand on what is meant by this? How would the phases interact in an iterative refinement process? Give some examples.  

5. While presented for knowledge graphs, the paper suggests the Veni, Vidi, Vici framework could apply to other domains. What qualities make this framework generalizable? What other specific domains or problem spaces could it be applied to?

6. What are some potential challenges or limitations in trying to implement the Veni, Vidi Vici framework in practice? How might these be mitigated or addressed? 

7. The goal of Veni, Vidi, Vici is to enable more holistic advancement of knowledge graph techniques. In what specific ways might a holistic approach lead to different techniques and innovations compared to the current divide and conquer paradigm?

8. How would you evaluate if Veni, Vidi, Vici is succeeding at enabling more rapid, holistic advancement of knowledge graph techniques? What concrete metrics or evaluations could be used?

9. The framework emphasizes understanding human desiderata. What methods can be used during Veni, Vidi, Vici to properly capture the aspects humans care about most with respect to knowledge graphs and their applications?  

10. The ultimate vision is human-KG co-empowerment. Can you describe more specifically what effective human-KG co-empowerment would look like in practice after applying Veni, Vidi, Vici? What should the human and KG each contribute?
