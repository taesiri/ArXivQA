# [A YANG-aided Unified Strategy for Black Hole Detection for Backbone   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Black holes are a major network security issue where routers silently drop packets without notifying the sender. This disrupts communication and data flow.
- Effective detection of black holes in backbone networks is lacking, as previous research has focused on MANETs which have very different topologies, protocols and requirements.
- Black hole detection in backbone networks is challenging as it requires monitoring a wide variety of metrics across the network.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage specialized YANG data models which provide vendor-agnostic monitoring of network devices. Select 4 models focused on routing protocols and ISP configurations.
- Develop a Black Hole-sensitive Metric Matrix (BHMM) to analyze metrics from YANG models to identify ones most indicative of black holes.
- Use BHMM analysis to improve machine learning-based black hole detection on backbone networks. Evaluate on an ISP network and research network topology.

Key Contributions:
- First use of YANG models for black hole detection in backbone networks. Models adapted specifically for this purpose through BHMM.
- BHMM analysis shown to improve detection accuracy by 10% and packet delivery rate by 13% compared to baseline.
- Approach evaluated on real ISP network and specialized research topology, showing flexibility.
- Fills critical research gap in backbone network security and monitoring. Findings not derived from dissimilar MANET environments.
- Provides system operators actionable insights to detect and mitigate black holes on live networks.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel YANG model and machine learning driven approach to effectively detect black holes in backbone networks. The specialized data analysis outperforms past techniques and offers real-world viability.
