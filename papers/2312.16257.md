# [More than Correlation: Do Large Language Models Learn Causal   Representations of Space?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Recent work showed high correlation between learned representations of large language models (LLMs) like LLaMa and geospatial properties of input text. However, it is unclear if there is a causal relation between the internal spatial representations and model behaviors. This paper investigates whether LLMs learn and use a spatial world model that governs their behaviors.

Methods: 
The authors analyzed the spatial representations learned by DeBERTa-v2 and GPT-Neo on a dataset of city names mapped to latitudes/longitudes using:

- Representational similarity analysis between distance metrics of country representations in LLM activation space and actual geographic space.

- Linear and non-linear probing by training regressors to predict latitude/longitude of cities from LLM activations. A new GeoDist loss is proposed to address limitations of MSE loss.

- Causal intervention experiments where intermediate LLM activations of city names were edited using probe gradients and changes in model prediction were measured for a country classification task and next word prediction.

Key Results:

- RSA and probing analyses showed DeBERTa and GPT-Neo learn spatial representations of city names, with higher layers capturing more geospatial information.

- Intervening on activations to enhance encoded geospatial info improved country classification accuracy, establishing causal influence of spatial representations.

- Similar interventions also causally impacted next word prediction performance that relies on geospatial knowledge.

Main Contributions:

- Provided strong evidence for causal (not just correlative) learned spatial world model in smaller LLMs using targeted activation editing.

- Proposed a novel GeoDist loss for more accurate supervision of latitude/longitude regression probes.

- Showed spatial representations govern model behaviors on geospatial tasks rather than simply reflecting training data statistics.

In summary, this paper clearly establishes a causal spatial world model in LLMs through detailed analysis and intervention experiments, advancing our understanding of these models. The proposed GeoDist loss also helps build more powerful probes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates whether large language models develop causal representations of space by analyzing the spatial information encoded in the hidden states of location words, intervening these representations, and measuring the effect on downstream task performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is establishing a causal link between the spatial representations learned by large language models (LLMs) like DeBERTa-v2 and GPT-Neo and their performance on downstream tasks. 

Specifically, the paper showed through representational similarity analysis and probing that these LLMs learn spatial representations of location words like city names during pretraining. Then through intervention experiments, the authors demonstrated that modifying these learned spatial representations causes changes in the models' performance on tasks like next word prediction and country prediction from city names. For example, aligning the spatial representations more closely with the true geospatial locations improves country prediction accuracy, while misaligning them reduces accuracy.

So in summary, the key contribution is providing evidence that the spatial knowledge encoded in LLMs' internal representations has a causal influence on their behaviors, rather than just being statistical correlations in the training data. This helps advance the understanding of whether LLMs learn meaningful world knowledge or just surface statistics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new loss function called GeoDist for training the probing regressors. How is GeoDist loss different from the commonly used MSE loss? What are the advantages of using GeoDist over MSE for this spatial probing task?

2. The paper shows that non-linear probes consistently outperform linear probes for decoding spatial information from LLM representations. Why do you think non-linear probes work better? What does this suggest about the nature of the learned spatial representations?

3. The paper demonstrates the causal role of spatial representations through targeted perturbation experiments. Can you explain the perturbation methodology in more detail? How does it establish causality compared to simply showing correlation?

4. One interesting finding is that perturbing representations to enhance spatial information leads to smaller improvements compared to deteriorations from perturbing to reduce spatial information. What might explain this asymmetric effect?

5. The paper studies the spatial representations learned by two LLMs - DeBERTa-v2 and GPT-Neo. How do the spatial representations and probing results compare between these two models? What similarities or differences do you notice?

6. How does the choice of prompt impact what spatial information gets encoded into the LLM representations? Did the paper experiment with other prompts? If not, what prompts would you suggest exploring?

7. What are some ways the causal intervention experiments in this paper could be expanded or improved to study the utilization of spatial representations? Can you design additional experiments?

8. The paper analyzes spatial information at the level of city names and countries. Do you think LLMs may learn spatial knowledge at other scales (e.g. neighborhoods, states)? How would you study this?

9. What implications do the findings have for fine-tuning LLMs on geospatial tasks? How could the insights on learned spatial representations be applied?

10. The paper focuses only on spatial representations. Based on the methods, what other aspects of world knowledge learned by LLMs could be studied - e.g. physical properties, social concepts? What experiments would you design?
