## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving safe and coordinated locomotion of multiple legged robots that are interconnected through holonomic constraints. Such cooperative legged robots have potential applications like transporting objects in urban settings. However, ensuring safety during coordinated locomotion is difficult due to the complex, hybrid dynamics of legged systems and the interaction forces induced by the interconnection. The paper aims to develop a control framework that can provide safety guarantees during coordinated locomotion of holonomically-constrained legged robots.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a three-layered control architecture:

1. Top layer: A safety-critical coordination planner using control barrier functions (CBFs) on reduced-order kinematic models to generate safe velocity trajectories. 

2. Middle layer: A model predictive control (MPC) based trajectory optimizer using interconnected single rigid body models to compute optimal ground reaction forces for tracking the safe trajectories from layer 1.

3. Bottom layer: Distributed quadratic programming based controllers for each robot using the full dynamics model and virtual constraints to generate torque inputs that follow the planned trajectories and forces.

The top layer CBF planner provides guarantees on avoiding obstacles and respecting inter-robot constraints. The middle layer MPC optimizes dynamics feasibility. The bottom layer controllers enable precise tracking on real hardware.


Main Contributions:

1. Novel method for safety-critical planning for coordinated legged locomotion using CBFs while respecting holonomic constraints.

2. Layered control architecture bridging coordination planning, feasibility optimization and torque generation that enables safe coordinated locomotion on complexes legged systems.

3. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments on quadruped robots demonstrating effectiveness of proposed approach.

The main novelty lies in enabling provably safe locomotion of interconnected legged systems by combining coordination planning, dynamics optimization and distributed control in a layered framework. Both simulations and quadruped experiments validate the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a multi-layered control approach using control barrier functions to achieve safe and stable cooperative locomotion of quadrupedal robots that are holonomically constrained to maintain a fixed formation, by coordinating high-level trajectory planning with low-level whole-body controllers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a safety-critical approach to the coordinated control of cooperative legged robots that are subject to holonomic constraints. Specifically, the paper:

1) Presents a safety-critical planning framework using control barrier functions (CBFs) that can guarantee safety in coordinating multi-legged robot systems while adhering to holonomic constraints and avoiding obstacles. 

2) Proposes a three-layered control architecture consisting of: (i) a CBF-based top-level safety-critical planner, (ii) a middle-level optimal trajectory planner using model predictive control and interconnected dynamics, and (iii) a distributed low-level controller. This enables efficient tracking of safe trajectories while considering the constraints and dynamics of the interconnected robotic system.

3) Validates the proposed approach through numerical simulations and hardware experiments on a pair of quadrupedal robots that are holonomically constrained. The results demonstrate that the method can achieve safe and coordinated locomotion of multiple legged robots in environments with obstacles.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a method to ensure safety-critical coordination control of cooperative legged robots via CBFs, while maintaining desired formations and avoiding collisions. The layered architecture bridges the gap between high-level planning models and complex robot dynamics to realize this in a robust and efficient manner.
