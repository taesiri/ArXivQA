## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive review and taxonomy of deep learning methods for colorectal polyp segmentation (CPS). 

Problem: 
Accurate segmentation of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images is essential for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, CPS remains challenging due to variations in polyp shape, size, color and lack of clear boundaries. Though deep learning has advanced CPS, there is no systematic review summarizing datasets, metrics, methods and challenges.

Proposed Solution:
The paper categorizes CPS methods using a novel taxonomy along three axes - network architectures, level of supervision and learning paradigms. It reviews 14 datasets and 12 evaluation metrics used for CPS. An extensive benchmarking of 40 state-of-the-art methods on 5 datasets analyzes performance over time. Generalization capability is evaluated on multi-center data. Detailed attribute-based analysis uncovers nuanced strengths and weaknesses of methods.   

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive review of 115 CPS papers from 2014-2023
- In-depth analysis of 14 datasets based on annotations, image resolution, polyp characteristics  
- Benchmarking 40 methods on 5 datasets showing 1.4% annual performance improvement 
- Assessing generalization on multi-center data and attribute-based performance on diverse scenarios
- Identifying key challenges including interpretability, domain shift, and data privacy
- Discussing promising directions like anomaly detection, large vision models, federated learning

In summary, this paper provides a holistic overview of deep learning techniques for the CPS problem and offers insights to advance research in this direction. The analyses on datasets, metrics and method capabilities can serve as an evaluation framework for future approaches.
