# [Machine learning and information theory concepts towards an AI   Mathematician](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current AI systems excel at intuitive abilities like language proficiency but lack deliberate reasoning abilities like mathematical thinking. 
- What ingredients are missing to achieve human-level mathematical reasoning and discovery of new conjectures?
- Can we quantify what makes a mathematical statement interesting or useful to guide research on training AI mathematicians?

Proposed Solution: 
- Draw parallels between compression in statistical learning theory and discovering theorems/proofs that efficiently summarize all provable statements.  
- An interesting conjecture allows proving many other statements concisely. This compression view suggests optimizing the interestingness of mathematical statements.
- Formalize the space of provable statements as an environment for reinforcement learning agents that take proof steps. Judge usefulness of new theorems by how much they compress the space.
- Generate candidate conjectures with high interestingness scores using GFlowNets. Then attempt to prove most promising ones using goal-conditioned policies that can modify subgoals.

Key Contributions:
- Hypothesis that a good set of mathematical theorems compresses the set of all provable statements by making many provable statements easy to prove from them.
- Idea to quantify interestingness of theorems by their ability to compress space of provable statements.
- Proposal to view proof finding as goal-conditioned RL with modifiable subgoals.
- Suggestion to use GFlowNets to generate conjectures scored by interestingness indicators.

The paper connects concepts from information theory, reinforcement learning and theorem proving to outline initial ideas for training AI systems that can discover and prove mathematical conjectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper proposes that an AI system for mathematical discovery should aim to find interesting theorems and proofs that provide a highly compressive summary of the space of all provable statements, and discusses how techniques from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and information theory could contribute to realizing this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an information-theoretic framework for training an AI system to discover new and interesting mathematical conjectures. Specifically:

- It draws an analogy between generalizing in the space of provable mathematical statements and generalizing in the space of physically observable data. Just as a learner trained on observational data can estimate the probability that a new observation is valid, a learner trained on a set of theorems could estimate the probability that a new statement is provable.

- It suggests that a good set of theorems should compress the set of all provable statements - i.e. make it possible to prove many statements with just a small set of core theorems. The "usefulness" of a new theorem depends on how much it improves this compression.

- It relates the process of finding proofs to reinforcement learning, with proof tactics as actions, proven statements as states, and interesting new theorems as goals. Useful theorems are framed as surprising, just as an active learner seeks out highly uncertain examples.

- It proposes using goal-conditioned policies and subgoal generation, as in hierarchical RL, to search for proofs of conjectures. Naming intermediate lemmas is viewed through the lens of compression.

So in summary, the paper lays out a vision for training an AI mathematician based on principles of compression and information theory, with connections drawn to active learning, reinforcement learning, and hierarchical planning. The framework provides ways to quantitatively assess conjectures and guides the search for their proofs.

It relates this to concepts of compression, generalization, active learning, and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Key aspects include formulating an objective function based on compressing the set of all provable statements, generating candidate conjectures, and then trying to prove them using proof tactics, lemmas as subgoals, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper for developing an AI mathematician:

1. The paper proposes that a useful mathematical theorem is one that compresses the set of all provable statements. What practical approaches could be used to approximate or estimate this compression ratio, given that the set of all provable statements is intractably large?

2. The paper draws an analogy between generalizing in the space of provable mathematical statements and generalizing in the space of physically observable data. What are some key differences between these two spaces that an AI mathematician would need to account for? 

3. The paper defines the state of a conjecture-making agent as a directed acyclic graph encoding known theorems and their proofs. What are some challenges or open questions around using reinforcement learning with such a structured, graph-based state representation?

4. When defining what makes a useful theorem, the paper discusses both intrinsic mathematical interest and applied usefulness. How might an AI mathematician balance or combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards when judging the interestingness of theorems?

5. Active learning is proposed as a way to select useful new training data for an AI mathematician. What types of queries or interventions could an active learning approach use to uncover mathematically interesting theorems?

6. The paper suggests surprising theorems may be useful to prove. How can we quantify or estimate the surprise value of a conjecture within a mathematical theory? What role could curiosity play?

7. Goal-conditioned policies are proposed for proving conjectures by generating lemma subgoals. What mechanisms could trigger reformulation of the end goal itself during the proof search?

8. The paper discusses how new symbol definitions compress downstream proofs. How might an AI mathematician determine which intermediate symbols merit being named and reused versus used only locally?

9. How could curriculum learning be used to improve an AI mathematician over time as its knowledge advances from simpler to more sophisticated mathematical concepts?

10. The paper leaves open how to quantify the interestingness of a theorem outside its role within a proof. What other intrinsic measures of beauty or elegance might guide an AI mathematician?
