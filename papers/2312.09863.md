# [Proprioceptive State Estimation for Amphibious Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tactile sensing is critical for robots to interact with objects, but integrating effective tactile sensors into soft robotic systems is challenging. This is especially true for robotic fingers that operate in confined spaces and harsh environments like underwater.

- Existing rigid tactile sensors struggle to conform to soft fingers' changing morphology. Vision-based tactile sensing shows promise but has not been well explored for compliant soft finger designs.  

- Proprioceptive state estimation of soft fingers' deformation during grasping is difficult but can provide valuable tactile information about object shape and properties. This capability is lacking but needed for versatile robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured and amphibious environments.

Solution:
- The paper presents a novel vision-based approach for proprioceptive shape sensing of a soft robotic finger. It leverages the finger's metamaterial structure and omni-directional adaptability along with an embedded camera to capture deformation.

- A computational model discretizes the finger into tetrahedral elements. By optimizing rigidity-aware constraints from visual observations, efficient and accurate estimates of the finger's dynamic shape changes are obtained.  

- The method is extended to contact-based object shape sensing by extracting interface points between the finger and object during grasping. Implicit surface reconstruction techniques estimate the local object geometry.

Contributions:
- Proposes and validates a model-based proprioceptive state estimation method for a soft robotic finger using in-finger vision, achieving a median error of 1.96mm in deformation sensing.

- Formalizes a pipeline for contact-based object surface estimation by leveraging the finger's adaptation to infer shape from discrete interface points and Gaussian process implicit surfaces.

- Evaluates system performance for object shape sensing in both dry and underwater environments, demonstrating capabilities for amphibious tactile robotic applications.

Overall, the paper presents an effective vision-based proprioceptive sensing technique for soft robotic fingers, with useful applications in dexterous grasping and tactile exploration of objects, especially in unstructured and aquatic settings. The method combines passive adaptation with sensory-driven state estimation to enable improved environmental perception for soft robots.
