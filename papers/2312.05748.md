# [IL-NeRF: Incremental Learning for Neural Radiance Fields with Camera   Pose Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Neural radiance fields (NeRF) is a promising approach for generating photorealistic 3D reconstructions from images. However, NeRF requires access to all training images at once to accurately estimate camera poses and train the model. This is impractical for scenarios where data arrives sequentially over time. Existing incremental learning methods for NeRF rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses for each incoming chunk of data. However, this poses a paradox as the camera poses can only be accurately estimated using the full dataset which is unavailable. 

Proposed Solution (IL-NeRF):
The authors propose a framework called IL-NeRF that enables incremental training of NeRF models without access to pre-estimated camera poses. The key ideas are:

1) Select a subset of past camera poses using a reward-collection optimization to ensure quality and coverage. Render images using past NeRF model.  

2) Estimate current camera poses by combining incoming images and rendered images. Computes transfer matrices to align current poses to past coordinate system.

3) Jointly optimize current poses and train NeRF model using both current images and distilled past rendered images to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Main Contributions:

- Novel coordinate alignment method to transform estimated camera poses of new data into consistent system without ground truth poses. Formulated as graphical optimization problem.

- Integrated pipeline enabling incremental NeRF training with unseen images and without pre-estimated poses. Achieves comparable quality to batch method.

- Extensive experiments validate IL-NeRF mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Outperforms baselines by 10-50% in PSNR/SSIM, and aligns camera poses effectively.

In summary, the paper tackles a practical incremental learning scenario for NeRF and proposes an integrated solution (IL-NeRF) that jointly estimates, aligns, and refines camera poses while training the neural radiance field in a sequential manner.
