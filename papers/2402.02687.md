# [Poisson Process for Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian Optimization (BO) is used for sample-efficient black-box optimization, relying on a surrogate model to estimate the response surface of the black-box function. 
- Most prior BO methods attempt to build an absolute response surface based on observed function values. However, absolute metrics can be difficult to obtain, sensitive to noise, and lack transferability.  
- Relative metrics like rankings can address these issues but few BO methods have explored building a ranking-based response surface.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel BO framework called Poisson Process Bayesian Optimization (PoPBO) which directly captures the global ranking of candidates over the search space. 
- Model the ranking via a Poisson process, where the ranking of a candidate can be figured out by counting better candidates. This is naturally suitable for modeling discrete counts like rankings.
- Derive tailored acquisition functions called Rectified Lower Confidence Bound (R-LCB) and Expected Ranking Improvement (ERI) to suggest the next query while balancing exploitation-exploration trade-off.

Main Contributions:
- First BO method to directly capture a global ranking-based response surface using Poisson process, which is more robust to noise.
- Tailored ranking-based acquisition functions for the proposed response surface.
- Computationally efficient framework with complexity O(N^2) compared to O(N^3) for Gaussian Process BO.  
- Strong empirical performance over baselines on simulated and real-world benchmarks, including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel and efficient Bayesian Optimization framework to build a ranking-based response surface using Poisson process. This is demonstrated to be more robust, practical, and transferable compared to traditional value-based BO methods.
