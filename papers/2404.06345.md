# [AgentsCoDriver: Large Language Model Empowered Collaborative Driving   with Lifelong Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Current autonomous driving systems face limitations in interpretability, generalization, and continuous learning capabilities. They also lack collaboration between vehicles, which is important for safety and efficiency. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes AgentsCoDriver, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enable multi-vehicle collaborative driving with lifelong learning. The key components are:

1) Observation module: Encodes surrounding scenario into structured text descriptions to feed to downstream modules.

2) Reasoning engine: Based on an LLM, it reasons over observations, memories, goals and messages to make driving decisions. Uses chain-of-thought prompting for interpretability.  

3) Memory module: Stores and recalls commonsense, experience and reflection memories to improve reasoning.

4) Reinforcement reflection module: Evaluator scores decisions and reflector provides detailed verbal analysis to drive continuous improvement.  

5) Communication module: Enables vehicles to exchange information and negotiate actions through learned communication policies.

Together, these modules facilitate collaborative decision-making, knowledge accumulation and lifelong learning in complex traffic environments. 

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes the first LLM-powered framework, AgentsCoDriver, for multi-vehicle collaborative driving with lifelong learning abilities.
2) Modules for reasoning, reflection and communication enable interpretability, safety and efficiency.
3) Experiments demonstrate capabilities for collaboration, negotiation and continuous improvement between vehicles.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions in leveraging LLMs for advanced collaborative autonomous driving systems that can learn and cooperate throughout their lifetimes. The proposed AgentsCoDriver framework significantly pushes forward the state-of-the-art.
