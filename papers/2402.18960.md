# [Towards Out-of-Distribution Detection for breast cancer classification   in Point-of-Care Ultrasound Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for medical image analysis show promise, but reliability and safety are critical concerns. Models must be able to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples that they cannot reliably classify.
- Prior work showed promise of using deep learning to classify breast cancer in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images. This paper aims to extend that work by evaluating methods to detect OOD samples.

Methods:
- Three OOD detection methods evaluated: softmax scores, energy scores, and deep ensembles. Compared on three OOD test sets: MNIST, CorruptPOCUS, and ultrasound images of carotid artery (CCA).
- Classification network is a CNN with 5 conv layers and 2 dense layers. 
- Energy score method uses multiple exits in the CNN to calculate energy scores. Ensemble method uses 20 CNNs independently trained.

Results: 
- Softmax performs poorly in detecting OOD samples.  
- Energy score works well on MNIST and CorruptPOCUS but not CCA. 
- Ensemble method most robust - strong OOD detection across all test sets.
- Weighting uncertainties in ensemble improves OOD detection. 
- All methods still struggle detecting OOD samples highly similar to training data.

Conclusion:
- Ensemble method shows most promise for detecting OOD samples, but with higher complexity.
- Methods show ability to detect corrupted/poor quality ultrasound images.
- Future work still needed to detect OOD samples close to training distribution.

Main Contributions:
- First evaluation of OOD detection methods for breast cancer classification in POCUS
- Demonstrated ensemble methods can reliably detect OOD samples
- Showed limitations in detecting OOD samples highly similar to training data
