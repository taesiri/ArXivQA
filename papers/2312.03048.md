# [DGInStyle: Domain-Generalizable Semantic Segmentation with Image   Diffusion Models and Stylized Semantic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03048)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic datasets struggle to generalize to real-world target domains due to the domain gap. Domain generalization techniques aim to improve model robustness to unseen domains by only using labeled source domains during training. This paper investigates whether a powerful generative model can produce diverse labeled data to improve domain generalization for semantic segmentation.

Method: 
The authors propose DGInStyle, a data generation pipeline based on a latent diffusion model (LDM) finetuned on source domain data and conditioned on source domain labels. To specialize the LDM to controlled image generation, they introduce:

1) Style Swap: Finetune the LDM on the source domain, then train a conditional model on top. By swapping back to the original LDM at inference time, semantic control is retained while style diversity from the prior is restored. 

2) Multi-Resolution Latent Fusion (MRLF): A two-pass scheme that first generates a low-resolution image, then refines details and small objects at higher resolution while preserving quality of large objects via latent inpainting diffusion.

3) Style prompting: Text prompts with random weather qualifiers are provided along with label conditions to increase output diversity. 

Using DGInStyle, the authors generate a diverse labeled dataset for training semantic segmentation networks. The data improves performance of state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques by +2.5 mIoU on autonomous driving benchmarks.

Contributions:
1) A specialized fine-tuning scheme for LDMs that retains prior style diversity while gaining precise semantic control.

2) A multi-resolution generation technique to enhance quality of small objects in LDM outputs.

3) New state-of-the-art for domain generalization on multiple segmentation benchmarks, enabled by data generation with strong generative priors.
