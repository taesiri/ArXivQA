# [Less is More: Reducing Task and Model Complexity for 3D Point Cloud   Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11203)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is: How can we develop an efficient semi-supervised 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation method that achieves higher performance with less training data, lower computational cost, and smaller model size compared to existing approaches?The key hypothesis appears to be:By combining 1) a smaller model architecture via a novel Sparse Depthwise Separable Convolution module, 2) a new active frame sampling strategy to maximize training data diversity, and 3) a soft pseudo-labeling method leveraging LiDAR reflectivity, it is possible to develop a semi-supervised 3D segmentation approach that achieves superior performance while reducing model complexity, training data needs, and computational costs compared to current state-of-the-art methods.In essence, the paper hypothesizes that "less is more" - less model complexity, less training data, and less computation can lead to more segmentation accuracy when the right techniques are used, contradicting the common intuition that bigger models and more data are always better. The experiments aim to validate this central hypothesis.
