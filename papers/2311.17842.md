## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a new approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps directly from visual observations and high-level language instructions. ViLa integrates perceptual information into the reasoning process, enabling an understanding of commonsense knowledge grounded in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes. This allows ViLa to excel at complex tasks involving cluttered environments and nuanced goal specifications. Additionally, ViLa supports flexible multimodal goal descriptions using images, language, or both, and it naturally incorporates real-time visual feedback for closed-loop planning. Through extensive experiments in real-world and simulated settings, ViLa consistently outperforms prior methods that use language models with separate visual affordance models across a diverse range of manipulation tasks. The results highlight ViLa's capabilities for general-purpose robotic planning requiring contextual understanding and adaptation. Limitations are dependence on black-box VLMs and output consistency, while future work may explore personalized fine-tuning and prompting strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ViLa, a novel robotic planning method that leverages vision-language models to directly incorporate visual observations into the reasoning process for generating step-by-step plans, enabling an understanding of commonsense knowledge grounded in the physical world and supporting flexible multimodal goal specification and visual feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Robotic Vision-Language Planning (\model), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps directly from visual observations and high-level language instructions. 

Key properties and advantages of \model highlighted in the paper include:

- It can understand commonsense knowledge grounded in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes, enabling it to handle complex tasks demands. This is superior to previous LLM-based planners.

- It supports flexible multimodal goal specification, being able to utilize goal images, language instructions, or a combination of both.

- It can effectively utilize visual feedback for closed-loop planning in dynamic environments.

The paper presents extensive experiments in both real-world and simulated environments that demonstrate \model's effectiveness across a diverse range of manipulation tasks compared to prior methods. The results provide evidence that \model has potential as a universal task planner for general-purpose robotic systems.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a novel robotic planning approach based on VLMs that overcomes limitations of prior LLM-based planners by seamlessly integrating vision and language reasoning.
