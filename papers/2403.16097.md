# [Can Language Models Pretend Solvers? Logic Code Simulation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Logic is fundamental for software engineering tasks like verification and testing. However, there are gaps between natural language and solver languages that make applying logic solvers challenging. 
- Existing research has focused on using LLMs as natural language reasoners or translators, but their ability as logic code interpreters/executors is underexplored. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the novel concept of "logic code simulation", where LLMs are tasked with predicting the execution outcomes of logic code. 
- To facilitate this, 3 new datasets are introduced for evaluating LLMs on different logical theories and complexities.
- A new prompting technique called "Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL)" is proposed that guides the LLM to reason via 2 separate paths - assuming SAT and UNSAT - before deciding on the more compelling one.

Main Contributions:
- First work proposing and evaluating LLMs for directly simulating outputs of logic code, without needing translation.
- Introduction and evaluation of DCoL prompting technique that improves accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo by 7.06% on logic code simulation.  
- Extensive experiments evaluating simulation capability of different LLMs, and identifying strengths like handling errors and limitations like complex constraints.
- Three new datasets released for advancing research in this novel area of logic code simulation.

In summary, this paper opens up a new paradigm of utilizing LLMs as logic solvers by directly having them simulate execution of logic code through model inference. Both capabilities and limitations are systematically evaluated, and DCoL is introduced as an effective prompting technique.
