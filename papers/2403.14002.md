# [Uncertainty Driven Active Learning for Image Segmentation in Underwater   Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computer vision models like those used for autonomous driving and underwater infrastructure inspection require large labeled datasets which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. 
- Active learning aims to reduce the labeling effort by selecting the most informative samples to train models that perform similarly to models trained on the full dataset.

Method:
- The authors propose an active learning framework that uses Monte Carlo dropout during inference to estimate the epistemic uncertainty of predictions. 
- Mutual information is used as the acquisition function to select images with high uncertainty for labeling and retraining the model iteratively.
- Two segmentation models - DenseNet and HyperSeg are evaluated on the CamVid street scene dataset and a real-world underwater pipeline inspection dataset with over 50,000 images.

Main Contributions:
- First study of active learning on real underwater images showing a 6.2% performance gain over random sampling on the pipeline dataset. 
- Using a threshold for uncertainty to select images instead of a fixed percentage in each iteration.
- Evaluation on CamVid shows DenseNet achieves 97.9% of full supervision performance using 41.9% of the data. HyperSeg achieves 87.1% performance using only 28.8% of the data.
- On the pipeline dataset, HyperSeg with active learning reaches 67.5% mIoU using 12.5% of data compared to 61.4% with random sampling.
- Implementations are released to reproduce CamVid experiments with both models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that active learning with a simple MC-dropout approach effectively reduces labeling costs for computer vision datasets, especially for underwater image segmentation. The method is validated extensively on real underwater data as well as on a public street scene dataset.
