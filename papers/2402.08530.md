# [A Distributional Analogue to the Successor Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08530)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Standard distributional RL methods require access to rewards during training in order to predict return distributions. This prevents zero-shot evaluation on new tasks with novel rewards.
- The successor representation (SR) allows zero-shot expected return evaluation by separating transition structure from rewards, but does not extend to full return distributions. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the distributional successor measure (DSM) which captures uncertainty over state occupancies and acts as an operator mapping rewards to return distributions.
- Represent the DSM via delta-models, ensembles of diverse generative models representing atoms of the DSM.
- Train delta-models to match n-step distributional Bellman targets using a novel MMD loss over model distributions, enabling longer-horizon learning. Employ techniques like adaptive adversarial kernels for added stability.

Contributions:
- Formalize the DSM as a distribution over discounted state occupancy distributions. Show it generalizes SR and enables zero-shot distributional policy evaluation.
- Develop tractable delta-model approximations to the DSM which can be trained scalably using the proposed techniques.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot prediction of return distributions on various tasks. Uniquely enable risk-sensitive policy selection without any further training.

In summary, the paper introduces the distributional successor measure to enable zero-shot evaluation of full return distributions. It provides a complete framework, including delta-model representation, training methodology, and applications showing unique capabilities like risk-sensitive policy ranking with zero additional training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces the distributional successor measure, a distribution over future state occupancy distributions that enables zero-shot distributional policy evaluation, allowing evaluation on novel rewards without further learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces the distributional successor measure (DSM), which describes the distribution over future state occupancies in a Markov decision process. The key contributions are:

1) Defining the DSM as a distribution over distributions, and showing how it can be used with any reward function to obtain the corresponding distribution of returns. This enables zero-shot distributional policy evaluation on new tasks.

2) Proposing the δ-model, a tractable approximation to the DSM using an ensemble of diverse generative models. Several algorithmic techniques are introduced that are crucial for learning good δ-models from data.

3) Demonstrating the usefulness of δ-models for zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation. The δ-models can predict entire return distributions for new tasks and accurately rank policies according to various risk criteria without any further learning. This is not possible with any other existing methods.

Overall, the paper introduces a novel perspective on distributional RL that separates transition dynamics from rewards. This enables powerful capabilities like zero-shot distributional policy evaluation and risk-sensitive policy selection across tasks. The δ-model is proposed as a practical algorithm for learning approximations of the DSM from data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Distributional successor measure (DSM): A distribution over distributions that captures the aleatoric uncertainty in state occupancies over long horizons. Enables zero-shot distributional policy evaluation.

- $\delta$-model: A tractable parametric approximation to the DSM using an ensemble of diverse generative models. 

- Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD): A metric used to compare probability distributions, which is used to define losses for training $\delta$-models.

- Distributional Bellman equation: A Bellman equation for the DSM that allows it to be computed via dynamic programming.

- Zero-shot distributional policy evaluation: The ability to evaluate a policy's return distribution on new tasks/rewards without further learning, enabled by the DSM.

- Risk-sensitive policy selection: Ranking policies by risk metrics like CVaR computed from predicted return distributions. The DSM enables this in a zero-shot manner.

- Random occupancy measure: A distributional perspective on successor representations that underlies the definition of the DSM.

- $n$-step bootstrapping: A technique to improve learning of long-horizon generative models like $\delta$-models.

- Adaptive kernels: Learning embeddings to define adaptive kernels improves metrics like MMD when comparing non-stationary model distributions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The distributional successor measure (DSM) is defined as a distribution over occupancy measure distributions. What is the intuition behind modeling it this way rather than just learning a single occupancy measure distribution? What kinds of additional information does the DSM capture compared to a standard successor measure?

2. The DSM allows for zero-shot distributional policy evaluation on new reward functions. Explain the process for how this is done. What can the full predicted return distribution be used for that a single expected return value cannot?

3. The authors propose representing the DSM via an equally-weighted particle model called a δ-model. Walk through the details of how the loss function for training a δ-model is constructed using a two-level maximum mean discrepancy. Why is it necessary to use kernels and MMD losses defined over both the state space and the space of distributions?  

4. Explain the issue of non-stationarity when training δ-models and how the use of an adversarial kernel addresses this. Why can't a fixed, non-adaptive kernel be used throughout training instead?

5. The n-step bootstrapping technique is critical for stable training of δ-models. Explain why single-step bootstrapping targets have low signal-to-noise ratio and how increasing n mitigates this issue. What practical considerations need to be made in selecting n?

6. Under the framework presented, what structural information needs to be provided or assumed about the environment in order to predict a DSM? For example, can partial observability be handled? What about on-policy distributional shifts?

7. Proposition 1 shows the DSM acts as a linear operator that maps reward functions to return distributions. Walk through the proof of why this result requires deterministic state-conditioned rewards. Can you think of an example with stochastic rewards where this linearity breaks down?  

8. The DSM encodes the inherent stochasticity of both the environment dynamics and the policy. Compare and contrast this with prior work on successor features and measures that aim to capture model uncertainty. What unique information does the DSM provide?

9. The experiments focus on policy evaluation transfers to new tasks. Can you think of other ways the predicted DSM could be used? For example, could it be applied to risk-sensitive policy optimization or exploration?

10. The DSM enables predicting return distributions without requiring rollouts from a learned model. This avoids issues with model error accumulation. Provide some hypothetical examples of how such model errors could arise in practice and describe the effects they might have on rollout-based policy evaluation.
