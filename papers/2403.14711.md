# [Human-in-the-Loop AI for Cheating Ring Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Online exams are popular for accessibility but raise concerns about cheating through "cheating rings" - groups using professional services to help people cheat. This threatens validity of scores.

Proposed Solution:  
- A human-in-the-loop AI system to detect potential cheating rings by analyzing patterns in test takers' mouse movements and keystrokes to identify likely impersonation across test sessions.

- Two main components:
  1) Keystroke/mouse pattern analysis to flag suspicious matches
  2) Interface showing flagged historical matches to human proctors for further investigation 

- Designed adhering to Responsible AI standards.

Contributions:
- Outlines design of cheating ring detection system integrating human proctors and AI for high-stakes online exams.
- Delves into operational logic and human-AI interaction.
- Discusses evaluation of system performance using real test session data. Achieves AUROC of 98.74% and low false negative rate.
- Presents fairness analysis across demographic groups using equality of opportunity metric.  
- Highlights limitations and future work around expanding fairness metrics and investigating human proctor decisions.
- Emphasizes ethical considerations and responsible AI standards in deployment.

In summary, the paper introduces an AI-assisted system to detect potential cheating rings for online exams while upholding accountability, outlining its logic, evaluation, and alignment to responsible AI principles.
