# [HAROOD: Human Activity Classification and Out-of-Distribution Detection   with Short-Range FMCW Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08894)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes HAROOD, a novel deep learning framework for concurrent human activity classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using 60 GHz FMCW radar data. HAROOD has a two-stage architecture, with the first stage trained using a novel loss function incorporating intermediate reconstruction loss for OOD detection, intermediate contrastive loss for outlier exposure to improve OOD detection, and triplet loss for better classification. This stage extracts discriminative embeddings passed to the second lightweight classification stage. Experiments on a dataset of human activities (sitting, standing, walking) and various household objects demonstrate HAROOD's accuracy, achieving 96.51% on activity classification and 95.04% AUROC on OOD detection. Comparisons also show superiority over state-of-the-art methods on OOD detection metrics. Key innovations include the architecture, training procedure, and losses tailored for joint in-distribution classification and OOD detection with radar data.
