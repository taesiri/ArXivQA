# [CLIPPER+: A Fast Maximal Clique Algorithm for Robust Global Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15464)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Data association is a key component in many robotics and computer vision applications like point cloud registration, SLAM, etc. It involves establishing correspondences between data elements across different sets. A major challenge is handling noise and outliers which lead to wrong data associations and failures in applications. Specifically in point cloud registration, outlier ratios can be extreme (99%+) causing traditional techniques like RANSAC and gradual non-convexity to fail.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents CLIPPER+, an algorithm to find the maximum clique in a consistency graph. The consistency graph formulation makes the approach robust to outliers. Vertices represent putative data associations and edges denote their consistency. The maximum clique corresponds to the maximum set of consistent inlier associations. 

Since finding the maximum clique is NP-Hard, CLIPPER+ uses two approximations - a greedy algorithm ordered by vertex core numbers, and an optimization algorithm based on a novel continuous relaxation. It combines these techniques by first pruning the graph based on the greedy solution, then running optimization on the smaller graph.

Main Contributions:

1) Improved continuous relaxation optimization for higher accuracy over prior CLIPPER algorithm 

2) CLIPPER+ algorithm combining greedy and optimization approaches for better runtime and accuracy

3) Evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrating CLIPPER+ has highest accuracy in estimating maximum cliques

4) Evaluations on real point cloud datasets showing CLIPPER+ enables correct registration with over 99% outlier ratios

In summary, CLIPPER+ enables robust data association in regimes with extreme outliers by effectively estimating maximum cliques in consistency graphs. Its high accuracy and low runtime make the technique suitable for real-time applications needing resilience to outliers like point cloud registration, SLAM, etc.
