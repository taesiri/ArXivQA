# [The Cost of Down-Scaling Language Models: Fact Recall Deteriorates   before In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04680)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the central research question is: 

How does scaling the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) affect their core capabilities related to recalling facts seen during pre-training versus processing information presented in-context during inference?

The authors evaluate the effects of scaling LLMs (both up and down) via two techniques - pruning and dense scaling - on the model's abilities for fact recall and in-context learning. Their key findings are:

- Pruning more than 30% of weights significantly degrades the ability to recall facts seen during pre-training. However, in-context learning is preserved even with 60-70% pruning.

- Similarly, dense scaling down by reducing model width/depth degrades fact recall ability while largely preserving in-context learning. 

So the core question is understanding the disparate effects of scaling on fact recall versus in-context learning abilities in LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) Curating a set of benchmarks to assess the effects of scaling large language models on their abilities for fact recall vs in-context learning. The benchmarks involve question answering datasets as well as parameterized function learning tasks.

2) Evaluating two scaling approaches (pruning and dense scaling) on an extensive set of 6 LLMs using the curated benchmarks. The key findings are:

- Pruning more than 30\% of weights significantly hurts fact recall abilities but in-context learning is preserved even after 60-70% pruning. 

- Dense scaling shows a similar disparity, with fact recall degrading readily while in-context learning is more robust.

3) The findings reveal scaling has an inherently different effect on fact recall versus in-context learning. This highlights the need to look beyond just aggregate metrics when evaluating scaling approaches and motivates further research directions like using pruning for interpretability and combining scaling with memory augmentation.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be using carefully designed benchmarks to reveal the disparate effects of scaling approaches on the core abilities of fact recall and in-context learning in large language models. The insights from this analysis point to important future research directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- Scope of analysis: This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the effects of model scaling specifically on two core capabilities - fact recall and in-context learning. Much prior work has studied scaling laws and measured aggregate task performance. The focus on disentangling capabilities is novel.

- Task curation: The paper carefully curates a set of tasks to evaluate the fact recall and ICL abilities in isolation. Using overriding QA and parameterized ICL tasks is an innovative way to rigorously separate the two abilities. 

- Scaling techniques: The paper considers both pruning and dense scaling approaches to changing model size. Evaluating both provides insight into effects intrinsic to scaling rather than artifacts of a specific technique. 

- Key finding: A key finding is the disparity between how fact recall and ICL are affected by scaling. The paper shows both pruning and dense scaling impact fact recall much more readily. This core result reveals important nuances missed in typical evaluations.

- Implications: Based on the findings, the paper suggests promising research directions like using memory augmentation to offset degraded fact recall in smaller models. The disparate effects also motivate studying representations captured in the small set of weights that support ICL.

Overall, the in-depth focus on capabilities, careful task curation, and novel findings differentiate this work from typical research that measures aggregate performance to study scaling. The analysis provides unique insight into the subtler effects of scaling LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing theoretical explanations for why scaling model size affects fact recall and in-context learning abilities differently. The authors propose some hypotheses but call for more rigorous theoretical verification.

- Using pruning as a tool to improve interpretability and isolate parts of the network responsible for different capabilities like in-context learning. The authors suggest the small set of weights needed for ICL could help localization efforts.

- Exploring memory augmentation techniques that allow smaller models to focus on in-context processing while delegating fact retrieval to separate modules. This could improve the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff.

- Studying the effects of scaling on other important capabilities like generalization, reasoning, common sense, etc. The authors focus on fact recall and ICL but suggest examining other abilities too.

- Testing whether similar disparate effects occur with other model families, scaling techniques, and levels of scaling. The authors demonstrate the effects with pruning/dense scaling and certain sized models but suggest expanding the investigation.

- Developing prompt design techniques to better isolate the in-weight vs in-context abilities. The authors acknowledge the challenges in fully disentangling these.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around developing theory, using pruning for interpretability, augmenting with external memory, studying other capabilities, testing other setups, and improving prompting techniques. The authors lay out several interesting directions to better understand model scaling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper investigates the effects of scaling down large language models on two core capabilities - recalling facts seen during pre-training and processing new information presented in context - finding that fact recall deteriorates more readily than in-context learning when model size is reduced.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the effects of scaling the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) on two core capabilities that underpin their practical success: the ability to recall facts seen during pre-training and the ability to perform in-context learning (ICL). The authors evaluate the impact of scaling via two techniques - pruning and dense scaling - on these capabilities using a suite of tasks. For fact recall, they use closed-book QA datasets where answering questions relies on recalling facts from pre-training. For ICL, they use a gradation of tasks requiring increasingly sophisticated context processing, from open-book QA where answers are directly present in the context, to learning parameterized functions from input-output examples in the context. They find a striking difference in how scaling affects the two capabilities. Reducing model size by over 30% via either pruning or dense scaling significantly decreases fact recall ability. However, ICL abilities are remarkably robust, withstanding pruning of 60-70% of weights. The disparity likely stems from scaling itself rather than the specific technique. The findings suggest pruning as a tool to isolate ICL-related neurons and using external memory to complement down-scaled models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the effects of scaling up or down the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) on two core capabilities: recalling facts seen during pre-training, and processing information presented in-context during inference. The authors evaluate scaling via two techniques - pruning and simply training smaller/larger dense models. They curate a set of tasks to isolate the two capabilities, including closed book QA (tests fact recall), open book QA (tests retrieving answers from context), overriding QA (answer must come from context, not pre-training), and learning simple functions from examples (tests more sophisticated in-context learning). 

The key findings are: Moderate pruning (30-40% of weights removed) significantly harms fact recall, but removing even 60-70% of weights largely preserves in-context learning abilities. The same disparity arises from simply scaling to a smaller dense model. The consistency across pruning and dense scaling suggests the disparity stems fundamentally from scaling model size, rather than being an artifact of pruning. Overall, the work reveals that scaling model size has an inherently different effect on fact recall versus in-context learning abilities. The authors suggest several implications like using pruning to improve interpretability and augmenting LLM memory with retrieved facts.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes evaluating the effects of scaling large language models (LLMs) on two core capabilities - fact recall and in-context learning (ICL). To assess these capabilities, the authors curate a suite of question answering and algorithmic learning tasks requiring different extents of fact recall versus ICL. The authors then evaluate model performance on these tasks under two types of scaling - pruning and dense scaling of model width/depth. Pruning is performed using recent one-shot methods like SparseGPT that prune and update weights simultaneously. The results reveal a disparity - fact recall is significantly harmed by even moderate levels of pruning/downscaling (>30\% parameters removed), whereas ICL capabilities are preserved even under aggressive pruning (60-70\% parameters removed). This disparity holds for both pruning and dense scaling, suggesting the differences stem fundamentally from scaling model size rather than the specific pruning method.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, this paper seems to be studying how scaling the number of parameters in large language models affects their ability to recall facts seen during pre-training and their ability to process information provided in context during inference. The authors evaluate the effects of two scaling techniques - pruning and dense scaling - on these two core capabilities of language models. They find that reducing model size by more than 30% harms fact recall ability but largely preserves the model's ability to process in-context information. The paper suggests that scaling has a disparate effect on fact recall versus in-context learning, which could have implications for areas like model interpretability, memory augmentation, and computational efficiency. The key research questions appear to be: how do techniques like pruning and dense scaling affect fact recall versus in-context learning abilities in language models? And what explains the disparate effects of scaling on these two core capabilities?

- Scaling up/down 
- Pruning
- Dense scaling
