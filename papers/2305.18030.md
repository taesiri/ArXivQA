# [Automated Search-Space Generation Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Automated Search-Space Generation Neural Architecture Search":

Problem:
Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods rely on manually designing a search space beforehand, which requires significant human expertise and limits their applicability. The goal is to automatically generate the search space and train a general deep neural network (DNN) to construct a high-performing, compact sub-network that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal human intervention.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Automated Search-space Generation Neural Architecture Search (ASGNAS), an end-to-end system to automatically generate the search space of a general DNN, train it using a novel hierarchical optimizer, and construct an optimal sub-network. The main components are:

1. Automated Search Space Generation: A graph algorithm that analyzes the DNN architecture and dependency between modules to identify a set of removal structures. This forms the search space for redundancy removal.

2. Hierarchical Half-Space Projected Gradient (H2SPG): A hierarchical sparse optimizer that alternates between a search phase to identify redundant modules while maintaining validity and a training phase to optimize non-redundant parts. It produces a solution with high performance and desired sparsity.  

3. Automated Sub-Network Construction: Constructs a compact, high-performance sub-network by removing modules corresponding to redundant structures identified by H2SPG based on the hierarchy.

Main Contributions:

- First end-to-end system to automate search space generation, training, and sub-network construction for general DNNs.

- Novel graph algorithm to automatically analyze DNN architectures and generate search spaces.

- H2SPG, the first optimizer for hierarchical structured sparsity that considers network topology to ensure validity.  

- State-of-the-art results on DNNs like RegNet, StackedUnets, SuperResNet on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, ImageNet, and other datasets with 50-80% reduction in parameters and FLOPs.

The system significantly reduces manual effort in NAS by automating the pipeline. H2SPG is a breakthrough in hierarchical sparse optimization for DNNs. Together, they enable automated, one-shot NAS for general DNN architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Automated Search-Space Generation Neural Architecture Search (\algacro{}) is an automated system to generate search spaces for general deep neural networks, train them via a novel hierarchical optimizer, and construct high-performing compact sub-networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing ASGNAS, which is:

1) An automated system to train general DNNs that cover all candidate connections and operations and produce high-performing sub-networks in a one-shot manner. 

2) It delivers three main technical contributions to minimize human efforts:

(i) Automated search space generation for general DNNs.

(ii) A Hierarchical Half-Space Projected Gradient (H2SPG) optimizer that leverages the hierarchy and dependency within the generated search space to ensure network validity during optimization, and reliably produces a solution with high performance and hierarchical group sparsity.

(iii) Automated sub-network construction upon the H2SPG solution.

In summary, ASGNAS is an end-to-end automated system to generate search spaces, train DNNs, and construct high-performing and compact sub-networks for general DNNs, with minimal human intervention.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the automated search space generation algorithm analyze the trace graph of a general DNN and establish segment graphs? What key properties of the trace graph does it exploit? 

2) What are the key differences between the hierarchical search phase and hybrid training phase of the Hierarchical Half-Space Projected Gradient (H2SPG) optimizer? How do they complement each other?

3) Why is considering the hierarchy and dependency between different modules crucial for ensuring the validity of the constructed sub-network? How does H2SPG incorporate this? 

4) What modifications need to be made to H2SPG to make it compatible with common practices in neural architecture search like using validation sets and auxiliary architecture variables?

5) The paper mentions the flexibility of using different proxies for saliency score calculation in H2SPG. What are some alternatives to the gradient-based proxy? What are their trade-offs?

6) How does the automated sub-network construction algorithm deal with operations without trainable variables like skip connections? What changes would be needed to make it remove those as well? 

7) What computational overhead does incorporating hierarchy checks introduce in H2SPG compared to non-hierarchical optimizers like DHSPG+? How does the paper analyze time and space complexity?

8) Why does H2SPG succeed in producing valid sub-networks on general DNNs where common sparse optimizers fail? What novel capability does it have?

9) What further benchmarking is needed on larger and more complex DNN architectures and datasets to conclusively establish superiority over state-of-the-art methods?

10) What are the most significant limitations of the current implementation that need to be addressed before adoption for real-world applications? What future work does the paper suggest?
