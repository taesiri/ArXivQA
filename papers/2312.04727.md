## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Designing accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation models is challenging. State-of-the-art deep learning models tend to have exploding model sizes and computational costs, hindering their deployment in real-world applications. The key research question is how to design a 3D segmentation model that achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency under different resource constraints.

Proposed Solution - E2ENet:
The paper proposes Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), which incorporates two key designs for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy:

1. Dynamic Sparse Feature Fusion (DSFF): Adaptively selects and fuses only the most informative multi-scale features from the backbone network while filtering out redundancy. This is done via evolving binary masks that control sparse connectivity.

2. Restricted Depth-Shift in 3D Convolutions: Leverages inter-slice spatial information by shifting feature maps along the depth dimension before 3D convolutions. This captures 3D relationships while maintaining computational complexity similar to 2D convolutions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a highly parameter and computation efficient 3D segmentation network E2ENet with two main designs - DSFF and Restricted Depth-Shift.

- Achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency on three medical segmentation datasets, reducing parameters by up to 4x and FLOPs by 29% while maintaining accuracy.

- Demonstrates comparable performance to nnUNet on multiple datasets, while being significantly more efficient. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.

- Provides extensive analysis - convergence, feature fusion importance visualization, organ volume vs accuracy - to provide insights into model behaviors.

In summary, through efficient network designs, the paper demonstrates leading accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for 3D medical image segmentation across multiple datasets. The techniques show promise for deploying high-accuracy 3D segmentation models under varying resource constraints.
