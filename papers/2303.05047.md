# [Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05047)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to better handle the tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normal patterns and detecting unknown anomalies in reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods. 

The key points are:

- Reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods like autoencoders face a tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normal data well and suppressing anomalies. Suppressing anomalies too much leads to poor reconstruction of diverse normals.

- The authors propose a "diversity-measurable anomaly detection" (DMAD) framework to explicitly model the diversity/deformation of normal patterns while avoiding reconstructing anomalies.

- A Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM) is proposed to estimate multi-scale deformation fields between the reconstructed reference and original input. This captures diversity of normals while anomalies have larger deformations.

- An Information Compression Module (ICM) uses vector quantization to compress encodings into a sparse set of prototypes, avoiding reconstructing anomalies.

- By decoupling diversity/deformation modeling from the class prototypes, the reconstruction error and diversity measure can work together to better detect anomalies. Experiments show improved performance.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling diversity/deformation separately from class prototypes can allow better handling of the tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normals and detecting anomalies. The PDM and ICM modules implement this within a reconstruction framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a diversity-measurable anomaly detection framework called DMAD to better handle the tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normal samples and detecting unknown anomalies. 

- It introduces a Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM) to explicitly model multi-scale deformation fields from the reconstructed reference to the original input. This allows measuring the diversity/severity of anomalies while reconstructing diverse normals.

- It designs an Information Compression Module (ICM) based on VQ-VAE to learn a compact representation of normal prototypes. This avoids transmitting abnormal information through the model.

- It develops two implementations of the DMAD framework using PDM and a variant called Pre-PDM for video anomaly detection and industrial defect detection respectively.

- It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on video anomaly detection datasets Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and industrial defect detection dataset MVTec. The method is robust to contaminated training data and anomaly-like normal samples.

In summary, the key innovation is the diversity-measurable framework and pyramid deformation module to explicitly model and measure diversity/anomaly severity, which helps overcome the limitation of previous reconstruction-based methods in handling diverse normal patterns. The information compression module further enhances the overall anomaly discriminability.
