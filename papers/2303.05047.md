# [Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05047)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to better handle the tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normal patterns and detecting unknown anomalies in reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods. 

The key points are:

- Reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods like autoencoders face a tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normal data well and suppressing anomalies. Suppressing anomalies too much leads to poor reconstruction of diverse normals.

- The authors propose a "diversity-measurable anomaly detection" (DMAD) framework to explicitly model the diversity/deformation of normal patterns while avoiding reconstructing anomalies.

- A Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM) is proposed to estimate multi-scale deformation fields between the reconstructed reference and original input. This captures diversity of normals while anomalies have larger deformations.

- An Information Compression Module (ICM) uses vector quantization to compress encodings into a sparse set of prototypes, avoiding reconstructing anomalies.

- By decoupling diversity/deformation modeling from the class prototypes, the reconstruction error and diversity measure can work together to better detect anomalies. Experiments show improved performance.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling diversity/deformation separately from class prototypes can allow better handling of the tradeoff between reconstructing diverse normals and detecting anomalies. The PDM and ICM modules implement this within a reconstruction framework.
