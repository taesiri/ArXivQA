# [Meta-Explore: Exploratory Hierarchical Vision-and-Language Navigation   Using Scene Object Spectrum Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can an agent effectively navigate in unseen environments and follow natural language instructions, even when it makes mistakes along the way?The key hypothesis is that a hierarchical navigation method with explicit explore and exploit modes can help the agent recover from mistakes by searching for a new local goal, rather than just backtracking. Specifically, the proposed "Meta-Explore" method uses a novel visual representation called "scene object spectrum" (SOS) to choose better local goals during the exploit mode. The overall aim is to develop a more robust vision-and-language navigation agent that can correct its trajectory when needed, leveraging both hierarchical reasoning and semantic visual clues. The paper evaluates this on three VLN benchmarks and shows improved success rates and generalization compared to prior methods.In summary, the core research question is how to design a VLN agent that can correct mistaken actions by exploiting visual semantics within a hierarchical exploration framework. The key hypothesis is that scene object spectrum features enable more effective local goal search during exploitation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes Meta-Explore, a hierarchical navigation method for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) that corrects mistaken short-term actions via efficient exploitation. - It presents a novel visual representation called scene object spectrum (SOS) that captures object information in the spectral domain to provide semantically meaningful clues for choosing near-optimal local goals during exploitation.- It evaluates Meta-Explore on three VLN benchmarks - R2R, SOON, and REVERIE - and shows improved success rate and SPL over baselines. The method also demonstrates better generalization performance.- It highlights the importance of scheduling between exploration and exploitation, and shows exploration and exploitation can complement each other. The topological map constructed during exploration helps efficient exploitation via local goal search.- It shows SOS features in the spectral domain provide better linguistic interpretability than conventional spatial visual features for high-level reasoning during exploitation.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Meta-Explore, a hierarchical VLN method that uses SOS spectral visual features to correct misled actions via efficient local goal search, leading to improved navigation performance and generalization.
