# [Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the solution of   elasticity problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Solving 3D elasticity problems under complex geometries using physics-informed neural networks (PINN) based only on partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrates low convergence. This limits the applicability of PINN for such problems.

- Other issues with vanilla PINN include long training times and high memory consumption.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using separable physics-informed neural networks (SPINN) together with the deep energy method (DEM) to solve elasticity problems. 

- SPINN represents the solution using a separated representation along each coordinate axis rather than a fully coupled representation. This greatly reduces the number of neural network evaluations needed, speeding up training.

- DEM formulates the loss function based on minimizing the energy of the mechanical system rather than enforcing the PDE constraints. This improves accuracy for complex geometries.

Key Contributions:
- The proposed SPINN-DEM method is demonstrated to have much faster convergence and higher accuracy than vanilla PINN or SPINN with PDE loss functions.

- SPINN-DEM can solve complex geometry elasticity problems that vanilla PINN fails on. It also has significantly lower GPU memory consumption than PINN.

- Comparisons are made on two numerical experiments - a loaded beam problem and a thin-walled angle problem. SPINN-DEM clearly outperforms the other methods in accuracy and training efficiency.

- The beam experiment shows SPINN-DEM reaches a 5% error threshold up to 40x faster than SPINN-PDE for predicting displacements.

- For the angle problem, only SPINN-DEM could provide an accurate solution among the methods tested. Error thresholds were reached over 10x faster compared to the beam case.

In summary, the key innovation presented is combining a separable neural network representation with an energy-based loss function to enable accurate and efficient elasticity modeling for complex geometries where vanilla PINN struggles. The superiority of the SPINN-DEM approach is conclusively demonstrated through the numerical experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using separable physics-informed neural networks together with an energy-based loss function to efficiently and accurately solve complex 3D elasticity problems on irregular geometries that cannot be readily handled by vanilla physics-informed neural networks based on partial differential equations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a method for solving elasticity problems based on separable physics-informed neural networks (SPINN) in conjunction with the deep energy method (DEM). 

2. Comparing the speed and accuracy of training for different PINNs: vanilla PINN based on PDEs, SPINN based on PDEs, and SPINN based on DEM. The results show that SPINN-DEM has significantly higher convergence rate and accuracy than the other methods.

3. Demonstrating that the SPINN-DEM approach can solve linear elasticity problems on complex geometries, which is unachievable with PINN based on PDEs. 

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a SPINN-DEM method that outperforms other PINN approaches for solving elasticity problems, especially on complex geometries. The proposed method has higher accuracy and efficiency compared to vanilla PINN and SPINN-PDE.
