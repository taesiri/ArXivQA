# [Effective Real Image Editing with Accelerated Iterative Diffusion   Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04907)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can the inversion process for real images in diffusion models be improved to enable more effective and stable image editing?Specifically, the paper focuses on investigating better numerical solvers and processes for the diffusion inversion step in order to achieve more accurate reconstruction of real images. This then allows for better quality and control when editing and manipulating the inverted images using text prompts.The key hypotheses seem to be:- Modeling inversion as an ODE problem and using more sophisticated numerical methods like fixed-point iteration can improve inversion accuracy compared to simple linear solvers.- Techniques like Anderson acceleration can further help with convergence and stability of the iterative inversion process. - Applying different guidance scales for inversion vs editing steps enables effective editing without sacrificing inversion reliability.- The proposed "accelerated iterative diffusion inversion" method can significantly enhance reconstruction fidelity and editing robustness, especially for very few diffusion steps.So in summary, the core research question is how to develop better inversion techniques to unlock the potential of diffusion models for real image editing tasks. The proposed AIDI method aims to address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing AIDI (Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion), an iterative inversion method for diffusion models that improves reconstruction accuracy compared to prior methods. AIDI treats inversion as finding the fixed point of an implicit function and uses fixed point iteration with acceleration techniques like Anderson acceleration.- A blended guidance technique that allows using different guidance scales for inversion vs editing. This maintains fidelity in unedited regions while allowing larger guidance scales for effective editing. - Showing that the proposed techniques enable effective image editing with very few diffusion steps (as low as 10), where prior methods exhibit significant artifacts. Quantitative experiments demonstrate superiority over prior inversion techniques like PTP, NTI, and EDICT.- Introducing a stochastic editing approach to recover from failure cases of deterministic editing. By sampling multiple edited images and selecting the best, stochastic editing can fix problematic edits that occur with deterministic sampling.In summary, the key innovation is a more accurate and efficient inversion technique for diffusion models that enables high quality image editing and manipulation with fewer sampling steps than prior arts. The proposed AIDI inversion and blended guidance strategies are the main technical contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an accelerated iterative diffusion inversion method to improve image reconstruction and editing accuracy for text-to-image diffusion models, enabling effective real image editing with fewer diffusion steps.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in real image editing using diffusion models:- The key contribution is proposing an Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion (AIDI) method to improve reconstruction accuracy during diffusion inversion. This allows more effective real image editing downstream with fewer diffusion steps. - Previous works like PTP, NTI, and EDICT also aimed to improve reconstruction stability, but had tradeoffs. PTP used simple inversion leading to poor reconstruction. NTI and EDICT improved inversion but incurred extra compute cost. - This paper shows AIDI gets better reconstruction than all methods without extra compute overhead. For example, AIDI gets much lower LPIPS than PTP at 20 steps, matching EDICT at 50 steps.- AIDI also enables the proposed blended guidance technique to apply different guidance scales during inversion and editing. This also improves editing results.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art image editing results both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to PTP, NTI, EDICT. It also shows robustness at very low step counts like 10 steps.- Compared to GAN inversion works like HS-SCLIP, it shows diffusion inversion can enable effective editing without issues like reduced dimensionality.- Overall, this paper significantly pushes the state-of-the-art in real image editing using diffusion models, through innovations in inversion and guidance techniques. The improved accuracy and efficiency look very promising.In summary, this paper makes important contributions to improving the reconstruction and editing abilities of diffusion models for real images, while keeping compute costs minimal. The results and analysis show it advancing the state-of-the-art comprehensively.
