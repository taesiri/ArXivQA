# [Effective Real Image Editing with Accelerated Iterative Diffusion   Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04907)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can the inversion process for real images in diffusion models be improved to enable more effective and stable image editing?Specifically, the paper focuses on investigating better numerical solvers and processes for the diffusion inversion step in order to achieve more accurate reconstruction of real images. This then allows for better quality and control when editing and manipulating the inverted images using text prompts.The key hypotheses seem to be:- Modeling inversion as an ODE problem and using more sophisticated numerical methods like fixed-point iteration can improve inversion accuracy compared to simple linear solvers.- Techniques like Anderson acceleration can further help with convergence and stability of the iterative inversion process. - Applying different guidance scales for inversion vs editing steps enables effective editing without sacrificing inversion reliability.- The proposed "accelerated iterative diffusion inversion" method can significantly enhance reconstruction fidelity and editing robustness, especially for very few diffusion steps.So in summary, the core research question is how to develop better inversion techniques to unlock the potential of diffusion models for real image editing tasks. The proposed AIDI method aims to address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing AIDI (Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion), an iterative inversion method for diffusion models that improves reconstruction accuracy compared to prior methods. AIDI treats inversion as finding the fixed point of an implicit function and uses fixed point iteration with acceleration techniques like Anderson acceleration.- A blended guidance technique that allows using different guidance scales for inversion vs editing. This maintains fidelity in unedited regions while allowing larger guidance scales for effective editing. - Showing that the proposed techniques enable effective image editing with very few diffusion steps (as low as 10), where prior methods exhibit significant artifacts. Quantitative experiments demonstrate superiority over prior inversion techniques like PTP, NTI, and EDICT.- Introducing a stochastic editing approach to recover from failure cases of deterministic editing. By sampling multiple edited images and selecting the best, stochastic editing can fix problematic edits that occur with deterministic sampling.In summary, the key innovation is a more accurate and efficient inversion technique for diffusion models that enables high quality image editing and manipulation with fewer sampling steps than prior arts. The proposed AIDI inversion and blended guidance strategies are the main technical contributions.
