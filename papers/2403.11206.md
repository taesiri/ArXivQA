# [CBR -- Boosting Adaptive Classification By Retrieval of Encrypted   Network Traffic with Out-of-distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical machine learning models for encrypted traffic classification become obsolete when new application classes emerge, requiring costly retraining.
- There is a need for models that can detect and adapt to new classes dynamically without retraining.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a vector-based data representation and Adaptive Classification By Retrieval (CBR) method based on Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search.
- Model indexes vector representations of traffic flows in a distributed search engine database. 
- Classification is done by finding nearest labeled neighbors to new test flow vectors.
- New classes are detected when test flow distances to existing classes exceed a threshold.

Key Contributions:
- CBR allows real-time identification and addition of new classes without retraining, using only a few samples.
- Achieves classification accuracy comparable to Random Forest for known classes. 
- Handles out-of-distribution detection to avoid false positives.
- Can be combined with RF as an ensemble approach, with CBR detecting new classes and RF classifying knowns.
- Statistical features used should provide robustness to future network protocol changes.
- Evaluated on public malware and benign traffic datasets showing ability to incrementally add new malware types.

In summary, the proposed CBR method provides a way to create encrypted traffic classifiers that can efficiently adapt to detect and incorporate new application classes on-the-fly without costly retraining procedures.
