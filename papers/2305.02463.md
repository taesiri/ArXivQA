# [Shap-E: Generating Conditional 3D Implicit Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop conditional generative models that directly produce implicit 3D representations like neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and textured meshes?The key ideas and contributions appear to be:- They train a Transformer-based encoder to map 3D assets to implicit neural representation (INR) parameters. The encoder is trained on a large dataset to encode assets as both NeRFs and signed distance / texture fields.- They then train diffusion models on the latent spaces produced by the encoder. This allows sampling novel view-consistent 3D assets conditioned on images or text. - They compare their proposed model ("Shape-E") to Point-E, a diffusion model over point clouds. Shape-E matches or exceeds Point-E in sample quality despite operating in a higher-dimensional output space.- Shape-E also seems to converge faster than Point-E during training. The authors argue that implicit 3D representations like NeRFs and meshes may be easier to directly generate compared to explicit representations like point clouds.So in summary, the main research question is how to build conditional generative models that directly output implicit 3D representations, which could offer benefits over explicit 3D representations. The key ideas are training encoders to map assets to implicit parameters, and then modeling these latent spaces with diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing Shap-E, a conditional generative model for 3D assets. Shap-E generates the parameters of implicit functions that can be rendered as both textured meshes and neural radiance fields. The key aspects are:- Shap-E trains an encoder to deterministically map 3D assets into implicit function parameters. - A conditional diffusion model is then trained on the encoder outputs to generate new assets conditioned on text or images.- When trained on a large dataset, Shap-E can generate complex and diverse 3D assets in seconds conditioned on text prompts.- Compared to Point-E, a generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional output space with multiple representations.- Shap-E shares architecture, datasets, and conditioning with Point-E, allowing for isolating the effects of the output representation. Surprisingly, the models exhibit similar failure cases when conditioned on images, suggesting behavior depends more on data/architecture than output space.- Qualitatively, Shap-E and Point-E can produce different samples given the same text prompt, indicating modeling differences between explicit and implicit representations.In summary, the main contribution is presenting Shap-E as an implicit conditional generative model for 3D that matches or improves on an explicit model baseline while offering more flexible representations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents Shape-E, a generative model that can generate 3D assets conditioned on text prompts by modeling them as implicit neural representations that can be rendered as textured meshes or neural radiance fields.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few ways this paper on conditional implicit 3D generation compares to other related work:- It proposes a new method, ShapE, for generating 3D assets conditioned on text or images. Most prior work has focused on unconditional 3D generation or conditioning only on images/latents. Directly conditioning on text is still an open challenge.- The paper compares ShapE to PointE, a recent method for generating point clouds. By using the same model architecture, datasets, and conditioning techniques, the comparison helps isolate the effects of generating implicit vs explicit 3D representations. - Unlike some prior work that fits implicit functions to each example via optimization, ShapE uses a Transformer encoder to directly produce parameters of an implicit network. This is more scalable and doesn't require per-sample optimization.- ShapE generates multi-representation outputs (meshes and NeRFs) in a unified way. Most prior implicit 3D generative models produce either meshes or radiance fields, but not both.- The paper demonstrates conditioning the generative process directly on text or images, without needing an image synthesis model like DALL-E as an intermediate step.- The sample quality is not yet on par with some optimization-based text-to-3D methods like DreamFusion. However, ShapE is much faster at inference time since it amortizes optimization into a feedforward network.In summary, this paper pushes forward conditional implicit 3D generation, especially in a scalable and unified way. The comparisons to PointE and analysis of explicit vs implicit modeling are also valuable contributions. However, there is still work to be done to match the sample quality of optimization-based approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the encoder model to better handle detailed textures and fine details in generated 3D assets. The authors note that some detailed textures are lost when encoding real 3D assets, indicating room for improvement in the encoder architecture.- Combining the generative model with optimization-based techniques like DreamFusion. The authors propose using samples from their model to initialize optimization, which could lead to faster convergence and improved results. - Gathering or generating larger annotated 3D datasets. The authors note limitations in composing concepts and binding multiple attributes, which could potentially be addressed by more diverse paired text and 3D data.- Exploring differences between implicit (this work) and explicit (Point-E) generative modeling. The authors observe some qualitative differences between the two approaches given the same data, suggesting further study into their unique modeling capabilities.- Improving the model's understanding of long, complex prompts. The current models are limited in their ability to accurately follow multi-step prompts.- Mitigating biases and stereotypes in the model. The authors show the model exhibits gender biases based on patterns in the training data.- Preventing misuse of generated 3D objects without proper validation. The authors highlight concerns around fabricated objects that may not meet safety standards.So in summary, the main directions are: improving the encoder, combining with optimization, expanding the dataset, studying implicit vs explicit modeling, better compositional understanding, reducing biases, and preventing misuse. The authors lay out a promising research agenda toward more capable and responsible 3D generative modeling.
