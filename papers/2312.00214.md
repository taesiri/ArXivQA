# [Relevance-guided Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural machine translation (NMT) still lags behind in low-resource conditions due to limited parallel/monolingual data. 
- There is a need for efficient and explainable methods to address data scarcity in NMT.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose an explainability-based training approach for NMT using Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP).
- LRP measures the contribution of input tokens to the NMT output. 
- They modify a prior LRP-guided training method to weight the representations of source/target tokens by their LRP relevance score. 
- This emphasizes relevant features and downscales irrelevant ones during training.

Experiments:
- Compare supervised, unsupervised and joint training setups.
- Translate between English, French (high-resource), Gujarati and Kazakh (low-resource) languages.
- Evaluate translation quality using BLEU scores.

Results:
- Marginal improvements over baseline models, especially for low-resource translation tasks.  
- Shows promise for Gujarati and Kazakh translation tasks.
- Indicates potential benefit of using relevance guidance for low-resource NMT.

Main Contributions:
- Novel application of layerwise relevance propagation to guide NMT training.
- Analysis of effect on high-resource (French) and low-resource (Gujarati, Kazakh) translation tasks. 
- Demonstrates utility of leveraging feature relevance for improving low-resource NMT performance.
- Sets ground for further exploration of the approach over more languages and model configurations.

In summary, the paper proposes an explainable training method to emphasize relevant input features for improving low-resource NMT. Experiments show some translation quality gains, especially for morphologically richer languages in low-resource settings.
