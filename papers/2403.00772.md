# [Do Weibo platform experts perform better at predicting stock market?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00772)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis of social media comments has been used for stock market prediction, but existing research has not studied the impact of the financial background of commenters on the accuracy of predictions. 
- This paper asks: How do sentiments of Authorized Financial Advisors (AFAs) on the Weibo platform compare to Unauthorized Financial Advisors (UFAs) for stock market prediction accuracy?

Proposed Solution:
- Extract stock market comments from AFA and UFA users on Weibo platform
- Use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for sentiment analysis classification 
- Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time-series stock market prediction
- Compare prediction accuracy between AFA and UFA user groups

Main Contributions:
- Novel combination of BERT and LSTM networks for stock prediction
- Publicly available implementation of prediction model and datasets
- Key finding that stock market predictions based on AFA users' sentiments are 39.67% more accurate than predictions based on UFA users
- AFA-based prediction reaches highest accuracy of 87% compared to previous stock prediction approaches

In summary, this paper demonstrates a new neural network approach for leveraging financial experts' sentiments on social media to predict stock markets more accurately than using non-expert users' sentiments or previous techniques. The main innovation is accounting for users' financial qualifications.
