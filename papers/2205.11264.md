# [Adaptive Fairness-Aware Online Meta-Learning for Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Adaptive Fairness-Aware Online Meta-Learning for Changing Environments":

Problem:
- Existing fairness-aware online learning methods assume data is from a stationary distribution and aim to minimize loss regret while satisfying long-term fairness constraints. But they perform poorly when the data distribution changes over time.

- The authors introduce the problem of "fairness-aware online meta-learning in changing environments", where the goal is to: (1) generalize to new data domains, (2) minimize loss regret and fairness constraint violations, and (3) adapt to changing data distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- They propose a new regret measure called "Fairly Strongly Adaptive Regret" (FairSAR) which extends strongly adaptive regret with long-term fairness constraints.

- They propose a novel algorithm called "Fair Strongly Adaptive Online Meta-learner" (FairSAOML) which determines model parameters by formulating a bi-level optimization problem with respect to primal parameters (for accuracy) and dual parameters (for fairness). 

- The bi-level optimization interplays between an online fair interval-level learning and an adaptive fairness-aware meta-level learning. The meta-learner combines the weighted outputs of multiple interval-level experts to get the model parameters.

Main Contributions:

- First work to propose fairness-aware online meta-learning for changing environments. Introduce new FairSAR metric.

- Propose FairSAOML algorithm with bi-level optimization of primal-dual parameters to balance accuracy and fairness.

- Provide theoretical analysis bounding loss regret and cumulative fairness violations.

- Empirically demonstrate on real-world datasets that FairSAOML adapts better to changing environments in terms of both accuracy and fairness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
