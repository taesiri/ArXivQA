# [A comprehensive study on fidelity metrics for XAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim to provide insights into black-box AI models. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to evaluate whether an XAI method provides the "true" explanation. 
- Several "fidelity metrics" have been proposed to measure how faithful an explanation is to the model, but these metrics disagree with each other and lack verification.
- There is a need for an objective methodology to verify the reliability of fidelity metrics.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a transparent machine learning model (decision tree) where the ground truth explanation is known to serve as a benchmark.
- Compare various fidelity metrics against the ground truth explanations from the transparent model.
- Any deviation from perfect fidelity indicates issues with the metric.

Experiments:
- Train decision trees on two image datasets - one with simple uniform backgrounds (few out-of-distribution samples) and one with complex textured backgrounds (more OOD samples).
- Calculate four state-of-the-art fidelity metrics on the decision tree explanations: Region Perturbation, Faithfulness Correlation, Faithfulness Estimate, and Infidelity
- Since explanations have perfect fidelity for the transparent decision tree, all metrics should show perfect fidelity.

Results:
- None of the metrics showed perfect fidelity, even on dataset with few OOD samples. Results ranged from 20-80% of ideal fidelity.
- All metrics performed significantly worse on dataset with more OOD samples.
- Lack of consensus between metrics on level of fidelity.

Conclusions:
- Existing fidelity metrics fail to reliably measure explanation fidelity, especially in presence of OOD samples.
- Proposed transparent model benchmark allows objective verification of metrics.
- Imperative to develop new fidelity metrics that can accurately measure fidelity in all practical scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- First objective ground truth benchmark to verify fidelity metrics
- Analysis and comparison of state-of-the-art fidelity metrics showing limitations
- Highlights need for new metrics that can handle out-of-distribution samples


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new methodology to objectively evaluate the reliability of explanation fidelity metrics using transparent models as a benchmark, applies it to analyze four key existing metrics, and finds that all of them are unreliable, especially in the presence of out-of-distribution samples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel methodology to objectively verify the reliability of fidelity metrics for explainable AI (XAI) systems. Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a new approach to evaluate fidelity metrics by using a transparent machine learning model (decision tree) as a benchmark. Since the explanations from the decision tree have perfect fidelity, the fidelity metrics can be compared to this ground truth to assess their accuracy. 

2) The proposed methodology is used to comprehensively analyze four state-of-the-art fidelity metrics. The experiments on synthetic datasets reveal that none of the existing metrics consistently reflect the true fidelity of explanations, especially in the presence of out-of-distribution samples. 

3) The results demonstrate the limitations of current fidelity metrics and underscore the need to develop new metrics that can reliably measure explanation fidelity in practical scenarios. The proposed evaluation methodology is recommended as a benchmark to guide the development of better fidelity metrics for XAI systems.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel, objective methodology to verify fidelity metrics using transparent models, which serves as the first quality benchmark in this space. The experiments also provide new insights into the deficiencies of existing metrics.

The paper focuses on fidelity metrics for XAI methods and proposes a new methodology to objectively evaluate the reliability of such metrics using decision trees and synthetic datasets like AIXI-Shape and TXUXIv3. Key aspects examined include existing fidelity metrics like Region Perturbation, Faithfulness Correlation, Faithfulness Estimate, and Infidelity. The experiments highlight issues with current fidelity metrics, especially sensitivity to out-of-distribution samples, and the need for improved metrics benchmarked using the proposed transparent decision tree approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using decision trees as a transparent model to obtain ground truth explanations. What are the strengths and limitations of using decision trees in this manner? How could the methodology be improved by using other transparent models?

2. The paper calculates fidelity metrics on the explanations obtained from the decision trees. However, the fidelity metrics were originally designed for convolutional neural networks. How valid is it to apply these fidelity metrics to decision tree explanations? What adaptations may need to be made? 

3. The paper concludes that current fidelity metrics are not reliable enough for real world usage. However, the experiments used synthetic datasets of simple images. How likely is it that the metrics would perform even worse on more complex, real world datasets? What evidence supports this?

4. The methodology uses predetermined train/test splits from the datasets. How would results differ if multiple train/test splits were used instead? Why would this be an important analysis to do?  

5. The paper hypothesizes that fidelity metrics would be sensitive to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. The second experiment confirms this finding. However, what constitutes an OOD sample is not conclusively defined. How should OOD samples be rigorously defined in order to further analyze this hypothesis?

6. The paper analyzes four key fidelity metrics from the literature. What motivated the choice of these specific four metrics and the exclusion of others? What potential limitations could this choice of metrics impose on the conclusions?

7. The paper concludes the studied fidelity metrics are not reliable enough for practical usage. However, no concrete threshold or standard is provided for what constitutes “reliable enough”. What quantitative standards could be set to make this conclusion more objective? 

8. The performance metrics in Table 2 indicate there is room for improvement in the decision tree models. How might the fidelity results differ if the underlying models had higher performance? What analyses could be done?

9. The paper proposes a novel methodology using decision trees to benchmark fidelity metrics. What other quantitative and qualitative criteria should be considered to comprehensively evaluate the usefulness of this methodology as a benchmark?  

10. The paper suggests developing new, reliable fidelity metrics in future work. What open questions remain regarding how new metrics could surpass the issues faced by current metrics, especially pertaining to OOD samples or real world datasets?
