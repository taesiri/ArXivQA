# [Long-Term Fair Decision Making through Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Long-Term Fair Decision Making through Deep Generative Models":

Problem:
- Traditional fair machine learning methods focus on one-shot fair decisions. However, in sequential decision-making systems like loans, college admissions etc, decisions affect future user features which in turn affect future decisions. This causes feedback loops and distribution shifts over time.

- Simply satisfying one-shot fairness notions like demographic parity and equal opportunity at each timestep does not ensure long-term fairness i.e. mitigation of disparities between groups over the long run. 

- The goal is to learn a decision model that can reshape the data distribution when deployed over time to achieve long-term fairness while limiting the use of sensitive attributes in the model itself.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage temporal causal graphs to model causal relationships between user features, sensitive attribute and decisions over time. 

- Define long-term fairness metric as 1-Wasserstein distance between interventional distributions of different demographic groups at a future timestep T.

- Propose a 3-phase learning framework:
   1) Train base classifier 
   2) Train recurrent conditional GAN (RCGAN) to simulate system and generate observational and interventional distributions
   3) Train final classifier on RCGAN generated data to optimize for long-term fairness, utility and one-shot fairness.

- Formulate as performative risk minimization problem and use repeated gradient descent for training.

Contributions:
- Novel formulation of long-term fairness based on temporal causal graphs and Wasserstein distance metric
- Three phase learning framework leveraging RCGANs to generate reliable long term data
- Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate improved long-term fairness over baselines


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a deep learning framework to train sequential decision-making models that can mitigate group disparities over the long term by leveraging deep generative models to predictively generate high-fidelity observational and interventional data for training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel framework for long-term fair decision making that aims to mitigate group disparity over time in sequential decision-making systems. 

2) It formulates long-term fairness based on the temporal causal graph and uses the 1-Wasserstein distance between the interventional distributions of different demographic groups at a future time step as the quantitative metric.

3) It develops a three-phase learning framework that trains a decision model on high-fidelity data generated by a deep generative model (RCGAN). The optimization problem is treated as performative risk minimization and solved using repeated gradient descent.

4) It conducts empirical evaluations on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in balancing long-term fairness, local fairness and utility, compared to methods based on traditional fairness notions.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of deep generative models to simulate system dynamics and generate reliable interventional data for training sequential decision models that can mitigate group disparities over the long term.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Long-term fairness - The paper focuses on achieving fairness over a long period of time in sequential decision-making systems, rather than just at one time step. This concept of "long-term fairness" is central to the work. 

- Temporal causal graphs - The paper uses temporal causal graphs to model the causal relationships between variables over time and formulate the long-term fairness metric.

- Interventional distributions - Leveraging the temporal causal graph, the paper treats long-term fairness as minimizing the difference in the interventional distributions of different demographic groups at a future time step.

- Deep generative models - A recurrent conditional GAN is used to generate observational and interventional data which is then used to train the decision-making model to achieve long-term fairness.

- Performative risk minimization - The optimization problem for training the decision model is formulated as a type of performative risk minimization where the model affects the distribution of the data it is trained on.

- Local fairness constraints - In addition to long-term fairness, local fairness constraints based on direct discrimination are imposed at each time step when training the decision model.

In summary, the key focus is on operationalizing and optimizing for long-term or dynamic fairness in sequential decision systems using temporal causal modeling, deep generative models, and specialized risk minimization techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a quantitative metric of long-term fairness based on the 1-Wasserstein distance between the interventional distributions of different demographic groups. Can you explain more intuitively why this is an appropriate metric to measure long-term fairness? How does minimizing this distance help mitigate group disparities?

2. The paper develops a three-phase learning framework to achieve long-term fairness. Can you walk through each phase and explain the rationale behind the techniques used in each one? What is the connection between the phases?  

3. The generative model used in the second phase is based on a recurrent conditional GAN (RCGAN). What are the benefits of using an RCGAN architecture over a vanilla GAN for this application? How does the RCGAN capture the temporal dynamics?

4. Explain the concept of performative risk minimization and why the repeated gradient descent algorithm was adopted to solve this optimization problem. What challenges arise during this phase of training?

5. The paper demonstrates that minimizing the proposed long-term fairness metric enables reconciling demographic parity and equal opportunity under certain conditions. Can you explain this theoretical result in more detail? What insights does this provide about the metric?  

6. One practical challenge is that the true causal graph may not be known in real-world applications. How robust is the proposed method to inaccuracies or errors in the assumed causal structure? Would it still be beneficial if the temporal relationships are only approximately correct?

7. The experimental evaluation relies on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets. What are the limitations of evaluating on such datasets compared to real-world sequential decision-making scenarios? How could the experiments be extended to further demonstrate effectiveness?

8. How does the proposed method specifically address the challenges that arise from feedback loops and distribution shift in sequential decision systems? What types of feedback mechanisms is it designed to handle?

9. The sensitive attribute is assumed to be binary in the paper. How could the approach be extended to accommodate more complex sensitive attributes, such as continuously-valued ones? Would the overall learning framework remain applicable?

10. One societal concern around affirmative action policies is potential reverse discrimination. Does the proposed data-driven approach provide any advantages or alleviate some of these concerns compared to affirmative action? Why or why not?
