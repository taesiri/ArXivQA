# [FastOcc: Accelerating 3D Occupancy Prediction by Fusing the 2D   Bird's-Eye View and Perspective View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D occupancy prediction is important for autonomous driving to understand surrounding scenes. It outputs voxel-wise status and semantics for comprehensive 3D understanding. 
- Recent works have achieved good accuracy but neglect inference speed which is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Many methods take over 300ms for inference.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose FastOcc method to accelerate 3D occupancy prediction while maintaining accuracy.
- Analyze network effect and latency from 4 aspects: input resolution, backbone, view transformation, prediction head.
- Find prediction head has optimization potential - replace 3D convolutions with novel residual-like architecture:
   - Lift image features to coarse 3D voxels using fast view transformation
   - Collapse 3D voxels to 2D bird's eye view (BEV) and decode features using 2D FCN which is faster
   - Complement missing height info in BEV by interpolating 3D voxels from image features 
   - Integrate BEV and interpolated voxels for final prediction
- Overall simplify 3D task to 2D + interpolated 3D features to cut computation cost    

Main Contributions:
- Detailed analysis of different network components on speed and accuracy 
- Novel FastOcc architecture that uses 2D BEV decoding and integrates interpolated 3D voxel features
- Achieves state-of-the-art 40.75 mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with 63ms latency, 4-5x faster than previous methods
- Can further accelerate to 32ms using TensorRT while retaining accuracy
- Demonstrates 3D perception for autonomous driving can achieve real-time efficiency without compromising accuracy

In summary, the paper performs in-depth analysis to identify optimization opportunities and proposes a novel simplified architecture to accelerate 3D occupancy prediction to real-time speeds without sacrificing accuracy. The method and analysis provide valuable insights for efficient 3D perception.
