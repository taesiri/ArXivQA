# [Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Convolution Neural Network Models of   Evolving Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural networks (NNs) have become popular for modeling complex spatial-temporal processes, but they can be prone to overfitting and lack of interpretability. This is concerning for scientific machine learning (SciML) applications where decisions carry high stakes. There is a need for uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods suitable for NNs to promote model transparency and trust.

Methods: 
The paper explores Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) where probability distributions are placed over the NN weights. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) are used to approximate the posterior distribution over weights. HMC is treated as a gold standard but scales poorly. SVGD uses particle gradient descent for better scaling. A variant called projected SVGD (pSVGD) reduces the effective dimensionality.

Architecture:
Two exemplar problems are studied - modeling mechanical response of polycrystals with a graph CNN + RNN, and modeling gas diffusion in polycrystals with a graph CNN + neural ODE. Both encode an initial condition into a latent state, evolve it in time, and decode to predictions.

Results:
On the smaller networks, SVGD uncertainty quantification is comparable to HMC in terms of similarity of predictions to data and captured uncertainty. pSVGD struggles likely due to convoluted posteriors from instability and time integration constraints. On larger networks infeasible for HMC, SVGD and pSVGD behave similarly with more data. With less data, pSVGD differs more as the prior dominates.

Contributions:
1) Enabled UQ for GCNNs in complex physics-based models
2) Showed SVGD is a viable alternative to Monte Carlo for BNNs
3) Gained insights into extremely narrow BNN posteriors from model instability and time integration needs

The paper demonstrates promising capability of SVGD for UQ of complex recurrent GCNN models common in scientific applications, using two materials physics case studies. The projections in pSVGD do not seem beneficial for these unstable models.
