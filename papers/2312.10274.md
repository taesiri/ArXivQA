# [Operator-learning-inspired Modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential   Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10274)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are continuous-depth neural networks that have shown strong performance on various machine learning tasks. A key component is modeling the time derivative dh/dt, which is typically done using standard neural network architectures like fully-connected or convolutional layers. 

- Neural operators have been proposed for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs), but not been explored much for general machine learning tasks. Since ODEs are a type of PDE, the authors hypothesize that modeling the dh/dt term in NODEs as a neural operator could enhance performance.

- Existing neural operators like Fourier neural operators (FNOs) don't perform well when directly applied to define the dh/dt term in NODEs. So a new architecture is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose branched Fourier neural operators (BFNOs), a new neural operator designed specifically for modeling the dh/dt term in NODEs.

- BFNOs use dynamic global convolutional operations with multiple kernels in the Fourier domain. This provides more expressive learning capacity compared to standard FNOs.

- BFNOs have two processing paths - one with Fourier transforms and dynamic convolutions, another with just a linear transformation. The paths are merged with an activation function to output the next layer.

Main Contributions:
- First application of neural operators to model the ODE function in NODEs. Previous works have used standard network architectures.

- Introduction of BFNO, a novel neural operator architecture tailored for NODE modeling with dynamic global convolutions and dual computation paths.

- Extensive experiments showing BFNO-NODEs outperform state-of-the-art NODE methods on image classification, time series classification and image generation tasks. Up to 20% better accuracy demonstrated.

- Ablation studies validate design choices like the number of parallel convolutions and comparing to other neural operators.
