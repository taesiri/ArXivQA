# [Stability and Multigroup Fairness in Ranking with Uncertain Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper considers the problem of deriving rankings from machine learning predictors that output probability distributions over classes rather than deterministic predictions. When predictions have inherent uncertainty, it is unclear how to best convert them into rankings in a way that is fair, stable, and preserves the uncertainty information. 

The authors argue that the following properties are important for a ranking function that maps predictions to rankings:

- Anonymity: Treat all individuals symmetrically, without using identity information
- Stability: Small changes in predicted class probabilities should only induce small changes in rankings 
- Fairness: Composition with an individually fair predictor should result in fair rankings

Key Results

- The authors show that stability composes gracefully with individual fairness - if the predictor satisfies individual fairness and the ranking function is stable, the composition also satisfies a natural notion of individual fairness. This motivates desiring stability.

- They prove that no non-trivial deterministic ranking can be stable or anonymous. Hence randomness is necessary for stability and anonymity.

- They demonstrate that the uncertainty aware (UA) ranking function, which randomly orders individuals by sampling possible classifications based on predicted class probabilities, is anonymous and stable.

- A key theorem shows that UA ranking provably preserves statistical notions of multiaccuracy and multicalibration. That is, if the predictor outputs unbiased estimates over groups of individuals, then the induced UA ranking also remains unbiased over those groups in a natural sense.

- Through the choice of which groups to enforce multiaccuracy/multicalibration over, UA ranking effectively interpolates between individual and group fairness at the granularity specified by the predictor accuracy guarantees.

- Experiments on real data corroborate the stability guarantees and demonstrate that UA rankings can achieve reasonable utility compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper establishes uncertainty aware rankings as a principled approach to handle uncertainty in machine learning predictors, with strong fairness and stability guarantees. The rankings provably interpolate between individual and group fairness notions while preserving information about uncertainty.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies stability and fairness properties of uncertainty aware ranking functions, which map probabilistic predictions to distributions over rankings, and shows that they naturally compose with multiaccurate predictors to achieve multigroup fairness guarantees.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proving that the uncertainty aware (UA) ranking function proposed by Singh and Kleinberg naturally composes with multiaccurate or multicalibrated predictors to produce fair and stable rankings. Specifically:

- The paper shows that UA rankings satisfy anonymity and stability, two desirable properties for ranking functions. In particular, stability allows fair rankings to be obtained when UA rankings are combined with individually fair predictors.

- The main theoretical result is that UA rankings preserve the multiaccuracy and multicalibration guarantees of the underlying predictors. This means that if the predictor satisfies certain group-level fairness notions, the induced UA ranking will as well. The result can be viewed as interpolating between individual and group fairness.

- Experiments on real-world data sets corroborate the stability properties of UA rankings. The experiments also demonstrate that UA rankings can achieve reasonably high utility compared to baselines, while retaining provable fairness and stability guarantees.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous analysis showing that the UA ranking framework composes gracefully with notions of fair classification to produce fair, stable, and useful rankings in the presence of uncertain predictions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Ranking functions - Maps from probabilistic predictions to distributions over rankings of items/individuals

- Stability - Small changes in input predictions lead to small changes in output rankings

- Anonymity - Rankings depend only on predictions, not identities of individuals

- Uncertainty aware (UA) rankings - Distributions over rankings based on sampling possible futures according to predicted merit distributions 

- Multiaccuracy - Predictions are unbiased on average over specified subgroups

- Multicalibration - Predictions are calibrated over specified subgroups

- Individual fairness - Similar individuals have similar outcomes

- Utility - A model for quantifying the value extracted from a ranking 

- Tradeoffs - Balancing competing objectives like fairness, stability, and utility

The paper seems to focus on stability and multigroup fairness properties of uncertainty aware rankings, and their compatibility with common notions of fairness for probabilistic classifiers. Key results show that UA rankings can interpolate between individual and group fairness guarantees, while achieving better stability than deterministic rankings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) This paper proposes a notion of "stability" for ranking functions. Explain in detail what stability means in this context and why it is an important property for ranking functions to satisfy. 

2) The paper shows that deterministic ranking functions cannot be both stable and anonymous except in trivial cases. Explain this result and discuss why introducing randomness is necessary to achieve stability and anonymity.

3) The uncertainty aware (UA) ranking function is proposed as a stable and anonymous ranking approach. Walk through the formal definition of the UA ranking function step-by-step and discuss the intuition behind its construction. 

4) Prove Proposition 3.3 regarding the exact computation of the UA ranking function. Explain why the independence assumption between individuals' merit distributions enables this tractable computation.  

5) The paper shows that stability composes with individual fairness. Unpack this composition result. In particular, what is the notion of individual fairness used here and how does stability interact with it in the ranking context?

6) Explain the concepts of multiaccuracy and multicalibration for predictors. How do these statistical fairness properties for predictors relate to fairness properties for the induced rankings?

7) Walk through the proof of Theorem 4.1 showing that UA rankings preserve multiaccuracy/multicalibration guarantees. What aspects of UA ranking make this composition possible?

8) Discuss the sense in which UA rankings can be viewed as interpolating between individual and group fairness. How does the choice of subgroups that the predictor is multiaccurate/multicalibrated over impact the induced rankings? 

9) Introduce the utility model for rankings used in Section 5. Then explain why the optimal utility ranking function cannot in general be stable.

10) The mixed ranking $\rmix$ is proposed to trade off between stability/fairness and utility. Unpack the approximate stability and fairness guarantees for this mixed approach. When might such an approximate ranking be useful in practice?
