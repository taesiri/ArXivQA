# [Improving Robustness of LiDAR-Camera Fusion Model against Weather   Corruption from Fusion Strategy Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
This paper evaluates the robustness of LiDAR-camera fusion models for 3D object detection against common weather corruption like fog, rain, snow and sunlight. Previous works have assessed robustness of single-modal and fusion models but lack analysis on how fusion strategy impacts robustness and how to improve it. This paper aims to address these gaps.  

Methods and Contributions:
1) The paper evaluates robustness of fusion models from perspective of fusion strategy:
- Compares 4 fusion models (virtual point, voxel, ray, BEV) to find virtual point model has best robustness 
- Analyzes impact of corrupting LiDAR vs camera branch on robustness 

2) Proposes a simple yet effective method to improve robustness by flexibly weighting fusion between LiDAR and camera features to adapt to weather conditions. This is realized via sigmoid and attention implementations.

3) Conducts experiments on 4 fusion models with 2 lightweight enhancements each. Results verify broad applicability and effectiveness of the proposed flexible weighting idea in improving robustness against weather corruption by 2-6% AP.  

In summary, key contributions are - fine-grained analysis of fusion strategy on robustness, and a generalizable approach to enhance robustness of fusion models by flexible weighting between modalities. The experiments validate improvements across diverse fusion models.
