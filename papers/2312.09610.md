# [A Synthesis of Green Architectural Tactics for ML-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09610)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning (ML) models have high computational requirements for training and inference, leading to significant energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, there is a lack of concrete guidelines on how to develop environmentally sustainable ML-enabled systems.

Solution:
- The paper provides a catalog of 30 green architectural tactics for ML-enabled systems to guide the development of sustainable systems. An architectural tactic is a high-level design technique for improving a quality attribute, in this case environmental sustainability.

- The tactics are synthesized from an analysis of 51 research papers on Green AI and organized into 6 categories: data-centric, algorithm design, model optimization, model training, deployment, and management.

- Examples of specific tactics include reducing data redundancy, decreasing model complexity, considering lightweight algorithms, enhancing model sparsity, using energy-efficient hardware, and monitoring power usage.

Contributions:
- A collection of 30 tactics to serve as an initial reference guide for exploring Green AI from a software engineering perspective.

- The tactics target different artifacts (data, models, algorithms) and various stages of the ML model and system development life cycle.

- Most tactics aim to improve energy efficiency as the primary quality attribute, but some also consider accuracy and performance trade-offs. 

- 17 of the tactics have empirical evidence quantifying their impact, while the others are experience-based suggestions.

- The collection of tactics has the potential to substantially reduce the environmental impact of ML-enabled systems if widely adopted.

- The tactics are made available in easily consumable online formats to facilitate their widespread use and extension.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive set of green architectural tactics that can guide companies and teams on how to develop ML systems sustainably while minimizing energy consumption. Adopting these tactics can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of AI.
