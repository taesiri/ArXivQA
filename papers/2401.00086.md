# [Quantifying Policy Administration Cost in an Active Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Access control policies need to be continuously updated as organizations evolve over time (e.g. new users, devices join). This task of revising policies is called policy administration. 
- Past access control research lacks a formal way to quantify the "cost" of policy administration. Without a quantification method, it is hard to substantiate claims that a model reduces administration costs.

Proposed Solution:
- Model policy administration as an "active learning" process between a learner (policy administrator) and a teacher (encapsulates realities like new entities, policy assessments etc.). 
- Use the framework to study administration "cost" of domain-based access control policies. Cost is quantified by the number of queries the learner asks.
- Define a learning protocol with queries like:
   - Discover new entity (models new users/devices)  
   - Check access permission between entities (models policy deliberation)
   - Get errors in current policy (models policy assessment)
- Define criteria for successful learning. Evaluate learners by quantifying administration cost and errors.

Main Contributions:
- First computational model to quantify policy administration cost using active learning and query complexity.
- Demonstrate administration cost depends not only on access control model but also the policy administration strategy.
- Show heuristic reasoning enables scalability by allowing small errors. Formalize tradeoff between cost and errors.
- Methodology to substantiate claims of reduced administration costs for other access control models.

In summary, the paper provides a novel active learning framework to quantitatively reason about the policy administration process and tradeoffs involved.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using an active learning framework to model the process of evolving access control policies over time in order to quantify the cost of policy administration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops an active learning framework for modeling and quantifying the cost of policy administration in access control. Specifically, it models the policy administrator as a learner who queries an environment (teacher) to gradually learn the access control policies. This allows formally quantifying the cost in terms of query complexity.

2. It demonstrates using this framework that the cost of policy administration depends not only on the access control model itself but also on the policy administration strategy. By comparing different strategies, it shows that using appropriate heuristics can significantly reduce the administration cost, at the expense of allowing some errors. 

3. It provides a methodology for future work to substantiate claims about an access control model reducing policy administration costs. This involves devising an active learning framework, modeling policy administration strategies, analyzing their convergence, and quantifying their administration cost and errors relative to a baseline.

In summary, the main contribution is in providing a formal modeling approach to quantify and compare the cost of evolving access control policies under different models and strategies. The key insight is that heuristics and tolerating some errors enable scalable and low-cost policy administration.

The paper develops an active learning framework to model and quantify the cost of policy administration in access control, especially for domain-based policies. It introduces different types of queries to capture various aspects of reality and policy deliberation. The framework allows the comparison of different policy administration strategies, like the tireless and conservative learner, in terms of metrics like query complexity and errors. Overall, the key focus is on studying administration cost, heuristics, and strategies related to revising access control policies as new entities are introduced over time.
