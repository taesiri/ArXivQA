# [Meet JEANIE: a Similarity Measure for 3D Skeleton Sequences via   Temporal-Viewpoint Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video sequences exhibit significant nuisance variations like speed of actions, temporal locations, and subjects' poses. This causes temporal-viewpoint misalignment when comparing two sets of frames or evaluating sequence similarity.
- Existing action recognition models rely on large datasets and cannot adapt well to novel classes. 
- Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) models are lacking, especially for 3D skeleton sequences.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes JEANIE, a similarity measure for 3D skeleton sequences, for few-shot action recognition. 
- JEANIE achieves joint temporal and camera viewpoint alignment between a support-query sequence pair to find the optimal alignment path. This aligns sequences and factors out nuisance variations.
- To simulate viewpoints, the skeletons are rotated using Euler angles or generated based on stereo camera projection geometry.
- JEANIE combines dynamic time warping for temporal alignment with a new transportation plan for joint temporal-viewpoint warping. 
- An unsupervised dictionary learning method for FSAR using JEANIE is also proposed.
- Simple strategies are introduced to fuse the supervised and unsupervised models.

Main Contributions:
- JEANIE measure for joint temporal and viewpoint alignment of 3D skeleton sequences. Evaluated for few-shot action recognition.
- Method to simulate different camera viewpoints by Euler rotations or stereo projections.
- Unsupervised dictionary learning model for FSAR using JEANIE.
- Fusion strategies to combine supervised and unsupervised models.  
- State-of-the-art results on standard datasets NTU-60, NTU-120, Kinetics and UWA3D for supervised, unsupervised and fused FSAR models.

The summary covers the key problem being solved, the proposed JEANIE solution and its working to align sequences, the unsupervised extension, fusion models, and the main contributions of the work in advancing few-shot action recognition for 3D skeleton sequences.
