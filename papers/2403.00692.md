## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Emerging landscape of large, heterogeneous nanosatellite constellations for Earth observation that need to collaborate to meet stringent requirements like revisit times and spatial resolution. 
- Efficiently scheduling inter-satellite communications through contact plan (CP) design is complex, with current solutions requiring ground-based coordination or being computationally limited.

Proposed Solution
- Model constellations and CP as dynamic networks, employ graph-based techniques using a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) to evaluate CP performance and update it with a simulated annealing optimization algorithm.

Key Contributions
- Formulate CP design problem for heterogeneous constellations with traffic information without periodicity assumptions.
- Propose a DGNN architecture to model dynamic satellite networks that integrates spatial graph convolutions and temporal RNN processing.
- Trained DGNN can predict average network delay with 3.6 minute mean absolute error. 
- Optimization results show proposed method can successfully design CP for large networks, improving delay by 29.1%, with 20x faster evaluations than traditional methods.

Main impact is developing a learning-based CP optimization method for complex heterogeneous constellations that balances performance and scalability. Foundations established for utilizing dynamic graph-based learning in autonomous management of evolving nanosatellite networks.
