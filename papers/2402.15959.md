# [Towards Robust Image Stitching: An Adaptive Resistance Learning against   Compatible Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image stitching algorithms integrate images from different viewpoints into a single wide field-of-view image. This relies on accurate feature matching between overlapping regions of images.
- Deep learning based image stitching methods achieve good performance but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - imperceptible perturbations that degrade feature matching and alignment accuracy.
- Enhancing robustness of image stitching against such attacks is critical for reliable stitching performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a stitching-oriented attack (SoA) to target and amplify the alignment loss between images, severely deteriorating stitching performance.
- Propose an adaptive adversarial training (AAT) strategy to balance attack resistance and stitching accuracy in determining robust stitching architectures.
- AAT alternatively optimizes architecture parameters for robustness using mixed clean and attacked data, and weight parameters for accuracy using only clean data.

Key Contributions:
- First work to improve adversarial robustness of learning-based image stitching using tailored attacks and training. 
- SoA attack grounded in homography and shared region consistency losses deteriorates stitching performance more than other attacks.
- AAT adaptively determines optimal architecture for robustness without compromising stitching accuracy.
- Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AAT model resists SoA and other attacks with negligible performance gap between benign and attacked scenarios.

In summary, this paper pioneers a robust image stitching framework using specialized attacks and adaptive adversarial training to balance robustness and performance for reliable stitching outcomes.
