# [TroubleLLM: Align to Red Team Expert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can manifest unsafe behaviors like bias and toxicity, so testing them before deployment is important. 
- Existing methods for generating test prompts are expensive, limited in diversity, lack controllability, and don't cover latest attack methods.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose TroubleLLM, the first LLM for generating controllable test prompts to assess LLM safety issues. 
- Train TroubleLLM via text style transfer with supervision from keywords, topics and instruction methods to increase in-context learning and meet generation requirements.
- Use unsupervised Rank Query from Model Feedback (RQMF) to facilitate training TroubleLLM on more misleading prompts to improve effectiveness.

Main Contributions:
- First work using an LLM (TroubleLLM) to generate controllable test prompts to assess LLM safety.
- Supervise TroubleLLM training with keywords, topics, instructions to increase controllability. 
- Propose RQMF strategy to train TroubleLLM on better misleading prompts without human labels.
- Experiments show TroubleLLM generates higher quality and more controllable prompts than previous methods and LLMs.

In summary, this paper develops a novel LLM called TroubleLLM to automatically generate controllable and effective test prompts to evaluate safety issues in other LLMs. RQMF allows unsupervised training to improve misleading capability. Evaluations demonstrate the superiority of TroubleLLM over existing methods.
