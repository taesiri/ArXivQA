# [Poisoning Programs by Un-Repairing Code: Security Concerns of   AI-generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-based code generators (e.g. GitHub Copilot) translate natural language descriptions into source code to improve developer productivity. 
- However, they rely on massive datasets from unreliable online sources, making them vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. An attacker can manipulate the training data to steer the model to generate insecure code containing vulnerabilities.
- This could lead to the release of vulnerable software that may harm end users.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel targeted data poisoning attack against AI code generators. 
- They replace a small portion of safe code snippets in the training data with semantically equivalent versions containing vulnerabilities, without changing the original natural language descriptions.
- To automatically generate vulnerable code, they propose a "reverse code repair" model trained to translate safe code into insecure code.
- They evaluate the attack against state-of-the-art NL-to-code models in both white-box and more realistic black-box threat models.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of a new data poisoning threat against AI code generators to make them generate vulnerable code.
- A dynamic poison generation method based on reverse code repair to automatically create poisoned samples.
- Extensive evaluation plan to assess impact of the attack on multiple models and programming languages.
- Discussion of potential defenses applicable before, during and after model training.

In summary, the paper presents a novel targeted data poisoning attack to compromise the integrity of AI code generators and make them produce insecure code. The attack could enable malicious actors to distribute vulnerable software unnoticed.
