# [Data-driven architecture to encode information in the kinematics of   robots and artificial avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Human movements can encode information like emotions, but observers may not accurately decode this information from the movements. 
- It is important for robots and avatars interacting with humans to clearly encode emotions in their movements for better social interactions.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a data-driven control architecture to modify the kinematics of robots/avatars to encode desired information like emotions. 
- Use a dataset of human movements labeled with encoded emotions to train a model to classify emotion encoding.  
- For a new human movement, find the closest matching example in the dataset with the desired emotion encoding, and blend the human movement with this reference to encode the emotion while minimizing changes to the original movement.
- Additional constraints can be added, like enforcing the modified movement ends close to the original, using reinforcement learning.

Key Contributions:
- Formalized the problem of encoding emotions in movements as an optimization problem with similarity and emotion encoding constraints.
- Proposed a data-driven framework to solve this by blending human motions with emotional reference motions from a dataset.
- Developed solutions for offline and online implementation, with options to enforce terminal constraints.
- Validated the approach on a dataset of human reach-to-grasp motions with and without encoded fear, successfully encoding fear in motions without fear with minimal changes.

The paper makes important contributions towards enabling robots and avatars to clearly convey emotions to humans through their movements to improve social interaction. The data-driven framework is flexible to encoding different information beyond just emotions as well.
