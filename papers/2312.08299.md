# [Conceptualizing Suicidal Behavior: Utilizing Explanations of Predicted   Outcomes to Analyze Longitudinal Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08299)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores using token attribution from large language models (LLMs) to detect suicidal ideation in social media posts, specifically Reddit data from the UMD dataset. The authors fine-tuned several LLMs, with MentalRoBERTa demonstrating the best performance, and generated token attributions using Layer Integrated Gradients. They propose a methodology to leverage these token attributions, even scaled by TF-IDF, to classify suicidal risk without needing the LLM during inference, reducing computational overhead. Preliminary classification results indicate promise when merging risk levels into binary classes like no risk versus any risk. The authors highlight the utility of interpretable AI techniques in mental healthcare and suggest future work comparing against state-of-the-art models, incorporating multimodal analysis, and conducting more granular longitudinal assessments of risk. Overall, this paper makes contributions in explainable AI and suicide prevention through a novel approach to detect suicidal ideation in social media posts.
