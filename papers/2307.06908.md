# [Generating Benchmarks for Factuality Evaluation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06908)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we effectively evaluate the factuality of language models in open-ended text generation?The key points are:- Existing methods for evaluating LM factuality have limitations. Methods that test isolated facts don't reflect open-ended generation. Methods that sample free-form generations may be biased towards common facts. - The authors propose a new approach called FACTOR (Factual Assessment via Corpus Transformation) that transforms an input corpus into an evaluation benchmark. It perturbs factual statements into non-factual variations to directly test the LM's ability to assign greater likelihood to the original fact.- The authors apply FACTOR to construct two new benchmarks from Wikipedia and news articles. Experiments show FACTOR accuracy increases with model size and retrieves augmentation. It correlates with but sometimes differs from perplexity. Manual evaluation shows it better reflects factuality in open-ended generation.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed FACTOR method can effectively evaluate factual capabilities of LMs for open-ended generation in a given domain, in a way that complements existing methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate and validate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes FACTOR, a new method for evaluating the factual correctness of language models (LMs) during text generation. FACTOR automatically transforms a factual corpus into a benchmark that tests the LM's ability to assign higher likelihood to factual statements vs. similar but incorrect variations.2. It applies FACTOR to construct two new challenging benchmarks, Wiki-FACTOR based on Wikipedia and News-FACTOR based on news articles.3. It evaluates a suite of large LMs on these benchmarks and shows FACTOR scores increase with model size but are still challenging even for very large models like OPT-66B.4. It demonstrates significant gains in FACTOR scores when augmenting LMs with a simple retrieval component, directly showing improved factuality from retrieval grounding.5. It analyzes the correlation between FACTOR accuracy and perplexity, showing they are aligned but can disagree on model ranking. Further experiments reinforce FACTOR as predictive of factuality in open-ended generation.In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of FACTOR as a novel automatic benchmark for directly evaluating and comparing factual capabilities of LMs during text generation. The benchmarks and analysis help validate FACTOR as an informative metric.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called FACTOR for evaluating the factual accuracy of language models by automatically transforming a factual corpus into a benchmark that tests the model's ability to distinguish true statements from similar but incorrect ones.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few ways this paper compares to other research in evaluating the factuality of language models:- The paper proposes a new method called FACTOR (Factual Assessment via Corpus Transformation) for evaluating language model factuality. This is a complementary approach to existing work like Lee et al. (2022) and Min et al. (2023) which sample text from models and check factuality. FACTOR instead perturbs factual statements from a corpus to create false variations to test models on.- The paper leverages recent advances in using large language models like InstructGPT for high quality dataset creation. Other recent work has shown the potential for using LLMs to create evaluations, but this paper specifically applies it for factuality evaluation by creating contrastive examples.- The study evaluates models on two new benchmark datasets created with the FACTOR approach: Wiki-FACTOR based on Wikipedia and News-FACTOR based on news articles. Other benchmark datasets for factuality tend to focus on more static fact-based knowledge.- The paper shows FACTOR correlates with but can give different results from perplexity, which is commonly used to evaluate language models. The results suggest FACTOR may better measure factuality specifically.- The human evaluation of open-ended generation provides evidence that FACTOR correlates with models' factual accuracy in free generation, validating it as a proxy metric. Other work has typically only evaluated models in closed settings.So in summary, the key novelties are proposing the FACTOR approach itself, applying it to create distinct benchmarks suited for factuality, and conducting experiments that validate FACTOR as a metric relevant for language model factuality in generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several future research directions:- Developing more sophisticated methods for generating non-factual completions, to further improve the diversity and difficulty of benchmarks created with FACTOR. They suggest this could involve leveraging recent advances in controllable text generation.- Applying FACTOR to additional domains beyond Wikipedia and news articles, to get a broader picture of models' factual capabilities across different knowledge types.- Exploring different retriever models and reranking methods in the context of retrieval-augmented LMs, to further optimize the factual grounding potential of retrieval.- Developing specialized metrics beyond accuracy for measuring specific phenomena related to factuality, like consistency and coverage of facts.- Pairing FACTOR evaluation with analysis methods to better understand model capabilities and gain insight into how to improve factuality.- Exploring the use of FACTOR for semi-supervised factual fine-tuning of LMs by generating training data.- Comparing FACTOR with other complementary methods like human evaluations and scoring sampled generations, to better understand the tradeoffs of different factuality evaluation approaches.In summary, they highlight opportunities to enhance the benchmark creation itself, apply it more broadly, optimize retrieval integration, develop richer evaluation capabilities, and leverage the benchmarks for gaining insight and improving models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces FACTOR, a new method for evaluating the factuality of language models (LMs) in generation. FACTOR transforms a factual corpus into a benchmark by automatically perturbing factual statements to create false variations. For each true statement from the corpus, FACTOR generates 3 non-factual variations representing different error types. The LM's FACTOR score is the percentage of examples where it assigns greater likelihood to the original factual statement than the non-factual alternatives. The authors apply FACTOR to Wikipedia and news articles to create Wiki-FACTOR and News-FACTOR. Experiments with large LMs show FACTOR scores increase with model size and improve when augmented with retrieval, directly demonstrating factuality gains from retrieval. FACTOR correlates with perplexity but can induce different model rankings, and aligns better with human annotations of factuality in open-ended generation. Overall, FACTOR provides a scalable new metric for evaluating and comparing LMs' factual capabilities within a domain.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces FACTOR, a new method for evaluating the factual accuracy of language models (LMs) in text generation. FACTOR automatically transforms a factual corpus into a benchmark that tests the LM's ability to assign higher likelihood to factual statements versus similar but incorrect variations. The key idea is to take factual sentences from a corpus, and use an instructed LM to generate three non-factual variations for each, perturbing different aspects like entities, predicates, etc. The resulting benchmark, with a factual/non-factual multiple choice task for each example, measures how well the LM prefers the original fact. The authors apply FACTOR to Wikipedia and news articles, creating Wiki-FACTOR and News-FACTOR. Experiments with large LMs show FACTOR scores increase with model size and improve when augmented with retrieval, demonstrating it as a novel automatic metric of factuality. Comparisons to perplexity reveal FACTOR provides complementary information. Human annotations also link higher FACTOR accuracy to more factual open-ended generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a new approach called FACTOR (Factual Assessment via Corpus TransfORmation) for evaluating the factuality of language models (LMs). The key idea is to take an evaluation corpus of interest and automatically transform it into a benchmark that tests the LM's ability to assign higher likelihood to factual statements versus similar but incorrect variations. Specifically, for each factual statement from the corpus, the method generates three non-factual variations by making minimal edits according to a typology of factual errors (e.g. modifying an entity, predicate, etc). This results in quadruples of a prefix text, factual completion, and three non-factual completions. The LM is evaluated by the percentage of examples where it assigns the highest likelihood to the factual completion over all the non-factual alternatives. The authors apply this method to Wikipedia and news articles to create two new benchmarks, Wiki-FACTOR and News-FACTOR. They use these to evaluate various LMs and show the approach can effectively measure improvements in factual generation ability with increasing model size and retrieval augmentation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of evaluating the factual accuracy of language models during open-ended text generation. Some key points:- Existing methods test factual knowledge of models by evaluating their performance on static fact datasets or question answering benchmarks. However, these methods test facts in isolation and don't directly measure a model's tendency to generate factual text. - Recent methods directly evaluate factual accuracy of sampled model generations. However, sampling biases evaluation towards common facts, and provides little control over which facts are tested.- This paper proposes FACTOR, a new method to evaluate factual generation by perturbing factual statements from a corpus into non-factual variations. Models are tested on their ability to distinguish factual vs non-factual variants. - FACTOR creates controlled test sets that uniformly evaluate a model's grasp of factual information in a corpus, regardless of likelihood. It provides a direct measure of a model's propensity to generate factual text in a domain.- Experiments show FACTOR correlates with but provides complementary information to perplexity. Human evaluation confirms it predicts factuality in open-ended generation better than perplexity alone.In summary, the key question is how to directly evaluate a model's factual accuracy in open-ended generation in a controlled, uniform way. FACTOR is proposed as a novel method to address this question.
