# [A Study of Vulnerability Repair in JavaScript Programs with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard for automatically finding and fixing security vulnerabilities in JavaScript code. JavaScript is widely used in web development but writing secure code is challenging, leading to many vulnerabilities. LLMs show promise in automated code generation and bug fixing based on specifications. 

The paper aims to answer two key research questions:

1) How accurate are LLMs at finding and fixing JavaScript vulnerabilities?

2) How does the amount of context provided in the prompt impact the effectiveness of the LLMs in producing correct patches?

The authors select 20 common weaknesses from the CWE Top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses that are relevant to JavaScript. They design 3 prompt templates with increasing levels of context about the vulnerability - context-free, context-sensitive, and context-rich. 

In total, 60 prompts are created covering the 20 vulnerabilities across the 3 templates. These prompts are provided to ChatGPT and Bard and their responses are evaluated. The key findings are:

- ChatGPT accurately patched 71.66% and Bard patched 68.33% of the cases on average. This shows promise for using LLMs in automated JavaScript vulnerability repair.

- More context in prompts leads to increased accuracy - up to 55% improvement. Context-rich prompts lead to 95% and 85% accuracy for ChatGPT and Bard respectively compared to only 40% with context-free prompts.

In summary, the study demonstrates that LLMs hold significant potential for identifying and patching JavaScript security bugs automatically. Appropriate prompts with enriched context guiding the LLMs are key to enabling higher effectiveness.
