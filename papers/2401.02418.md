# [Learning to Prompt with Text Only Supervision for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02418)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning to Prompt with Text Only Supervision for Vision-Language Models":

Problem:
Foundational vision-language models like CLIP show excellent generalization abilities but adapting them for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization remains challenging. Existing methods either require labeled image data for prompting/fine-tuning which is not always available, or use class-specific prompts from language models which have high engineering costs and don't transfer across classes/datasets.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new paradigm called "ProText" to learn generalized transferable prompts for CLIP using only text supervision. The key ideas are:

1) Curate text-to-text data from language models (like GPT-3) by generating class descriptions for dataset categories. 

2) Learn prompt vectors by enforcing a contextual mapping between the CLIP text feature of the class name template (e.g. "a photo of a dog") and the text feature of the richer class description from GPT-3. This allows prompts to embed contextual knowledge.

3) Since prompts are learned in the embedding space, they readily transfer to new classes and datasets. This reduces the need to generate custom prompts per dataset.

Main Contributions:

- First work to learn generalized prompts for CLIP using only text supervision without any images
- Developed a contextual mapping based training approach to enable prompt learning from text-to-text data  
- Learned prompts transfer seamlessly to unseen classes and datasets, cutting the language model usage cost
- Extensive experiments show the method matches or exceeds previous image-supervised and LM-ensembling methods

The key advantage is that it improves CLIP's generalization like other methods, but without needing any labeled images. The transferred prompts also avoid the high cost of generating custom prompts per dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel method called ProText to improve the generalization of vision-language models like CLIP by learning transferable prompts using only text supervision from language models, without requiring any labeled image data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called ProText for learning prompt vectors to adapt vision-language models like CLIP using only text supervision. Specifically:

- ProText learns prompt vectors by mapping template features from class names to richer template features from LLM-generated descriptions, allowing the prompts to capture contextual knowledge without using any labeled images.

- Since the prompts are learned fully in the text domain, they can transfer well to new unseen classes and datasets, reducing the need to generate new LLM prompts per dataset.

- Extensive experiments show ProText improves CLIP's generalization and achieves competitive performance to image-supervised prompt learning methods on various benchmarks, despite not using any visual supervision.

So in summary, the key novelty is learning generalized prompt vectors for vision models using just text data, which removes the reliance on labeled images while improving model transferability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes learning prompts using only text supervision from language models. What is the key motivation behind this approach compared to existing methods that use image supervision or no supervision?

2. The contextual mapping training objective is a core component of the proposed method. Explain what this mapping does and why it is important for learning effective and transferable prompts. 

3. The learned prompts are shown to transfer well to unseen classes and datasets. What properties of the prompts allow them to generalize in this way?

4. The method relies on generating descriptive text of classes using language models. What is the rationale behind using multiple descriptive captions per class rather than a single description?
