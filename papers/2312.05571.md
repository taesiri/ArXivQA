# [Frugal LMs Trained to Invoke Symbolic Solvers Achieve   Parameter-Efficient Arithmetic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit mathematical reasoning abilities, but this requires exorbitantly large models with billions of parameters. 
- Smaller LMs struggle with multi-step reasoning for math word problems.
- Fully finetuning smaller LMs for math reasoning leads to loss of generalizability and is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SYReLM, which uses a small frozen LM with a lightweight adapter module. 
- The LM acts as a translator to map natural language math questions into a formal language (FL) description that is executed by a symbolic solver to get the answer.
- Use policy gradient reinforcement learning to train the adapter module, with rewards based on correctness of the symbolic solver's output and coverage of variables from the original question.

Key Contributions:
- Shows that much smaller LMs can achieve strong arithmetic reasoning performance when posed as a formalize-then-solve task instead of entirely reasoning within the LM.
- Adapter-based finetuning provides parameter efficiency compared to full finetuning of small LMs.
- Reinforcement learning with a reasoning-specific reward function enables the model to learn better generalizability across diverse reasoning steps.  
- Achieves large performance gains over base LMs and recent methods like Toolformer, while keeping the setup interpretable and accessible.
- Establishes the validity of applying grade-school pedagogical principles to teaching AI models.

The key insight is to detach linguistic, analytical and logical processing into an LM, formal solver and symbolic solver, while using an adapter-based approach to enable smaller LMs to achieve strong arithmetic reasoning. This shows promise for frugal LMs compared to large opaque LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes SYRELM, a system where a small frozen language model equipped with a low-rank adapter acts as a translator to map natural language arithmetic questions into a formal language description, which is then executed by a symbolic solver to obtain the answer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a system called SYRELM that uses a small frozen language model equipped with a low-rank adapter to translate natural language arithmetic word problems into a formal language expression. This expression is then evaluated by a symbolic solver to obtain the answer. The key benefits highlighted are:

1) Much smaller LMs can achieve reasonable arithmetic reasoning capability by posing word problems as a formalize-then-solve task rather than relying solely on the LM's reasoning skills. 

2) The system is more interpretable and diagnosable compared to large opaque LMs folding diverse skills into themselves.

3) The setup is easy to train and experiment with, within reach for most researchers, compared to gigantic LMs.

4) The method shows massive improvements over base LMs on arithmetic reasoning datasets while keeping the above benefits. For example, on the SVAMP dataset, GPT-J 6B improved by over 30 absolute points in accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient method to impart better arithmetic reasoning skills to small LMs by integrating symbolic solvers, with empirical demonstrations of strong performance gains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a symbolic solver along with an LM for arithmetic reasoning. What are the key advantages and limitations of using a symbolic solver compared to having the LM perform all reasoning steps?

2. The paper uses policy gradient reinforcement learning to train the LM adapter. What are the challenges in designing an effective reward function for this setup? How does the proposed reward function address these challenges? 

3. The paper shows significant gains from using the proposed method with smaller LMs like GPT-J. What modifications would be needed to apply this method to much larger LLMs? Would all components still be necessary?

4. The parser used for the pseudocode language is quite simple. Could more complex parsers enable more sophisticated reasoning chains for smaller LMs? What would be some ways to design such parsers?

5. Could the formal language expression design be improved to better capture complex, multi-step reasoning chains? What enhancements could make the translations more robust?

6. Error analysis shows syntax errors are still common. What could be done during training or inference to reduce such errors?

7. How sensitive is the performance to the choice of reward functions and hyperparameters during PPO training? What analyses could be done to better understand this?

8. The paper focuses on arithmetic reasoning. How could the approach be extended to other structured reasoning domains like logic, calculus or geometry?

9. What kinds of datasets would be most useful to create to further analyze generalization capability across diverse reasoning complexity?

10. The model still struggles with longer reasoning chains. Are there alternative training strategies better suited to improving performance in such cases?
