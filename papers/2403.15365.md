# [A Transfer Attack to Image Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Watermarks have been proposed to detect AI-generated images. Prior work has shown that watermark-based detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks in white-box and black-box settings. However, their vulnerability in the no-box setting is less understood.

- In the no-box setting, the attacker does not have access to the target watermarking model or detection API. Prior transfer attacks in this setting achieve limited success. Thus, there is a belief that watermarks are robust in the no-box setting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new transfer attack using multiple surrogate watermarking models to evade watermark-based AI image detection in the no-box setting.

- The attack has two main steps:
   1) Select a target watermark for each surrogate model, e.g., inverse of the watermark it decodes.
   2) Find a perturbation by ensembling multiple surrogate models, specifically by optimizing an objective function under constraints based on surrogate models.

- Compared to prior transfer attacks, the proposed attack is tailored for watermark-based detection by leveraging surrogate watermarking models.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new ensemble-based transfer attack using multiple surrogate watermarking models to evade watermark-based AI image detection.

- Provides theoretical analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

- Empirically evaluates the attack under different target watermarking models and shows it successfully evades state-of-the-art watermarking methods, outperforming prior attacks.

- Concludes that watermark-based AI image detection is not robust to transfer attacks in the no-box threat model, invalidating prior belief.
