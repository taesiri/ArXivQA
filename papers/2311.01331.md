# [Offline Imitation from Observation via Primal Wasserstein State   Occupancy Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01331)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE), a novel method for offline imitation learning from observations (LfO). In LfO, the learner has access to expert state-only trajectories as well as unlabeled state-action pairs. PW-DICE minimizes the primal Wasserstein distance between the learner's and expert's state occupancies. Compared to prior work based on f-divergences like KL divergence, using the primal Wasserstein distance allows more flexibility in choosing the underlying distance metric. To enable practical optimization, the authors add pessimistic regularizers based on f-divergences. The resulting convex optimization problem over Lagrange multipliers yields a weighted behavior cloning objective for policy learning, with state weights determined by the multipliers. A key advantage of PW-DICE is the ability to learn the distance metric used in the Wasserstein objective via contrastive learning on the unlabeled data. Experiments across tabular and continuous control tasks demonstrate improved performance over the state-of-the-art. Theoretically, the authors prove their method generalizes a prior f-divergence approach called SMODICE. Thus, PW-DICE provides a unified framework for distribution matching based on either f-divergences or Wasserstein distance in offline LfO.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE), a new method for offline imitation learning from observations (LfO). PW-DICE minimizes the primal Wasserstein distance between the state occupancy distributions of the expert and the learner policy, allowing for more flexibility in the choice of underlying distance metric compared to prior work. Specifically, PW-DICE uses a weighted combination of a learned embedding distance from contrastive learning and a reward function based on state visitation ratios. With the addition of a pessimistic regularizer, PW-DICE converts the primal Wasserstein optimization problem into an unconstrained convex optimization problem in the Lagrange dual space. The learner's policy is then obtained by weighted behavior cloning using the Lagrange multipliers. Theoretically, PW-DICE generalizes state-of-the-art LfO methods like SMODICE and unifies $f$-divergence and Wasserstein minimization objectives. Empirically, PW-DICE outperforms several baselines on tabular and Mujoco environments. The flexible distance metric in PW-DICE is shown to be crucial to performance gains.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE) for offline imitation learning from observations, which minimizes the primal Wasserstein distance between the expert's and learner's state occupancies using a flexible contrastively learned distance metric and provides better performance than prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the question of how to effectively perform offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) by matching the state occupancy distributions of the learner and expert policies. The central hypothesis is that minimizing the primal Wasserstein distance between the learner's and expert's state occupancies, with an arbitrarily chosen distance metric, will enable more effective offline LfO compared to prior methods.

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE) to address the limitations of prior DICE methods that rely on f-divergences or the Rubinstein duality form of Wasserstein distance. PW-DICE optimizes the primal Wasserstein distance directly, with the flexibility to use any distance metric rather than being constrained to Euclidean distance. The central hypothesis is that this will improve performance over methods like SMODICE and LobsDICE by better matching the learner's and expert's state visitation distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel offline learning from observations (LfO) method called Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE), which optimizes the primal form of the Wasserstein distance between the learner's and expert's state occupancies. This provides more flexibility in choosing the underlying distance metric compared to prior work. 

2) Theoretically proving that PW-DICE is a generalization of the state-of-the-art SMODICE method. Thus it provides a unified framework for Wasserstein-based and $f$-divergence based DICE methods.

3) Empirically showing that PW-DICE achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods on multiple offline LfO testbeds including tabular and Mujoco environments.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a more flexible and better performing primal Wasserstein DICE method for offline learning from observations, with theoretical analysis and empirical validation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a new method called Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE) for offline imitation learning from observations (LfO). Here is a summary of how it compares to prior work:

1) It builds on the idea of distribution correction estimation (DICE) methods like SMODICE and LobsDICE which minimize the divergence between the learner's and expert's state/state-pair occupancy distributions. However, those use $f$-divergences while PW-DICE uses the primal Wasserstein distance, allowing more flexibility in the choice of underlying distance metric. 

2) Compared to the one prior DICE method using Wasserstein distance (SoftDICE), PW-DICE uses the primal form instead of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality. This removes the limitation that the metric must be Euclidean. PW-DICE shows empirically that the choice of metric significantly impacts performance.

3) Theoretically, it is proven that PW-DICE generalizes SMODICE, unifying $f$-divergence and Wasserstein minimization under one framework. With certain parameter choices, the PW-DICE objective reduces to SMODICE.

4) Empirically, PW-DICE achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods like SMODICE, LobsDICE, etc. on multiple testbeds. This demonstrates the benefits of using primal Wasserstein distance and a flexible learned metric.

In summary, PW-DICE advances the state-of-the-art in offline LfO by improving the flexibility of Wasserstein DICE methods regarding the choice of divergence and distance metric. It provides a unified perspective connecting $f$-divergence and Wasserstein objectives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest looking into finding a more robust formulation for their method while maintaining its good properties as a potential future research direction. Specifically, they state:

"One of the future directions is to find a more robust formulation while maintaining the good properties of PW-DICE. Thus, one of the future directions is to find a more robust formulation while maintaining the good properties of PW-DICE."

They note that in order to get an unconstrained optimization formulation, they had to add KL terms to their objective which introduced logsumexp. Some prior work has argued that logsumexp can bring instability to optimization, especially in more complex environments. So the authors suggest investigating alternate formulations that retain the strengths of their primal Wasserstein DICE method but with perhaps more stable optimization objectives.
