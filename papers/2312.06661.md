# [UpFusion: Novel View Diffusion from Unposed Sparse View Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06661)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes UpFusion, a novel approach for performing sparse-view 3D inference and novel view synthesis from unposed images. Unlike prior methods that rely on known camera poses, UpFusion incorporates the input views as context in a conditional generative model to implicitly leverage multi-view information. Specifically, it encodes the input images into a set-level representation which provides instance-specific conditioning for a diffusion model trained to generate novel views based on query-view aligned features from a scene-level transformer. This allows synthesizing high-fidelity renderings while improving quality with additional context views, despite not having explicit pose supervision. To obtain a 3D consistent representation, UpFusion further distills neural radiance fields that best explain the rendered views under the learned generative model. Experiments on Co3D and GSO datasets demonstrate improved performance over pose-reliant baselines as well as competitive results compared to state-of-the-art single image 3D inference techniques. Moreover, UpFusion shows the ability to generalize to unseen categories and even self-captured in-the-wild images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 UpFusion learns to generate high-fidelity novel views and 3D representations from sparse unposed images by conditioning a diffusion model on view-aligned features from a transformer and allowing direct attention to input view tokens.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing UpFusion, a system that can perform novel view synthesis and infer 3D representations for an object given a sparse set of reference images without corresponding pose information. Specifically:

- UpFusion introduces a mechanism to implicitly leverage available unposed images as context in a conditional generative model for synthesizing novel views. It does this via a scene-level transformer to compute query-view aligned features and intermediate attentional layers that can directly observe input image tokens.

- UpFusion adapts a pre-trained 2D foundation diffusion model to incorporate the two forms of context-based conditioning for novel view synthesis. This allows it to generalize beyond the training categories.

- UpFusion extracts 3D-consistent representations from the synthesized novel views using score-based distillation into a neural radiance field. This allows obtaining a consistent 3D model.

- Experiments on the Co3D and GSO datasets demonstrate UpFusion's ability to effectively utilize information from additional unposed views for improving performance. It also shows improved performance over pose-reliant baselines as well as single-view methods.

In summary, the key contribution is a system for sparse-view 3D inference without relying on explicit pose information by instead conditioning novel view synthesis on available images.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Unposed sparse views - The paper focuses on performing 3D inference and novel view synthesis given a sparse set of input images without associated camera poses.

- Scene-level transformer - The method leverages a transformer model called UpSRT that can reason about a scene from unposed images and generate view-aligned features.

- Conditional diffusion models - The core of the approach is training a conditional variational diffusion model that can generate high fidelity novel views conditioned on the view-aligned features from the transformer. 

- Score-based distillation - To obtain a 3D consistent representation from the generated novel views, the method distills an implicit neural scene representation using techniques based on score matching.

- Co3Dv2 dataset - One of the main datasets used for evaluation, comprising real images of objects captured under varying viewpoints.

- Generalization - The method demonstrates an ability to generalize to unseen categories and even perform reconstruction from images of more general in-the-wild objects.

In summary, the key ideas involve using transformers and diffusion models for unposed view synthesis and leveraging score distillation to obtain consistent 3D representations. The method is evaluated on challenging real image datasets and shows generalization capabilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two complementary forms of conditioning the diffusion model on context from input views - via query-aligned features from the UpSRT decoder and via direct attention to input view features. What are the relative benefits and limitations of each of these conditioning mechanisms?

2. The paper demonstrates improved performance from additional context views. However, the improvements seem modest compared to pose-aware sparse view methods that can explicitly leverage geometric correspondences. What architectural or objective modifications could help better exploit additional views?

3. The paper argues that explicit pose estimation may not be reliable for in-the-wild 3D inference. But recent works have shown impressive pose estimation performance even from sparse views. Could pose-based aggregation still be beneficial if robust pose estimation is available?

4. The method seems to generalize well to unseen categories. What inductive biases enable this generalization capability? Is the pre-training on large 2D datasets crucial for this?

5. The paper extracts 3D representations via optimizing the likelihood of renderings under the learned generative model. How sensitive is this neural 3D optimization to the quality and diversity of the rendered images?

6. Can the proposed unposed view synthesis approach be extended to video inputs instead of images? What challenges need to be addressed to enable consistent novel view synthesis from unposed video?

7. The method has only been demonstrated on object-centric datasets. What complications can arise when applying it to general scenes with complex backgrounds and occlusions?

8. What mechanisms in the model architecture encourage compositionality and disentanglement of shape/appearance/pose to enable generalization?

9. How does the sample efficiency compare against pose-based methods? Could the model be trained with fewer images by using better regularization techniques?

10. The model struggles with geometry outside the convex hull of input views. Can ideas from single image novel view synthesis be combined to hallucinate complete shapes?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the challenging problem of recovering 3D representations from sparse images captured in-the-wild where camera poses are not available. Most existing works rely on multi-view geometry techniques like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) that require known poses, and hence fail in such in-the-wild settings. On the other hand, single-view 3D inference is ill-posed and cannot leverage additional views for reconstruction.

Proposed Solution: UpFusion
The paper proposes UpFusion, a learning-based system that can effectively use unposed sparse views of an object to synthesize novel views as well as infer a 3D-consistent representation. UpFusion has three key components:

1) Unposed Scene Representation Transformer (UpSRT): Encodes input unposed images into a set-latent vector and can be queried using a target viewpoint to obtain view-aligned decoder features. 

2) Conditional Diffusion Model: Given the view-aligned features and set latent vector from UpSRT as conditioning, it is trained to denoise and generate high-fidelity novel views. This provides an implicit understanding of object geometry.

3) 3D Distillation: An instance-specific neural radiance field representation is optimized to match the renderings from the diffusion model using a score matching loss. This yields an explicit 3D representation.


The paper proposes two complementary forms of conditioning in the diffusion model: a) via the view-aligned features, and b) via intermediate attention layers that allow directly observing input image features.

Contributions:
1) A framework for 3D inference from sparse unposed views that does not rely on explicit pose estimation techniques.

2) A novel conditioning scheme for diffusion models that combines pose-aligned features and direct attention for effective view generation. 

3) Evaluation on Co3D and GSO datasets demonstrates improved performance over state-of-the-art pose-based and single-view methods, especially with more views.

4) Demonstrates generalization capability to unseen object categories as well as self-captured casual images.
