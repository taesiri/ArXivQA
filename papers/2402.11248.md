# [CoLLaVO: Crayon Large Language and Vision mOdel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11248)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Current vision language models (VLMs) have not been analyzed in depth regarding their object-level image understanding capabilities and how this influences their performance on vision-language (VL) tasks. 
- Experiments reveal VLMs still struggle with comprehending images at a fine-grained object level for some categories. 
- There exists a strong correlation between VLMs' object-level understanding and their zero-shot VL performance. Enhancing the former is crucial for improving the latter.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce Crayon Prompt - a new visual prompt based on panoptic color maps providing semantic and numbering information about objects.
- Crayon Prompt Tuning (CPT) aligns prompts with backbone VLM using simple crayon instructions.  
- Crayon Prompt-based Instruction Tuning (CIT) fuses CPT with visual instruction datasets using Dual QLoRA - efficiently preserving both object-level and complex VL capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Reveal intriguing property of current VLMs - object-level image understanding strongly tied to zero-shot VL performance.
- Propose Crayon Prompt and Dual QLoRA to enhance object understanding and maintain it alongside VL capabilities.
- Present efficient model CoLLaVO-7B, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot VL performance compared to both closed-source and open-source VLMs by improving object-level understanding.

In summary, this paper provides valuable analysis highlighting the importance of foundational image understanding in VLMs and introduces effective techniques to boost it, culminating in the state-of-the-art CoLLaVO model.
