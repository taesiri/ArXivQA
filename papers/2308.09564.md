# [Deep Equilibrium Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new query-based object detector called DEQDet. 

The central hypothesis is that modeling the query refinement process in object detection as an infinite fixed point solving of an implicit layer can improve both parameter efficiency and modeling capacity. 

Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:

1) How to formulate the object query refinement process as an infinite fixed point solving of an implicit layer (termed deep equilibrium decoder)? 

2) How to effectively train this implicit decoder layer to inject "refinement awareness", given that standard methods like JFB lack this property?

3) Whether this DEQDet framework can achieve better performance than baseline methods like AdaMixer in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and memory efficiency?

4) How to design the overall DEQDet architecture and training strategy to stabilize training and improve generalization?

In summary, the paper introduces a new perspective on modeling query-based detectors using deep equilibrium models and proposes techniques like Refinement-Aware Gradient (RAG) and Refinement-Aware Perturbation (RAP) to address the training challenges. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, faster convergence, and reduced memory consumption compared to AdaMixer baseline.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new object detector called DEQDet based on deep equilibrium modeling. The main contributions are:

1. It introduces an RNN perspective on query-based object detectors, revealing their refinement nature. It then models the refinement process as the fixed point solving of an implicit layer, allowing infinite refinement steps.

2. It proposes two techniques called Refinement Aware Gradient (RAG) and Refinement Aware Perturbation (RAP) to inject refinement awareness into the training of DEQDet. RAG uses higher order terms to capture gradient propagation along the refinement path. RAP perturbs the fixed point solving path to simulate real noise.

3. Experiments show DEQDet achieves better performance than baselines like AdaMixer, with faster convergence, lower memory usage, and better scaling to stronger backbones. On COCO it obtains 49.5 mAP using ResNet-50 under standard 2x schedule.

4. It provides a general deep equilibrium modeling framework that could be applied to other query-based detectors. The implicit modeling offers benefits like parameter efficiency and infinite refinement.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DEQDet which models query-based detection as an equilibrium solving process and achieves improved performance. The equilibrium view provides a new modeling perspective and optimization techniques like RAG and RAP are introduced for effective training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new query-based object detector called DEQDet that uses a deep equilibrium decoder to model query refinement as an infinite fixed point solving process of an implicit layer, achieving better performance than previous methods like AdaMixer with improved convergence, lower memory usage, and refinement awareness from proposed techniques like refinement-aware gradients.

In short, the paper introduces a new object detector using an implicit deep equilibrium model for infinite query refinement that outperforms prior work.
