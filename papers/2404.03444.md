# [Simultaneous State Estimation and Contact Detection for Legged Robots by   Multiple-Model Kalman Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate state estimation and contact detection are crucial for control of legged robots, especially when operating in unstructured environments. However, adding sensors like cameras or force sensors increases cost and failure risk. This paper aims to develop a software-based solution that only relies on commonly available proprioceptive sensors like inertial measurement units (IMUs) and motor encoders.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM-KF) that jointly estimates the robot state and detects contacts by reasoning about the dynamics. The robot motion is modeled as a switched system with different modes relating to different feet contacts. Each KF mode uses "hypothetical" contact forces and binary contact variables to model if a foot contact is active or not. By estimating the state and these contact variables, the algorithm can detect contacts and improve state estimation. It uses IMU and motor sensors, and also generates "pseudo-measurements" of velocity and position when contacts are detected. Physical constraints on contact forces are used to bias mode probabilities.

Contributions:
- Physics-based switched model relating contacts to dynamics 
- Simultaneous contact detection and state estimation using IMM-KF
- Pseudo-measurements for velocity and position exploiting contacts
- Biasing of mode probabilities using physical constraints 
- Improved state estimate accuracy in simulation (2.5x lower RMSE than baseline)
- Real-time contact detection (<20ms) demonstrated on hardware

In summary, the paper presents a model-based IMM-KF for joint contact detection and state estimation on legged robots using only proprioceptive sensors. This enhances state estimation through contact exploitation and enables rapid contact detection for reactive control. Key novelties are the integrated estimation framework, use of pseudo-measurements, and physics-based probability biasing.
