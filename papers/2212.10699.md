# [PaletteNeRF: Palette-based Appearance Editing of Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10699)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we efficiently edit the appearance of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in an intuitive and photorealistic manner while maintaining 3D consistency? 

The key hypotheses are:

1) The appearance of a NeRF scene can be decomposed into a combination of palette-based color bases that are shared across the scene. 

2) Jointly optimizing the color bases and spatially-varying blending weights can achieve a meaningful decomposition that supports editing by modifying the color palettes.

3) Regularizers can encourage spatial coherence and sparsity in the decomposition to get better results.

4) Incorporating semantic features can enable localized editing of objects.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework called PaletteNeRF that decomposes a NeRF into intuitive palette-based representations to enable efficient and controllable appearance editing like recoloring and stylization while maintaining photorealism and 3D consistency.
