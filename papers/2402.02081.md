# [Risk-Sensitive Diffusion: Learning the Underlying Distribution from   Noisy Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02081)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models like DDPM and score-based models have shown remarkable performance for generative modeling and image synthesis. However, they are fragile when the training data contains noisy/corrupted samples, which limits their applicability to many real-world settings where clean data is uncommon. 

- Simply discarding noisy samples results in loss of information. Conditional diffusion models that try to avoid generating noisy samples fail to fully utilize the useful information present in those samples.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a risk-sensitive stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that leverages available risk/noise information to robustly optimize diffusion models on noisy datasets. 

- Key insight is that mismatch between noisy and clean sample distributions during diffusion process misguides model optimization. The proposed risk-sensitive SDE adjusts distributions of noisy samples to match clean ones for some initial timesteps (stability interval), decreasing this misguidance.

- Closed form solutions derived for optimal risk-sensitive SDE coefficients for Gaussian noise and general noise distributions that provably minimize negative impact of noisy samples.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptually pioneers incorporation of risk information into diffusion model training, enabling robust optimization on noisy data.

- Derives parameterized risk-sensitive SDE solutions for Gaussian and non-Gaussian perturbations that guarantee maximal stability intervals and least misguidance from noisy samples.

- Empirically demonstrates on synthetic and real datasets from medical time series and tabular domains that the proposed approach can accurately recover clean data distribution from noisy inputs, significantly outperforming baselines.

In summary, the paper makes diffusion models applicable to the practical noisy data regime by developing a principled risk-sensitive SDE framework that provably exploits useful information from noisy samples while mitigating their negative impacts. Both theoretical analysis and experiments validate the efficacy of their solution.
