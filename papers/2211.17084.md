# [High-Fidelity Guided Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17084)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we perform high-fidelity guided image synthesis from user scribbles using latent diffusion models, without requiring paired training data or modifications to model architecture/training?

Specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Existing inversion-based approaches for guided synthesis with diffusion models suffer from an intrinsic domain gap problem, resulting in outputs that lack details and resemble simplistic representations. 

2) Modelling the guided synthesis output as the solution to a constrained optimization problem can help resolve this domain gap issue and achieve highly realistic outputs in a single diffusion sampling pass.

3) An approximate solution to this constrained optimization can be obtained through simple gradient descent, by minimizing the distance between the painted image and reference scribbles, while regularizing the output to lie close to the text-conditioned sample space.

4) Defining cross-attention based correspondence between text tokens and scribble regions allows controlling semantics without conditional training.

The paper aims to validate these hypotheses through proposed methods GradOP and GradOP+, along with qualitative and quantitative experiments on guided image synthesis from text prompts and user scribbles. The key novelty lies in formulating and approximately solving the optimization problem to bridge domain gap without modifying model training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new guided image synthesis framework using latent diffusion models. The key ideas are:

1. They formulate guided image synthesis as a constrained optimization problem, where the goal is to generate an image that is faithful to the user's strokes while also being realistic according to the text prompt. 

2. They propose an approximate optimization method called GradOP to efficiently solve this problem with gradient descent during a single reverse diffusion sampling pass. 

3. They allow controlling the semantics of different painted regions through a cross-attention mechanism between text tokens and stroke regions, without needing segmentation maps.

4. Their method achieves significantly improved photorealism, faithfulness to strokes, and user controllability compared to prior inversion-based guided diffusion techniques like SDEdit.

In summary, the key novelty is the formulation as a constrained optimization problem to address the domain gap issue in inversion-based approaches, along with an efficient GradOP approximation and cross-attention semantic control. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art guided image synthesis results in terms of photorealism, faithfulness, and user satisfaction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new stroke based guided image synthesis framework that resolves the domain shift problem in prior works, generates high-fidelity outputs with a single diffusion pass, and enables control over semantic regions using cross-attention without extra training.
