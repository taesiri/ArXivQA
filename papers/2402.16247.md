# [Learning Translations: Emergent Communication Pretraining for   Cooperative Language Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling artificial agents to communicate and cooperate effectively with new partners they have not encountered before, without additional training. Typically in emergent communication research, agents develop communication protocols specialized to their training partners. However, these protocols fail when interacting with new agents. The paper proposes a new problem called "Cooperative Language Acquisition" where an agent must learn to communicate with a target community of agents by observing their previous interactions.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors introduce two methods for an agent ("joiner") to acquire the communication protocol of a target agent community:

1. Imitation Learning (IL): The joiner is trained via supervision to imitate the messaging behavior of the agents.

2. Emergent Communication pretraining and Translation Learning (ECTL): First, a separate set of agents are trained from scratch to communicate via an emergent protocol. The joiner is initialized from one of these pretrained agents. It then learns mapping functions to translate between its emergent protocol and the target community's protocol using the interaction dataset.

The joiner is evaluated on its ability to replace a member of the target community and communicate effectively on its first encounter.

Main Contributions:

- Formalizes the "Cooperative Language Acquisition Problem" (CLAP) where an agent must acquire the communication conventions of a target community it will cooperate with.

- Proposes two methods (IL and ECTL) for an agent to solve the CLAP challenge. 

- Empirically compares IL and ECTL on two multi-agent cooperation environments, showing ECTL is more robust when community data is limited or biased.

- Demonstrates ECTL enables an agent to successfully communicate with a human user on a cooperative navigation task by translating the user's instructions.
