# [Two-stage Rainfall-Forecasting Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12779)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current deep learning models for rainfall forecasting have limitations in accuracy, especially for long-term forecasts. They tend to predict average rainfall rather than actual rainfall patterns, resulting in blurry generated images and incorrect spatial positions.

Proposed Solution: 
- A Two-stage Rainfall-Forecasting Diffusion Model (TRDM) is proposed to improve accuracy of long-term rainfall prediction and balance performance between temporal and spatial modeling.

- Stage 1 (Prediction Stage): Uses a 3D sequence conditional diffusion model to predict low-resolution rainfall frames for the next 80 minutes based on 20 minute input conditions. Focuses on capturing robust temporal correlations while retaining some spatial information.

- Stage 2 (Reconstruction Stage): Reconstructs the low-resolution frames into high-resolution images using two proposed super-resolution diffusion models - Spatial Super-Resolution (SSR) and Latent Super-Resolution (LSR). Focuses on enhancing spatial details and structure.

Main Contributions:

- Novel two-stage strategy with temporal diffusion model for prediction and spatial diffusion model for reconstruction to better capture complexity of rainfall variability.

- Advanced 3D sequence conditional diffusion model that accurately predicts future low-resolution rainfall sequences while retaining spatial information.

- Two proposed super-resolution methods tailored for reconstructing rainfall images - SSR operates in pixel space while LSR works in latent space.

- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated on MRMS and Swedish radar datasets, with improved long-term forecasting accuracy over existing models.

- Open-source implementation available to replicate and build upon.
