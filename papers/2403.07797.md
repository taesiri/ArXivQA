# [Joint Selection: Adaptively Incorporating Public Information for Private   Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating differentially private synthetic data is an important task that allows sensitive data to be shared while preserving privacy. Many existing methods are based on an "adaptive measurements" framework where noisy measurements are made to iteratively refine a model. However, one limitation of these methods is the inability to incorporate public data, which could potentially improve accuracy. Simply pre-training models on public data is incompatible with methods like PGM that do not fix model structure a priori.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper develops a "Joint Adaptive Measurements" (JAM) framework that expands adaptive measurements to jointly select between measuring public data and private data. This allows public data to be selectively incorporated even when model structure evolves over iterations.

Specifically, the paper develops JAM-PGM which uses graphical models in PGM to represent the data distribution. The selection step is augmented to include public and private versions of candidate queries. A score function estimates the error reduction from making each measurement. This allows the method to decide when public data can accurately proxy for private data. A "frugal budgeting" scheme rolls privacy savings over to later rounds when public data is used.

Main Contributions:
- Develops the JAM framework to incorporate public data selection into iterative methods for differentially private synthetic data 
- Introduces joint selection between public and private measurements based on an expected error reduction score
- Proposes JAM-PGM method that can leverage public data even when model structure changes across iterations
- Empirically evaluates JAM-PGM against state-of-the-art baselines on multiple datasets
- Shows improved accuracy compared to public-data assisted baselines across varying levels of public data bias

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in effectively and adaptively incorporating public data to improve differentially private synthetic data generation. The JAM framework and JAM-PGM method advance the state-of-the-art in this area.
