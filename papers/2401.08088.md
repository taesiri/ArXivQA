# [Enhancing Document-level Translation of Large Language Model via   Translation Mixed-instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on sentence-level translation instructions achieve good sentence-level translation performance. However, they struggle with document-level translation, especially for long documents (>512 tokens). 
- This is due to lack of document-to-document mapping capability as they are only trained on sentence-level instructions.
- As a result, there is a sentence-level coverage issue in document translation where only initial sentences get translated and subsequent ones remain untranslated.

Proposed Solution: 
- Combine sentence-level and document-level translation instructions of varying lengths to fine-tune LLMs. 
- Translation mixed-instructions enable LLMs to learn robust translation abilities from sentence-level to long documents (upto 2048 tokens).

Key Contributions:
- Identify weakness of lightweight LLMs in document translation and propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning approach using translation mixed-instructions.
- Show sentence-level and document-level instructions play different roles - former stimulates sentence translation while latter enhances document translation ability. Too many sentence-level instructions can harm document translation capability.  
- Extensive experiments show proposed approach significantly enhances document translation capability of Llama models on 10 language pairs, maintaining performance from sentence to 2048 token documents.
- Discourse analysis demonstrates improved translation quality on coherence phenomena like tense consistency, conjunction presence etc.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective mixed-instruction fine-tuning method to improve lightweight LLMs' document-level translation capability, analyzing the distinct roles that varying length instructions play.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes combining sentence-level and document-level translation instructions of varying lengths to fine-tune large language models, enhancing their document-level translation capabilities and overcoming issues like sentence-level coverage that limit vanilla models fine-tuned only on sentence-level data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It identifies the weakness in document-level translation of large language models (LLMs) and proposes a simple yet effective approach to enhance their performance by combining sentence-level and document-level translation instructions of varying lengths. 

2. It reveals that sentence-level and document-level translation instructions play different roles in LLMs, with the former mainly stimulating sentence-level translation ability and the latter enhancing document-level translation ability. Moreover, it finds that fine-tuning too many sentence-level translation instructions can severely harm the document-level translation ability of LLMs.

3. It conducts extensive experimental results showing that the proposed translation mixed-instructions significantly improve the document-level translation performance of LLMs on 10 language pairs, maintaining stable translation performance from sentence-level to inputs of 2048 tokens in length.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the translation mixed-instructions approach to enhance document-level translation capability of LLMs by combining instructions of varying lengths during fine-tuning.

The paper investigates enhancing the document-level translation capability of lightweight LLMs by proposing a simple yet effective fine-tuning approach using translation mixed-instructions. The key ideas explored are combining sentence-level and document-level translation instructions of varying lengths to improve translation coherence and mitigate issues like sentence-level coverage and position bias in LLMs. The approach is evaluated on multiple language pairs using both automatic metrics like BLEU and COMET as well as discourse phenomena based evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key insight behind using translation mixed-instructions to enhance document-level translation capability of lightweight LLMs? Why does fine-tuning purely on sentence-level instructions result in poor document translation ability?

2. How exactly are the translation mixed-instructions constructed in this work? What are the different types of instructions included and what role does each type play in improving translation capability? 

3. The authors find that too many sentence-level instructions can severely harm document translation ability. What is the explanation provided for this phenomenon? How can the proportion of sentence vs document level instructions be optimized?

4. This paper evaluates performance on documents up to 2048 tokens. What practical challenges need to be overcome to apply the proposed approach on even longer documents such as full articles or books? 

5. The discourse phenomena evaluation reveals that document translations improve coherence but still underperform human references. What are the remaining gaps and how can they be addressed in future work?

6. Could the translation mixed-instructions approach proposed here be applied to other language generation tasks like summarization or dialogue to reduce position bias and improve long text capability?

7. How does the performance of lightweight Llama models enhanced by this approach compare to state-of-the-art heavyweight LLMs designed specifically for translation such as GPT-3?

8. What additional analyses could provide more insight into the model behavior when trained on mixed vs pure sentence level instructions (e.g. attention analysis)?

9. How does scaling up the size of the translation mixed-instructions dataset impact overall performance? Is there a point of diminishing returns?

10. Could mixing instructions across other dimensions like formality, domain, style etc also be an effective strategy to make LLMs more versatile and reduce biases?
