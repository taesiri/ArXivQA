# [Uncertainty quantification in automated valuation models with locally   weighted conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06531)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies methods for constructing prediction intervals around machine learning models for house price prediction. The authors utilize conformal prediction (CP), which is a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework, to construct confidence sets around predictions from models like gradient boosted trees and random forests. They compare different weighting schemes for the non-conformity scores used in CP to account for spatial heterogeneity and dependence in housing data. In particular, they study a locally weighted version of CP that assigns higher weight to training observations in the geographic neighborhood of a test instance. Through a case study on housing transactions in Oslo, Norway and simulations, they demonstrate that this spatially weighted CP yields more calibrated prediction intervals across different regions of the city compared to regular CP. The locally weighted CP methods are effective at adjusting for spatial patterns in the non-conformity scores that would otherwise violate global exchangeability assumptions. This enables the construction of valid and efficient prediction intervals for house prices that properly quantify localization and adapt to geographical variability.
