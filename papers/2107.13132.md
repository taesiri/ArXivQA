# [Unsupervised Learning of Neurosymbolic Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13132)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn latent representations that are both low-dimensional and interpretable, by integrating neural networks with symbolic programs? 

Specifically, the authors propose an approach for "unsupervised neurosymbolic representation learning", where part of the latent representation is computed by a symbolic program written in a domain-specific language (DSL). This allows incorporating human expertise into the latent space. The rest of the latent variables are learned using a neural network, to maintain the model's flexibility. 

The key ideas are:

- Propose neurosymbolic encoders that produce latent codes by composing neural nets and symbolic programs. This leads to more interpretable and disentangled representations compared to purely neural approaches.

- Integrate variational autoencoders with program synthesis techniques to learn the neural network and symbolic program jointly.

- Evaluate the approach on real-world trajectory datasets from biology and sports analytics. Demonstrate improved clustering and downstream task performance compared to neural baselines.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining neural networks with symbolic programs can produce latent representations that balance interpretability and disentanglement with model flexibility. The key research questions are around developing algorithms to learn such neurosymbolic representations in an unsupervised manner, and evaluating their benefits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting a framework for unsupervised learning of neurosymbolic encoders. The key ideas are:

- Proposing neurosymbolic encoders, where part of the latent representation is produced by an interpretable encoder program written in a domain-specific language (DSL), while the rest is computed by a neural network. 

- An algorithm to learn such encoders by alternating between VAE training and program synthesis techniques. This allows incorporating symbolic knowledge while leveraging state-of-the-art tools.

- Experiments on real-world trajectory datasets from animal behavior and sports analytics that demonstrate the learned neurosymbolic representations result in more semantically meaningful clusters compared to standard VAEs.

- Showcasing the practical utility of the learned programs by integrating them into a downstream behavior analysis framework and achieving performance comparable to expert-designed programs for behavior classification.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel neurosymbolic representation learning approach along with an algorithm to realize it, and demonstrating its benefits over neural approaches for producing interpretable and meaningful representations on real-world sequential data.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for unsupervised learning of neurosymbolic encoders, which combine neural networks with symbolic programs, in order to learn more interpretable and semantically meaningful latent representations compared to purely neural approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to related work in unsupervised representation learning:

- The main novelty is the idea of learning a neurosymbolic encoder, where part of the representation is produced by a symbolic program. This differs from most prior work on unsupervised representation learning, which uses fully neural encoders like VAEs. The symbolic program component allows incorporating human knowledge and leads to more interpretable representations.

- Most prior work on learning symbolic representations has focused on the complementary problem of learning symbolic decoders or generative models. For example, some papers have looked at learning programs that can generate image or sequence data. This paper is one of the first to explore learning symbolic encoders.

- For behavior analysis domains, prior representation learning papers have used standard approaches like VAEs, forecasting models, etc. The programs learned by this paper's method can produce more semantically meaningful clusters that better match human-labeled behaviors.

- The learning algorithm integrates modern techniques like VAEs and differentiable program synthesis. So it benefits from advances in both deep latent variable models and neurosymbolic program learning.

- For preventing posterior/index collapse, this paper uses some previously studied techniques like information factorization penalties and channel capacity constraints. The focus is not on proposing new solutions here but showing how existing solutions can be integrated.

- The experiments validate the approach on real-world animal and sports trajectory datasets. Using the learned representations for downstream tasks demonstrates the practical utility. Overall the paper makes good progress towards interpretable unsupervised representation learning.

In summary, the key novelty is neurosymbolic encoders, and the paper shows promising results on applying this idea for behavior analysis. The approach nicely combines recent advances in VAEs and program synthesis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling up the approach to more complex domains like image and text data. The authors note that applying their method to images would require modifications like using convolutional VAEs and designing DSLs suitable for pixel data.

- Improving the scalability of the program search process. The current approach can become slow when learning multiple long programs. The authors suggest exploring more sophisticated search methods beyond their greedy approach.

- Exploring unsupervised approaches to learn the decoder as well. The current method requires the decoder to be a standard neural network, but incorporating recent work on unsupervised symbolic program synthesis for the decoder is an interesting direction. 

- Rigorously formulating a learning objective tailored to this neurosymbolic encoder-decoder setup. The authors note that their practical extensions to the standard VAE training objective may lead to sub-optimal likelihood, so new objectives could be designed.

- Applying the idea of neurosymbolic encoders to other domains like control systems, biomarkers, and socioeconomic data. The current work focuses on trajectory data but the overall idea could benefit other areas where human interpretability is important.

- Improving the training efficiency, uncertainty characterization, and program complexity characterization. The authors suggest these as interesting research avenues to make the approach more practical.

In summary, the main future directions are developing extensions for broader applicability, improving scalability and training efficiency, incorporating symbolic program synthesis ideas more fully, and rigorously characterizing the properties of this neurosymbolic learning framework.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework for unsupervised learning of neurosymbolic encoders. Neurosymbolic encoders combine neural networks with symbolic programs from a domain-specific language (DSL) to create latent representations that are more interpretable and factorized compared to fully neural encoders. The authors integrate variational autoencoders (VAEs) with modern program synthesis techniques in order to learn a neurosymbolic encoder along with a standard decoder. Specifically, they start with a fully neural encoder and iteratively make it more symbolic by finding programs that match the behavior of the current encoder. The discrete search through programs is enabled by recent techniques for differentiable program synthesis.  

The neurosymbolic encoders are evaluated on real-world trajectory datasets from animal behavior analysis and sports analytics. The clusters produced by the symbolic programs are shown to be more aligned with human annotations and have better separation between categories compared to standard VAE baselines. The approach is also shown to be robust to different DSL designs from domain experts. Finally, the usefulness of the learned programs is demonstrated by integrating them into a downstream self-supervised learning pipeline for behavior classification, where they perform comparably to hand-designed expert programs. The results indicate that neurosymbolic encoders can produce interpretable and useful latent representations while incorporating domain knowledge.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a framework for unsupervised learning of neurosymbolic encoders, which combine neural networks with symbolic programs from a domain-specific language (DSL) to create latent representations. The method integrates variational autoencoder (VAE) training with program synthesis techniques. It initializes a neurosymbolic encoder with a fully neural program and alternates between optimizing the VAE objective and replacing part of the neural program with a symbolic program via distillation. This gradually increases the interpretability of the encoder. The symbolic programs are learned by searching over programs in a DSL grammar using an informed search algorithm guided by neural heuristics. The method can learn multiple binary classification programs to represent more classes. It incorporates techniques like adversarial training and capacity constraints to prevent issues like posterior collapse. Experiments on trajectory datasets show it can learn interpretable programs that create more meaningful clusters corresponding to human-annotated behaviors compared to standard VAEs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing two main problems:

1. Neural network-based encoders for extracting latent representations from data can lack interpretability and fail to properly separate data into semantically meaningful categories. Standard methods like variational autoencoders (VAEs) use neural networks to map data to latent representations, but these mappings are complex and opaque.

2. Incorporating expert knowledge into representation learning can be challenging. Approaches like neurosymbolic programming aim to combine neural networks with symbolic programs, but often rely on supervised training data which can be laborious for humans to provide.

To tackle these issues, the paper presents an unsupervised learning framework to obtain neurosymbolic encoders for data like trajectories. The key ideas are:

- The encoder has a neural network component and a symbolic program component. This allows interpretability via the program while maintaining capacity via the neural network.

- The program component is represented as a differentiable program in a domain-specific language (DSL), which incorporates expert knowledge. 

- The model is trained end-to-end with a VAE-style objective, alternating between optimizing the neural components via backpropagation and searching for better symbolic programs via techniques like distillation.

- The discrete program search uses modern program synthesis methods to efficiently explore the combinatorial space.

So in summary, the paper aims to improve the interpretability and semantic meaningfulness of unsupervised representation learning, while reducing the dependence on supervised training data, by bringing in expert domain knowledge via differentiable programming. The technical contribution is a method to jointly train and search for neural and symbolic encoder components for data like trajectories.
