# [Multi-Object Navigation in real environments using hybrid policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-object navigation (Multi-ON) is a complex embodied AI task requiring an agent to sequentially navigate to multiple target objects in a specified order within a time limit.
- While progress has been made in simulation using deep reinforcement learning, transferring such policies to real world robots faces challenges due to the sim2real gap.  
- There has been little to no experimental evaluation of Multi-ON in real physical environments.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a hybrid navigation method combining classical robotics with learned components to reduce the sim2real gap.
- Metric mapping and localization is done using lidar-based SLAM. RGB observations are used for semantic object detection and mapping.
- Exploration policy is learned via RL on top of the metric map to maximize coverage and find objects. 
- Once a target object is detected, waypoints are designated to exploit and navigate to it.

Main Contributions:
- First thorough evaluation of Multi-ON in real environments using a physical Locobot robot.
- Introduction of a hybrid system combining classical robotics and learned components tailored for sim2real transfer.
- The hybrid method outperforms prior state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches in both simulated and real-world experiments.
- Analysis of exploration capability, sim2real gap reduction, and qualitative rollout visualizations.

In summary, the paper makes multi-object navigation feasible in real environments via a hybrid approach, with superior performance over end-to-end methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hybrid navigation method for the multi-object navigation task that combines classical mapping and planning with learned exploration and object detection to enable sim-to-real transfer and achieve state-of-the-art performance in real environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing a hybrid method for Multi-Object navigation that combines classical metric SLAM and path planning with learned components trained with supervised learning and RL. 

2) Reproducing the Multi-ON benchmark in a real physical environment with manufactured reproductions of the goal objects originally used in a simulated environment.

3) Comparing the proposed hybrid method to end-to-end trained methods, including the previous state-of-the-art, in both simulation and the real physical environment. The hybrid method outperforms the end-to-end methods, especially in the real environment.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a hybrid navigation method designed for better sim2real transfer, implementing the Multi-ON benchmark in a real environment for the first time, and showing the advantages of the hybrid approach compared to end-to-end methods in both simulation and the real world.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines classical algorithms and learned components. What is the motivation behind this design choice compared to end-to-end learned approaches? How does it help with sim2real transfer?

2) The exploration policy is trained with RL using a coverage reward. What is the idea behind baking in the inductive bias of predicting a spatial heatmap? How does masking and sampling waypoints from this heatmap lead to a more interpretable and multi-modal policy?

3) The paper argues that limiting the length of local planning trajectories helped stabilise RL training. Can you explain the reasoning here? How does local noise impact outer loop training?

4) Object detection and mapping is framed as a semantic segmentation task. What are the advantages of this formulation over object detection with bounding boxes? How is the alignment with the metric map performed?

5) What are the key differences between the EgoMap maintained by the agent versus a classical SLAM map? What is the motivation behind using an egocentric map?

6) The exploration policy takes the EgoMap as input instead of raw sensory observations. What is the motivation behind this design choice? How does it minimize the sim2real gap?

7) The paper evaluates performance in both simulation and real environments. What are the key differences in results between simulation and real? Why do you think the end-to-end baselines fail in real environments?

8) Can you analyze the tradeoffs between the hybrid approach proposed versus learned end-to-end models for embodied navigation? Under what conditions would an end-to-end approach be preferred?

9) The method seems to have a hand-designed high-level decision process. What are the limitations of this? How can it be made more robust?

10) What directions for future work on hybrid approaches for complex embodied AI tasks do you think are the most promising, based on the analyses in this paper?
