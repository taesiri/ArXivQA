## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Chain-of-Spot: Interactive Reasoning Improves Large Vision-Language Models":

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (LVLMs) face challenges in effectively extracting visual features tailored to diverse questions that aid language models in responding accurately. 
- Lower image resolutions are commonly used in LVLMs due to computational constraints, limiting visual recognition capabilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce "Chain-of-Spot" method for interactive reasoning that enhances LVLMs' ability to identify and focus on key regions of interest (ROIs) in images corresponding to questions.

- Redesign training and inference procedures to:
  1) Guide LVLMs to first localize pertinent ROI given a question.
  2) Present global image and zoomed-in ROI to LVLMs to generate improved responses.

- Annotate ROIs on LLaVA dataset using relevance propagation between language and visual token attentions.

- Fine-tune LLaVA models with instructions, images, and annotated ROIs.

Main Contributions:
- Propose an efficient approach to provide LVLMs access to multi-granularity visual features without compromising image resolution.
- Demonstrate significant improvements in performance of LLaVA models across 11 vision-language benchmarks including VQA, instruction following, and generative tasks.
- Establish state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, showcasing enhanced reasoning and understanding of visual concepts.
- Introduce interactive reasoning paradigm for LVLMs that mimics human perception for interpreting visual information.

In summary, "Chain-of-Spot" greatly improves LVLMs' visual reasoning abilities by directing attention to salient image regions, through an intuitive and efficient interactive approach.
