# [Negative Pre-aware for Noisy Cross-modal Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cross-modal matching aims to align images and texts in a common space to measure their similarity. It has applications in areas like image captioning and visual question answering.
- Existing datasets contain noisy correspondences between images and texts, which negatively impacts model performance. As the noise ratio increases, model performance becomes increasingly unstable.
- Existing methods rely on identifying and correcting the noisy samples, but this approach has limitations, especially with high noise ratios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Negative Pre-aware Cross-modal (NPC) matching approach. 
- Key idea is to estimate the negative impact of each sample before training the model, instead of correcting noisy samples.
- A memory bank is constructed by selecting high-confidence clean samples using Gaussian Mixture Models.
- The memory bank assists in estimating per-sample negative impact. Samples with high negative impact get lower confidence weights.
- The model is trained by re-weighting samples based on confidence weights, along with additional supervision from the memory bank.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new Negative Pre-aware paradigm for robust cross-modal learning that avoids limitations of noise identification and correction approaches.
- Constructs reliable memory bank to assist in negative impact estimation without needing additional correction mechanisms.
- Achieves significantly higher accuracy and stability than state-of-the-art methods under increasing noise ratios on benchmark datasets.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the approach for addressing noise robustness and stability challenges in cross-modal matching.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel stable learning approach for noisy cross-modal matching by focusing on forecasting negative impact rather than noise identification and correction. The memory bank is an essential component to enable robust estimation.
