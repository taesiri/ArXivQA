# [Negative Pre-aware for Noisy Cross-modal Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cross-modal matching aims to align images and texts in a common space to measure their similarity. It has applications in areas like image captioning and visual question answering.
- Existing datasets contain noisy correspondences between images and texts, which negatively impacts model performance. As the noise ratio increases, model performance becomes increasingly unstable.
- Existing methods rely on identifying and correcting the noisy samples, but this approach has limitations, especially with high noise ratios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Negative Pre-aware Cross-modal (NPC) matching approach. 
- Key idea is to estimate the negative impact of each sample before training the model, instead of correcting noisy samples.
- A memory bank is constructed by selecting high-confidence clean samples using Gaussian Mixture Models.
- The memory bank assists in estimating per-sample negative impact. Samples with high negative impact get lower confidence weights.
- The model is trained by re-weighting samples based on confidence weights, along with additional supervision from the memory bank.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new Negative Pre-aware paradigm for robust cross-modal learning that avoids limitations of noise identification and correction approaches.
- Constructs reliable memory bank to assist in negative impact estimation without needing additional correction mechanisms.
- Achieves significantly higher accuracy and stability than state-of-the-art methods under increasing noise ratios on benchmark datasets.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the approach for addressing noise robustness and stability challenges in cross-modal matching.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel stable learning approach for noisy cross-modal matching by focusing on forecasting negative impact rather than noise identification and correction. The memory bank is an essential component to enable robust estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Negative Pre-aware Cross-modal (NPC) matching approach to achieve robust learning for visual-language model fine-tuning on noisy downstream tasks by estimating the negative impact of each sample before model training and assigning confidence weights to mitigate that impact.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It highlights the challenge of maintaining stable performance for noise-robust learning models as the amount of noise increases during large visual-language model fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

2. It introduces the Negative Pre-aware Cross-modal (NPC) matching paradigm by establishing a memory bank for negative impact estimation. It employs the assistance of memory entries to allocate confidence weights ($w$) to samples. These components help achieve stable and highly noise-resistant performance.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on two manual-annotated datasets and a real-world dataset, showcasing NPC's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, both quantitative and qualitative results affirm that NPC demonstrates notably higher performance stability compared to previous methods with increasing noise.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the NPC approach to improve performance stability for noise-robust learning in cross-modal matching, especially when the noise ratio is high. This is achieved by estimating the negative impact of each sample before modeling and assigning confidence weights to mitigate that impact.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing the Negative Pre-aware (NP) paradigm? How is it different from previous paradigms for cross-modal noise-robust learning?
