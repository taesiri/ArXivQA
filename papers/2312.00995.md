# [Second-Order Uncertainty Quantification: A Distance-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00995)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Representing and quantifying predictive uncertainty is important in machine learning, especially for safety-critical applications. 
- Commonly used uncertainty measures based on information theory for second-order distributions (distributions over probability distributions) have recently been criticized for not satisfying desirable theoretical properties.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a set of formal criteria (axioms A0-A8) that meaningful uncertainty measures based on second-order distributions should satisfy.
- They introduce a general framework to derive aleatoric, epistemic and total uncertainty measures based on distances between the second-order distribution and reference sets representing minimal uncertainty.
- They instantiate this framework using the Wasserstein distance and prove the resulting uncertainty measures satisfy all proposed criteria.

Key Contributions:
- Identification of limitations of existing second-order uncertainty measures using a set of reasonable criteria.
- A flexible distance-based framework to obtain uncertainty measures adhering to the criteria.
- An instantiation using the Wasserstein distance with proofs that the criteria are fulfilled.
- Closed-form uncertainty computations for the popular Dirichlet distribution.
- The framework allows for different metric choices while providing guidance on defining suitable reference sets.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical contributions regarding formalizing desires properties of second-order uncertainty measures, proposes a distance-based approach to obtain measures satisfying them, and proves its feasibility using the Wasserstein distance.
