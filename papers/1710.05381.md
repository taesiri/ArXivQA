# [A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional   neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05381)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

What is the impact of class imbalance on the classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and how do different methods compare in addressing this issue?

The key hypothesis is that class imbalance hurts CNN classification performance, and that oversampling minority classes will be the most effective method for dealing with this problem.

In particular, the paper systematically investigates:

- The effects of class imbalance on CNN classification performance, in terms of multi-class ROC AUC.

- How oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding compare in addressing class imbalance for CNNs. 

- Whether oversampling causes overfitting in CNNs like it can for other machine learning models.

- How the impact of class imbalance and the performance of methods scale to tasks of increasing complexity (from MNIST to CIFAR-10 to ImageNet).

So in summary, the central research question is understanding the impact of class imbalance on CNNs and identifying the most effective technique for dealing with it. The key hypothesis is that oversampling will emerge as the dominant method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whereas previous work mostly focused on traditional machine learning models. 

2. It investigates the impact of class imbalance on CNN classification performance using three benchmark datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. The results show that class imbalance has a detrimental effect on performance that increases with the complexity of the task.

3. It compares several common methods for addressing class imbalance, including oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding. The results indicate that oversampling is the dominant method that improves performance in most scenarios. 

4. It shows that oversampling does not cause overfitting in CNNs like it can in some traditional models. The paper also provides guidance on how much oversampling is needed.

5. It demonstrates that thresholding can improve overall accuracy by compensating for the class prior probabilities learned from imbalanced data.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a systematic study of class imbalance in CNNs and guidance on effective methods for dealing with it, with oversampling identified as the generally preferred approach. The paper fills an important gap given the widespread use of CNNs and the prevalence of class imbalance in real-world applications.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a systematic study of the detrimental effects of class imbalance on convolutional neural network performance and shows that oversampling emerges as the dominant method for addressing the issue across a variety of datasets and imbalance scenarios.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper provides a systematic study on the effects of class imbalance on convolutional neural network (CNN) classification performance, which is lacking in prior work. The key contributions compared to related work are:

- Comprehensively evaluates the impact of different levels and types of class imbalance on CNN classification across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet). Most prior work only looks at binary classification or a single dataset.

- Compares a wide range of techniques to mitigate imbalance - oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, thresholding. Evaluates these techniques across different scenarios which allows more generalizable conclusions. 

- Tests imbalanced training while keeping other factors like total training iterations constant. This isolates the effects of imbalance versus just having less data.

- Evaluates overfitting of sampling techniques on CNNs. Finds oversampling does not cause overfitting, unlike in some classical ML models. 

- Recommends oversampling as the dominant technique, while undersampling can be comparable in some high imbalance cases. Provides practical guidelines on applying sampling.

- Shows thresholding is effective at recovering accuracy lost due to skewed training set priors.

Overall, this paper provides one of the most extensive empirical evaluations of class imbalance effects and mitigation techniques for CNNs. The systematic experiments and model comparisons result in practical insights and recommendations for handling imbalance in CNN training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Further investigation of the effect of class imbalance on more complex tasks like fine-grained image classification and segmentation. They acknowledge their results indicate caution should be taken when applying sampling techniques to highly complex tasks with extreme imbalance.

- Exploring if there are some types of architectures more robust to imbalance than others. The authors only used standard CNN architectures like LeNet and ResNet in their study.

- Testing different versions of sampling methods like informed oversampling (SMOTE) or cleaning undersampling techniques. Only basic random sampling was evaluated.

- Analysis of ensemble-based approaches like EasyEnsemble or BalanceCascade adapted to deep learning. The authors did not evaluate ensemble methods due to expensive training of multiple deep networks.

- Developing new algorithmic methods optimized specifically for class imbalance in deep learning, as most existing techniques originate from classical machine learning.

- Comparing different implementations of cost-sensitive training like weighted loss functions. The authors only tested threshold moving for offsetting class priors.

In summary, the main suggestions are further analysis on more complex tasks and extreme imbalances, evaluating a wider range of sampling techniques, new algorithmic methods tailored to deep learning, and cost-sensitive training approaches beyond simple thresholding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a systematic study investigating the impact of class imbalance on the classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors compare several commonly used methods for addressing class imbalance, including oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding. Using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets with artificially induced class imbalance, they evaluate the methods by the multi-class area under the ROC curve metric. The key findings are: class imbalance detrimentally impacts CNN performance, with more complexity exacerbating the effect; oversampling emerged as the best method overall, fully eliminating imbalance; undersampling can be comparable to oversampling given sufficient minority classes; oversampling does not overfit CNNs; and thresholding helps maximize accuracy. The authors conclude oversampling should be used to eliminate imbalance, while undersampling depends on extent, and thresholding should complement sampling for accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a systematic study on the impact of class imbalance on the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors use three benchmark datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - to investigate the effects of two types of class imbalance: step imbalance, where there is a sharp difference in sample sizes between minority and majority classes, and linear imbalance, where sample sizes decrease linearly. They compare several commonly used methods to address class imbalance, including oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding. 

The key findings are: (1) class imbalance has a substantial detrimental effect on CNN performance, and this effect increases with task complexity, (2) oversampling emerges as the best method overall, improving performance in most scenarios without overfitting, (3) undersampling can be comparable to oversampling for extreme imbalance ratios, (4) two-phase training does not provide benefits over single-phase training, and (5) thresholding can help recover accuracy lost due to shifted class priors. The authors provide practical recommendations such as oversampling to the level that eliminates imbalance and using thresholding to compensate for shifted priors. Overall, this is a comprehensive study that sheds light on the effects and mitigation of class imbalance for CNNs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper systematically compares different methods for addressing class imbalance when training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors create artificial class imbalance in three image classification datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. They then train CNNs on these imbalanced datasets using different techniques: oversampling of the minority classes, undersampling of the majority classes, two-phase training with pre-training on a balanced dataset, and thresholding to compensate for the imbalanced class distribution. The results across the datasets consistently show that oversampling minority classes gives the best performance in terms of multi-class area under the ROC curve (AUC). The authors recommend oversampling to the level that eliminates class imbalance, as opposed to undersampling or partial over/undersampling. They also find that oversampling does not cause overfitting in CNNs, contrary to some classical machine learning models. Overall, the study provides a systematic analysis of techniques to handle class imbalance with deep neural networks.
