# [CESAR: Automatic Induction of Compositional Instructions for Multi-turn   Dialogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17376)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes CESAR, a novel framework for automatically generating complex compositional dialog tasks by combining multiple simple tasks. CESAR modularizes dialog tasks into different components like context, constraints, and outputs. It allows automatic merging of task components to create new composite tasks, enabling large-scale complex task data generation without manual oversight. The authors apply CESAR to enhance the InstructDial benchmark into InstructDial++, incorporating more datasets (63 total) and atomic tasks (86 total) plus 68 novel composite tasks. Experiments demonstrate CESAR's ability to improve models' compositional generalization - a CESAR-trained model handles complex multi-constraint dialog prompts better than baselines. additional benefits include improving atomic task performance and better generalizing to unseen composite tasks. Overall, CESAR helps bridge the gap between public and state-of-the-art proprietary dialog models by facilitating large-scale complex dialog data generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes CESAR, a framework to automatically generate compositional dialog tasks from atomic ones to improve dialog systems' ability to handle complex instructions, and introduces InstructDial++, an expanded benchmark with additional datasets, basic tasks, and new compositional dialog tasks created using CESAR.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes CESAR, a framework to modularize and unify dialog tasks in a way that allows automatic combination of tasks to generate complex compositional instructions without manual effort. 

2) It introduces InstructDial++, an updated version of the InstructDial benchmark, which incorporates more datasets and tasks. InstructDial++ also utilizes CESAR to include compositional tasks, resulting in a total of 86 basic tasks and 68 composite tasks over 63 datasets.

3) Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that including compositional tasks in training data improves performance on both seen and unseen compositional tasks. It also shows that compositional data improves atomic task performance under similar training budgets. Overall, the framework and benchmark aim to improve dialog models' ability to handle complex instructions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the CESAR method proposed in the paper:

1. How does CESAR modularize dialog tasks into different components like context, state, evidence, action, and response? What is the benefit of this modularization?

2. The paper mentions mapping dialog items to dialog components. What are some examples of dialog items and what components would you map them to?

3. Explain the difference between atomic and compositional tasks in CESAR. How does CESAR leverage atomic tasks to automatically create compositional tasks?

4. What are the rules or constraints that CESAR employs to filter out invalid compositional tasks? Provide some examples of tasks that would be filtered out.

5. How does the concept of n-D tasks relate to atomic vs compositional tasks? Provide some examples of 0-D, 1-D and 2-D tasks.

6. The CESAR framework includes Chain-of-Thought reasoning elements. Explain how CoT reasoning can be incorporated into CESAR tasks with examples.

7. What techniques does CESAR use to make task prompts order invariant? Why is order invariance important?

8. How were the downstream tasks in InstructDial++ mapped to different CESAR grounding tasks like IC-S and ICS-R? Provide 1-2 examples.

9. What metrics were used to evaluate compositional tasks? Why was accuracy alone not sufficient for some compositions?  

10. How does training with CESAR's compositional demonstrations help improve performance on both seen and unseen compositions according to the results?
