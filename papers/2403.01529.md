# [Deep Incremental Model Based Reinforcement Learning: A One-Step Lookback   Approach for Continuous Robotics Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in continuous control tasks like robotics. Model-free RL requires large amounts of real-world interaction before learning a good policy. Model-based RL (MBRL) attempts to address this by learning a model of the environment and using it to improve data efficiency. However, model learning can be difficult, especially for high-dimensional systems like robots. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a "deep incremental model" for MBRL that is tailored to robotics control. It represents the robot dynamics as an "incremental evolution model" which predicts state transitions based on the change in actions between timesteps. This simplifies model learning into a matrix estimation problem and is favorable for high-dimensional systems. The model is learned incrementally on real experience data. Imagined transitions from the learned model are then used to supplement the real data for policy optimization via soft actor-critic.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates an incremental evolution model for robot dynamics that only requires learning a parameter matrix, reducing complexity for high-dimensional robots
- Learns the model incrementally on real experience data  
- Generates imagined transitions from learned model to augment real data
- Validates approach on MuJoCo continuous control tasks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency over model-free methods
- Provides an alternative and control-oriented modeling approach for MBRL that is simple yet effective compared to other techniques

The incremental modeling approach aims to strike a balance between model accuracy and complexity. Results show it can efficiently learn a useful robot dynamics model to significantly boost sample efficiency of a model-free RL algorithm. The intuitive model structure has the potential to extend to complex, high-dimensional robotic systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient model-based reinforcement learning approach for continuous control that learns an incremental evolution model using one-step backward data and control theory knowledge, then leverages the model to generate additional training data and improve policy learning sample efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new approach for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) called the "one-step lookback approach". Specifically:

- It utilizes control-theoretical knowledge and one-step backward (OSBK) data to formulate an "incremental evolution model" as an alternative structured representation of the robot dynamics model for MBRL. 

- This incremental evolution model transforms the nonlinear robot dynamics into a parameterized linear form, which makes it much easier to learn compared to learning the full nonlinear dynamics.

- A neural network is then trained on input-output data to learn the parameters of this incremental evolution model.

- The learned model is used to generate imagined/simulated data to supplement the real training data for policy learning, improving sample efficiency.

So in summary, the main contribution is using control theory and OSBK data to create a simplified parameterized dynamics model that is easier to learn and can improve the data efficiency of policy learning through generating simulated experience, tested on continuous control benchmarks. The simplicity of the model is aimed to make it favorable for high-dimensional robotics problems.

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Model based reinforcement learning (MBRL)
- Incremental evolution model
- Continuous robotics control
- One-step lookback approach
- Sample efficiency 
- Latent-space model

- Soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm

The paper proposes a one-step lookback approach for deep incremental model based reinforcement learning to realize sample-efficient continuous robotic control. It utilizes control-theoretical knowledge to formulate an incremental evolution model, which is learned jointly with the policy. The model is then used in a Dyna-style to generate imagined data to supplement the real environment data for enhancing sample efficiency. Comparative simulations are done using benchmark continuous control tasks. So the key terms revolve around model based RL, incremental modeling, sample efficiency, and continuous control.
