# [Investigating Multi-Hop Factual Shortcuts in Knowledge Editing of Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities in recalling knowledge and reasoning. However, their reliability in combining these capabilities for multi-hop reasoning has not been widely explored.  

- LLMs may utilize factual "shortcuts" learned from pre-training corpora to directly get answers to multi-hop questions, without genuinely engaging in step-wise reasoning. This can cause inconsistencies after knowledge editing.

Methodology:
- The authors systematically investigate the existence of factual shortcuts in LLMs for answering multi-hop questions. 

- They analyze the correlation between shortcut strength and co-occurrence frequencies of entities in pre-training corpora. 

- They use Knowledge Neurons to quantify reasoning overlaps between multi-hop and single-hop questions. Less overlap suggests the presence of shortcuts.

- They analyze failures in multi-hop knowledge editing to understand risks from shortcuts. 

- They propose erasing crucial shortcut neurons to mitigate associated risks.

Key Findings:
- Strength of shortcuts correlates with frequency of entity co-occurrences in pre-training corpora.

- Few-shot prompting relies more on shortcuts compared to chain-of-thought prompting.  

- Around 20% of failures in knowledge editing are attributed to factual shortcuts. Failures often have higher entity co-occurrence.

- Erasing shortcut neurons significantly reduces failure rates and improves success of knowledge editing.

Main Contributions:  
- Formalized and investigated the role of factual shortcuts in LLMs for multi-hop reasoning

- Demonstrated correlation between shortcut strength and pre-training corpus statistics

- Showed risks of shortcuts in causing inconsistencies after knowledge editing 

- Proposed an approach to identify and mitigate shortcuts to improve multi-hop reasoning
