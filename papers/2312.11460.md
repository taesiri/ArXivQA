# [Hybrid Internal Model: A Simple and Efficient Learner for Agile Legged   Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Robust locomotion control of legged robots depends on accurate state estimation. However, most legged robots have only partial and noisy onboard sensor observations, making it challenging to estimate external states like terrain properties. Prior methods use a two-stage approach - first train an oracle policy with full state information, then transfer it using mimicking. This causes performance loss and constraints further optimization.

Method: 
The paper proposes a Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) within a model-based reinforcement learning framework to estimate external disturbances from the robot's response. HIM consists of two components:
1) Velocity estimation that tracks commanded velocity 
2) Implicit stability representation optimized via contrastive learning to be close to future states.  

Together they form a hybrid internal embedding that captures explicit velocity tracking and implicit stability maintenance goals. HIM uses proprioception from joint encoders and IMU as input. The embedding is optimized via Hybrid Internal Optimization and used with partial observations to train a policy network with PPO.

Benefits:
- Only uses onboard proprioceptive sensors 
- Avoids info loss in mimicking methods
- More sample efficient due to batch-level optimization
- More robust to noise via contrastive learning
- Lightweight and platform-agnostic

Results: 
- Outperforms prior methods on various terrains and disturbances in simulation and real-world
- Generalizes to unseen environments like stairs, payloads, hits, missing steps etc.
- Converges in 200M samples and 1 hour on an RTX 4090 GPU
- Deployed on Unitree A1, Aliengo and Go1 robots

Main contributions:
1) A new perspective connecting classical control concepts with learning for state estimation
2) An efficient way to leverage batch-level information in locomotion tasks 
3) State-of-the-art performance using only onboard sensors
4) Excellent generalizability to diverse disturbances with fast convergence


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Hybrid Internal Model approach for efficient legged locomotion control that implicitly estimates terrain properties by optimizing an internal state embedding to match future proprioceptive observations, enabling deployment on real robots with only basic onboard sensors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method called Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) for robust legged locomotion control. The key ideas and benefits of HIM include:

1) It considers external states like terrain friction and elevation as disturbances, and estimates them by modeling the simulated response (velocity and stability) of the robot based on its proprioceptive observations. This is inspired by classical Internal Model Control principles.

2) The simulated response (hybrid internal embedding) is optimized to be close to the robot's future state using contrastive learning. This makes the method more robust and sample-efficient compared to using regression objectives.

3) HIM only relies on basic proprioceptive sensors like joint encoders and IMU, making it lightweight and applicable to any legged robot platform. It does not need access to terrain information or other privileged states.

4) Despite not using any terrain information, HIM can enable policies that perform similarly to policies trained with full state information in simulation. The policies also transfer well to diverse real-world conditions.

5) HIM is simple, efficient (converging with 200 million samples in 1 hour on an RTX 4090 GPU), and demonstrates excellent open-world generalizability in very challenging unseen terrains and disturbances in the real-world.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the HIM method for robust locomotion control policies using only onboard proprioception, with demonstrations of simplicity, efficiency, and strong sim2real transfer.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Hybrid Internal Model (HIM): The proposed method to estimate external environmental states like terrain friction and elevation by modeling the simulated response of the robot. It consists of an explicit velocity estimation and an implicit stability representation.

- Contrastive learning: Used to optimize the hybrid internal embedding to be close to the robot's future state. This allows the policy network to distinguish disturbances without directly accessing the ground truth states.

- Proprioceptive observations: The inputs to the policy network, including desired velocity, joint positions/velocities, IMU data, etc. No exteroceptive sensors like cameras or lidar are used.

- Sample efficiency: The method exploits batch-level information across parallel environments for more effective learning. Convergence is achieved with only 200 million samples.

- Generalizability: Experiments show strong simulation-to-real transfer and ability to handle novel/unseen terrains not encountered during training. Reveals good open-world capabilities.

- Agile locomotion: Real-world tests demonstrate robust traversal of difficult terrains like stairs, slopes, discrete obstacles under disturbances. The method enables high locomotion agility.

In summary, the key ideas are using a hybrid internal model optimized with contrastive learning to enable sample-efficient learning of agile blind locomotion policies relying solely on proprioception.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The hybrid internal model estimates both velocity and stability response of the robot. What is the intuition behind modeling both explicit velocity and implicit stability response? How do they complement each other?

2. Contrastive learning is used to optimize the hybrid internal embedding. Why is contrastive learning preferred over regression for this task? What are the benefits it provides over regression?

3. The method uses only proprioceptive observations from joint encoders and IMU. What is the rationale behind not using exteroceptive sensors? What challenges would adding other sensors like camera or lidar present?

4. Batch-level information is exploited in contrastive learning for better sample efficiency. How exactly does the batch-level information help improve sample efficiency and robustness compared to online methods?

5. The terrain curriculum uses incremental difficulty levels for various terrains. What is the importance of this curriculum strategy? How does it impact training efficiency?

6. Ablation studies show that both velocity estimation and internal latent loss are important. What specific roles do they play in the overall framework? How does absence of each impact performance?

7. Compared to regression baseline, what advantages does contrastive learning provide for optimizing the internal model? Why does regression perform poorly?

8. The method shows excellent zero-shot sim2real transfer and generalizability. What properties enable this? How can it be further improved?

9. For real-world deployment, a PD controller tracks the target positions output by the policy network. What is the effect of this two-level control scheme?

10. The method currently only exploits proprioceptive observations. How can the framework be extended to utilize exteroceptive information like vision as well for more complex tasks?
