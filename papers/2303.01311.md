# [Zero-Shot Text-to-Parameter Translation for Game Character Auto-Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve zero-shot text-driven game character auto-creation. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel text-to-parameter translation (T2P) method to automatically create vivid in-game characters based on arbitrary text prompts, without needing any reference images.

The key points are:

- Previous image-driven game character auto-creation methods require reference photos, which is cumbersome. This paper aims to achieve text-driven auto-creation based on flexible text prompts.

- The paper proposes to search both continuous and discrete facial parameters in a unified framework to create vivid characters. Previous methods gave up discrete parameters due to difficulty in optimization. 

- The predicted physically meaningful facial parameters enable further editing of the created characters. Implicit representations used in other text-to-3D works lack this advantage.

- Experiments show the proposed T2P outperforms other text-to-3D methods in objective and subjective evaluations. Both the optimization efficiency and quality of the created characters demonstrate the effectiveness of T2P.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that the proposed text-to-parameter translation method can achieve high-quality zero-shot game character auto-creation based on text prompts in a unified optimization framework. Both the objective and subjective evaluations verify this hypothesis.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel text-to-parameter translation method (T2P) to achieve zero-shot text-driven game character auto-creation, which utilizes a pre-trained translator and evolution search to optimize both continuous and discrete facial parameters in a unified framework to generate vivid in-game characters consistent with arbitrary text prompts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text-driven game character creation:

- This paper proposes a novel method called "text-to-parameter translation" (T2P) for zero-shot text-driven game character creation. It is one of the first papers to tackle this specific problem of generating game-ready characters from text prompts. 

- Most prior work on text-to-image generation focuses on natural images rather than 3D game characters. The most relevant previous work is AvatarCLIP, which also achieves text-driven 3D avatar generation. However, AvatarCLIP uses implicit neural representations while this paper generates explicit facial parameters to control a game engine, which is more suitable for game environments.

- Compared to other text-to-3D work like DreamFusion and AvatarCLIP, this paper demonstrates superior performance in objective metrics like Inception Score and subjective evaluations. The generated characters are rated as more realistic and consistent with the input text prompts.

- A key contribution is the ability to optimize both continuous and discrete facial parameters in a unified framework. Previous face-to-parameter translation methods only handled continuous parameters, while this can also search discrete parameters like hairstyles using an evolution strategy.

- The use of a differentiable renderer and pre-training on large image-parameter datasets seems crucial for the method's quality and efficiency. Fine-tuning on text embeddings is also an effective strategy.

- The generated facial parameters are intuitive for users to control and edit. This could be beneficial for practical game creation workflows compared to purely black-box generative methods.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art for controllable text-to-3D generation focused on game character auto-creation. The unified optimization and focus on generating editable parameters differentiates it from prior text-to-3D work. The results and evaluations demonstrate its advantages over existing methods in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the translator architecture and training strategy to better handle the gap between image embeddings and text embeddings. The authors suggest exploring prompt tuning techniques like P-tuning to help the translator generalize better from image prompts to text prompts.

- Developing better strategies to search the discrete facial parameters space, like introducing prior knowledge or using reinforcement learning methods. The evolution search works but is sample inefficient.

- Extending the framework to control body and clothing parameters in addition to facial parameters to create full 3D avatars. The current method focuses only on facial parameter control. 

- Enabling interactive and incremental updates to further improve the game character based on user feedback. The current method creates the full character in one shot. An interactive workflow could be more user-friendly.

- Exploring conditional generation, like generating different poses and expressions for the same identity given the same text prompt. The current method generates a static neutral pose.

- Improving the diversity of generated characters and enabling control over attributes like age, gender, ethnicity. The current results lack diversity.

- Validating the method on different game engines and 3D face models. More robustness testing would be useful.

- Evaluating the method for text-driven video game character creation by users through user studies. The current evaluations are mainly technical metrics.

In summary, the key future directions are improving the text-to-parameter translation process, expanding controllable attributes, enhancing interactivity, and conducting more comprehensive evaluation and testing. The authors lay out a good research roadmap to build on this work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel text-to-parameter translation method (T2P) to achieve zero-shot text-driven game character auto-creation. The method takes advantage of large-scale pre-trained CLIP to search facial parameters that generate in-game characters consistent with the given text prompts. T2P consists of a pre-training stage and a text-to-parameter translation stage. In the pre-training stage, an imitator is trained to mimic the game engine for differentiable rendering. A translator is also pre-trained to map CLIP image embeddings to facial parameters. At the translation stage, the translator is fine-tuned on CLIP text embeddings to predict continuous facial parameters. Meanwhile, discrete facial parameters are searched by evolution. The predicted facial parameters are fed into the game engine to create vivid in-game characters. Unlike previous methods giving up controlling difficult discrete parameters, T2P searches both continuous and discrete parameters in a unified framework. Experiments show T2P can generate high-quality and vivid game characters with given text prompts. It outperforms other SOTA methods in objective and subjective evaluations.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel framework named T2P for zero-shot text-driven in-game character creation. T2P leverages CLIP and evolution search to predict both continuous and discrete facial parameters that generate vivid game characters consistent with the given text prompts. Experiments demonstrate the proposed T2P achieves better performance compared with previous SOTA methods. It provides a more flexible and efficient way for game character auto-creation.
