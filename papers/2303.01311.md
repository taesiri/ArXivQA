# [Zero-Shot Text-to-Parameter Translation for Game Character Auto-Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve zero-shot text-driven game character auto-creation. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel text-to-parameter translation (T2P) method to automatically create vivid in-game characters based on arbitrary text prompts, without needing any reference images.

The key points are:

- Previous image-driven game character auto-creation methods require reference photos, which is cumbersome. This paper aims to achieve text-driven auto-creation based on flexible text prompts.

- The paper proposes to search both continuous and discrete facial parameters in a unified framework to create vivid characters. Previous methods gave up discrete parameters due to difficulty in optimization. 

- The predicted physically meaningful facial parameters enable further editing of the created characters. Implicit representations used in other text-to-3D works lack this advantage.

- Experiments show the proposed T2P outperforms other text-to-3D methods in objective and subjective evaluations. Both the optimization efficiency and quality of the created characters demonstrate the effectiveness of T2P.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that the proposed text-to-parameter translation method can achieve high-quality zero-shot game character auto-creation based on text prompts in a unified optimization framework. Both the objective and subjective evaluations verify this hypothesis.
