# [Pretext-Contrastive Learning: Toward Good Practices in Self-supervised   Video Representation Leaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15464)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we combine pretext tasks and contrastive learning in a general framework to boost performance on self-supervised video representation learning?The authors propose combining pretext tasks (which focus on learning representations within a sample) and contrastive learning (which aims to distinguish between different instances) into a joint optimization framework called Pretext-Contrastive Learning (PCL). Their goal is to show that this framework can facilitate the advantages of both pretext tasks and contrastive learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks like video retrieval and recognition. They test their PCL framework on three different pretext task baselines using different network backbones. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over the individual baselines and the generality of their framework across tasks and models. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, they aim to show that each component of their proposal (pretext task, contrastive learning, residual clips, data augmentation) contributes positively to performance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining pretext tasks and contrastive learning in an effective general framework can boost performance on self-supervised video representation learning across different models and tasks. The experiments and results are meant to demonstrate and validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. Proposing a joint optimization framework called Pretext-Contrastive Learning (PCL) that combines pretext tasks and contrastive learning to take advantage of both approaches for self-supervised video representation learning. 2. Showing that with proper data processing strategies like using residual clips and strong data augmentations, the PCL framework can greatly boost the performance of existing pretext task baselines as well as contrastive learning baselines.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of the PCL framework by testing it with different pretext task baselines, network backbones, and evaluation tasks/datasets. The results show consistent and significant improvements.4. Achieving new state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks with PCL, while using much less pre-training data than prior methods.5. Providing extensive ablation studies and analysis to validate the impact of different components of their framework like residual clips, augmentations, loss balancing etc.6. Setting up an easily adaptable PCL framework that can serve as a standard training strategy to be applied to many existing self-supervised video representation learning methods to improve their performance.In summary, the key novelty seems to be in systematically exploring and pushing the limits of combining pretext tasks and contrastive learning under a joint optimization framework augmented with data processing strategies to set new state-of-the-art benchmarks for self-supervised video representation learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in self-supervised video representation learning:- The paper proposes a joint optimization framework called "Pretext-Contrastive Learning" (PCL) that combines pretext tasks and contrastive learning. This builds on prior work showing benefits of combining pretext tasks, and combining pretext tasks with contrastive learning. However, this paper provides a more thorough investigation and shows the generality of the approach across multiple pretext task methods.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on two common benchmark datasets for self-supervised video representation learning (UCF101 and HMDB51). The proposed PCL framework achieves significantly better performance compared to prior state-of-the-art methods when using comparable training datasets and network architectures. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.- The paper conducts extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of the framework like residual clips, data augmentations, loss weighting etc. This provides useful insights into what makes the framework effective that can inform future research.- The visualization analysis and case studies provide some interesting analysis about how PCL combines the advantages of pretext tasks and contrastive learning. For example, compensating for weaknesses in temporal modeling of contrastive learning alone.- The paper focuses on the common setting of using only RGB frames as input for self-supervised pretraining, rather than optical flow or other modalities. This makes the results more directly comparable to many other works.- The approach is flexible and could be applied to enhance many existing methods that use pretext tasks or contrastive learning. This means it provides a general training strategy rather than just a singular method.Overall, by conducting a very thorough experimental investigation, this paper provides useful insights into effective practices for combining pretext tasks and contrastive learning. The proposed PCL framework sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks while using less pretraining data than some prior works. The analyses and ablation studies also will help inform future research in this area.
