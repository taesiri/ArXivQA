# [Assessing the Impact of Prompting, Persona, and Chain of Thought Methods   on ChatGPT's Arithmetic Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores whether various methods such as prompting, persona implementation, and the Chain of Thought approach can enhance the mathematical problem-solving abilities of ChatGPT. The goal is to benchmark ChatGPT's default capabilities on arithmetic tasks and determine if these interventions can improve its performance.

Methods
The study utilizes three datasets - MATH, GSM8K, and MMLU covering diverse mathematical problems across difficulty levels. Several experiments are conducted by applying different prompts, personas and chain of thought conversations to guide ChatGPT. A rigorous grading methodology is designed to evaluate the model's accuracy.

Results
The findings reveal mixed outcomes - while certain persona settings and chain of thought methods induce slight improvements on some datasets, none of the techniques consistently enhance ChatGPT's baseline arithmetic skills. In fact, some interventions like "no explanation" persona lower performance. 

Conclusions
The paper concludes that currently, the examined methods do not substantially improve ChatGPT's computational abilities. However, it highlights the significance of strategic prompt engineering in shaping model behavior. More research into innovative ways of enhancing language model performance across domains is warranted.

Contributions  
The key contributions include:
1) Comprehensive benchmarking of ChatGPT's default arithmetic skills
2) Analysis of various methods and their impacts on mathematical problem-solving 
3) A robust evaluation methodology and datasets for future research
4) Insights into the current limitations of techniques meant to improve language models

In summary, while the specific methods tested do not augment ChatGPT's math proficiency, this study sets the foundation for more explorations into prompt engineering for enhancing model capabilities.
