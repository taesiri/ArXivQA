# [Digital Comprehensibility Assessment of Simplified Texts among Persons   with Intellectual Disabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text simplification aims to improve text comprehensibility for target groups like people with intellectual disabilities. However, automatic text simplification (ATS) systems are typically evaluated by experts or crowd workers instead of the target users. 
- There is a lack of research on suitable quantitative methods to measure text comprehensibility that include representatives from the primary target groups.
- The use of mobile touchscreen devices is increasing among target groups of simplified texts. Digital tools offer potential for more inclusive and efficient text comprehensibility assessments.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct an empirical study evaluating text comprehensibility with 36 participants - 18 with intellectual disabilities (target group) and 18 without (control group).
- Use original, manually simplified, and automatically simplified German texts. Manually simplified texts followed expert guidelines for simplified language.  
- Explore four measurements: comprehension question accuracy, perceived difficulty ratings, response times, and reading speeds. 
- Apply Bayesian statistical models that account for differences between participants, questions, and text versions.

Key Findings:
- Comprehension questions were most reliable for the target group. Ratings were less consistent.
- For the target group, manual simplification improved comprehension questions and ratings compared to original texts. Automatic simplification only affected ratings.
- For the control group, all measurements showed manual simplification was more comprehensible than original texts. Automatic simplification was equally or more difficult. 
- Reading speeds revealed behavioral patterns like skipping texts, especially in the target group.

Main Contributions:
- First study evaluating automatic text simplification for German with target users with intellectual disabilities
- Comparison of different quantitative methods to measure text comprehensibility with and without target users
- Evidence that subjective difficulty ratings are less reliable with target users
- Showing the need to include primary target users in evaluations of text simplification systems
