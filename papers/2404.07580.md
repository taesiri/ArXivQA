# [Multi-rater Prompting for Ambiguous Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-rater annotations in medical images pose two main challenges: (1) How to train a model when multiple raters/experts provide a set of plausible but diverse annotations for the same image. (2) How to efficiently fine-tune a pre-trained model on new datasets from different domains without requiring heavy computation resources to retrain the entire model.

Proposed Solution - PU-Net
- Uses prompt learning to handle multi-rater annotations and uncertainty. Introduces rater-aware prompts that treat raters as different input domains.
- Only fine-tunes the small set of prompt parameters instead of the entire model, requiring 0.3% of training parameters compared to full model fine-tuning.
- Has individual prompts for each rater's annotations, plus an aggregated prompt using majority vote labels. This allows modeling both individual rater insights and collective consensus.  
- Uses Implantable Transformer Blocks in U-Net to inject prompts and enhance features with rater information.

Main Contributions:
- Novel prompt-based framework to handle multi-rater ambiguity and reduce computation in medical image segmentation
- Rater-aware prompts to model individual and collective uncertainties 
- Mix-training strategy to exploit both individual and aggregated rater insights
- Experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multi-rater retinal image datasets, while using orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters

In summary, the paper introduces a new way to effectively handle multi-rater annotations in medical imaging using prompt learning, while also requiring much lower fine-tuning computation resources. The proposed PU-Net outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods.
