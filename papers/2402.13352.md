# [KetGPT -- Dataset Augmentation of Quantum Circuits using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a shortage of large quantum circuit datasets that resemble real-world quantum algorithms and can be used to benchmark quantum compilers and hardware. 
- Existing quantum algorithm datasets are limited in size and versatility. 
- Randomly generated quantum circuits lack the inherent structure and properties of real algorithms.
- This shortage of useful quantum benchmarks poses challenges for advancing quantum system development.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces KetGPT, a transformer-based generative model to augment quantum circuit datasets with synthetic yet realistic-looking circuits.
- KetGPT is trained on an existing algorithm-based circuit dataset to learn to generate new circuits that emulate patterns of real algorithms.
- A 3-fold verification process is used to validate the realism of the generated circuits:
  1) Manual inspection and execution with Qiskit
  2) Classification with a separate transformer model
  3) Analysis of circuit structural parameters

Main Contributions:
- KetGPT - a novel transformer architecture tailored for generating realistic quantum circuits
- Methodology for verifying and quantifying realism of generated quantum circuits
- Analysis showing KetGPT circuits closely resemble structure of algorithm-based circuits
- KetGPT allows expanding quantum circuit datasets for benchmarking quantum compilers/hardware
- Envisioned to enable training of AI-based solutions for quantum system software 

In summary, the paper puts forward KetGPT, a transformer-based tool for generating synthetic yet realistic quantum circuits to address the shortage of algorithm-based benchmarks. Through extensive verification, KetGPT shows promise in expanding datasets to advance quantum system development.
