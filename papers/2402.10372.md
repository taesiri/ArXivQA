# [Sequential Manipulation of Deformable Linear Object Networks with   Endpoint Pose Measurements using Adaptive Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10372)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper focuses on the problem of manipulating deformable linear object networks (DLONs), such as automotive wire harnesses. These consist of multiple stiff cables (stiff DLOs or StDLOs) connected together.  
- The goal is to manipulate the DLON using a single robot arm to move each terminal (endpoint) to a desired goal pose for installation. This is challenging since only the terminal poses are measured, not the full state of the DLOs.
- Key constraints are keeping the terminals within the robot's reachable workspace and avoiding collisions with obstacles during manipulation.

Proposed Solution
- The main contribution is a framework for planning and controlling sequential terminal manipulations (TMs) to install a novel DLON using only terminal pose feedback.
- Analysis of simulation data reveals the terminal pose dynamics can be decomposed into simple rigid body terms and residual terms. This motivates an adaptive 'composite' model for control.
- An adaptive model predictive controller (MPC) plans optimal motions respecting workspace/collision constraints using the adaptive model, which combines a rigid body model with a learned linear model.
- A simple but effective heuristic selects the sequence of TMs based on terminal proximity to constraints.

Main Contributions
- Demonstrates feasibility of output-based control for planar DLON installation without full state measurement. 
- Develops an adaptive composite model that enables instant control without exploration while refining accuracy over time.
- Validates the proposed approach successfully manipulates DLONs in simulation and physical experiments without any prior training.

The key advantage is enabling DLON installation on new systems not seen previously by combining simple dynamics models with online learning, respecting critical workspace and collision constraints. The experiments show promising results, though limitations around non-planar DLONs are discussed for future work.
