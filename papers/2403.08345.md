# [From human experts to machines: An LLM supported approach to ontology   and knowledge graph construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Ontology and knowledge graph (KG) construction is resource intensive, requiring substantial time and expertise of multiple stakeholders. There is a need for methods to reduce the human effort involved.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a semi-automated pipeline for ontology and KG construction using large language models (LLMs). 

- The pipeline has 6 main steps:
   1) Data collection 
   2) Competency question (CQ) generation - CQs gathered from domain experts and augmented by LLM
   3) Ontology creation - Concepts and relations extracted from CQs; LLM generates ontology 
   4) CQ answering - Answers for CQs generated from publications using retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
   5) KG construction - Entities and relations extracted from CQ answers and mapped to ontology
   6) Evaluation - LLM judge evaluates alignment of generated answers and KG concepts with human annotations

- Open source LLM Mixtral 8x7B is used through the pipeline. Humans are involved in loop for CQ verification and evaluation.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates feasibility of semi-automated pipeline for ontology and KG construction using open source LLMs. 
- Showcases potential to reduce human effort in these knowledge engineering processes.
- Provides publicly available implementation of pipeline applied for a use case of capturing provenance of deep learning pipelines from scholarly publications.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution in exploring and evaluating the utility of LLMs to semi-automate tedious aspects of ontology and KG engineering. The proposed pipeline with human-in-loop supervision balances automation with quality assurance.
