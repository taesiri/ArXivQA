# [Articulated Object Manipulation with Coarse-to-fine Affordance for   Mitigating the Effect of Point Cloud Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for 3D articulated object manipulation using point cloud affordance prediction have shown good results in simulation, but fail to directly transfer to real-world scenarios due to noise in real-world scanned point clouds.  
- The noise causes important local geometry details like handles to be distorted or disappear, so the point cloud no longer provides reliable information for fine-grained manipulation.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage the property that point cloud noise decreases when camera is closer to the object.  
- Propose a coarse-to-fine affordance learning framework with two stages:
  1) Coarse stage: Predict affordance on a noisy full object point cloud to give approximate area to manipulate.
  2) Fine stage: Move camera closer to area from coarse prediction to capture less noisy local point cloud of object part. Predict affordance on this to give precise manipulation point and actions.
- Integrate information from both coarse and fine point clouds to retain global context as well as local geometry details.  

Key Contributions:
- Novel coarse-to-fine affordance learning framework to address challenge of real-world noise in point clouds for manipulation.
- Adapt PointNet++ architecture to concurrently encode both far (coarse) and near (fine) point clouds.
- Experiments in both simulation and real-world demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in handling noise and transferring policies to real environments.
- Approach only relies on commercially available RGB-D cameras, making it accessible for widespread adoption.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine affordance learning framework that leverages both far and near point cloud data to mitigate the effects of noise and enable more precise manipulation of articulated objects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel affordance framework that utilizes an eye-on-hand camera to obtain closer views tailored to the requirements of manipulation tasks. This approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by the noise present in the point cloud data. 

2. Adapting PointNet++ to concurrently encode point cloud data captured by both the far and near views of the eye-on-hand camera. 

3. Conducting experiments on noisy point clouds to demonstrate the method can retain detailed geometry information from the closer point cloud and preserve global shape information from the farther point cloud.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a coarse-to-fine affordance learning framework using both far and near point cloud views to mitigate the effect of noise in point clouds for articulated object manipulation.
