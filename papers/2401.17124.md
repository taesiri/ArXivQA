# [Spectral Co-Distillation for Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17124)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Spectral Co-Distillation for Personalized Federated Learning":

Problem:
- Personalized federated learning (PFL) trains customized models for each client to address data heterogeneity issues in federated learning. 
- Existing PFL methods capture model similarities via weight regularization or model decoupling. However, these approaches lack theoretical motivations regarding training dynamics.

Key Idea:
- The paper proposes using Fourier spectrum information to capture model similarities in PFL. This is motivated by the concept of "spectral bias" in deep learning theory - neural nets learn low-frequency components first.  
- Thus, despite conflicting objectives of clients, low-frequency spectra would be similar across global and personalized models. This insight enables new knowledge distillation techniques.

Proposed Solutions:
- Spectral distillation for personalized model training: Uses divergence between full spectra of the global and personalized models as regularization. Transfers holistic knowledge.
- Spectral co-distillation for global model training: Uses divergence between truncated low-frequency spectra as regularization. Transfers foundational knowledge. 
- Together, this enables two-way distillation between the global and personalized models.

Other Contributions:
- A wait-free protocol that eliminates waiting time during communication rounds by pipelining global and personalized model updates. Reduces total training time.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on CIFAR and iNaturalist datasets under heterogeneous settings.
- Proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both global and personalized models, demonstrating efficacy of spectral distillation techniques.
- Wait-free protocol provides 1.5-2x speedups, showing superiority over existing protocols.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel perspective of using Fourier spectral information for knowledge distillation in personalized federated learning. The bi-directional distillation framework and wait-free protocol achieve strong empirical performance.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposes a spectral co-distillation framework for personalized federated learning (PFL) to train better generic and personalized models simultaneously. This is the first work to use spectral distillation and bi-directional co-distillation between the generic and personalized models in PFL. 

2) Proposes a wait-free local training protocol to reduce the overall training time by eliminating idle waiting periods during training. This protocol allows personalized model training to happen in parallel with the global communication of the generic model.

3) Demonstrates through extensive experiments that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art PFL methods in terms of model accuracy and communication efficiency. The superior performance is attributed to the novel use of spectral information for knowledge distillation during both generic and personalized model training.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel spectral co-distillation framework and wait-free training protocol that pushes the state-of-the-art in personalized federated learning.
