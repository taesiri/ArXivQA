# [CelebV-Text: A Large-Scale Facial Text-Video Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14717)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we construct a large-scale, high-quality, diverse facial text-video dataset to facilitate research in facial text-to-video generation? The key hypotheses are:1) By carefully designing a data construction pipeline involving data collection, annotation, and semi-automatic text generation, it is possible to build a high-quality facial text-video dataset.2) This dataset will enable more effective training and evaluation of facial text-to-video generation models compared to existing datasets.3) Extensive analysis will demonstrate the superiority of this new dataset over existing ones in terms of video quality, text diversity/naturalness, and text-video relevance.4) Evaluating strong baselines on the dataset will showcase its potential and effectiveness for facial text-to-video generation research.In summary, the paper aims to construct a new facial video dataset with natural language descriptions, demonstrate its usefulness over existing datasets, and establish strong baselines for future research in this direction. The key novelty is the dataset itself along with comprehensive analyses and benchmarks validating its utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes CelebV-Text, the first large-scale facial text-video dataset with high-quality videos and rich, highly-relevant text descriptions to facilitate research in facial text-to-video generation. 2. It conducts comprehensive statistical analyses to demonstrate the superiority of CelebV-Text in terms of video quality, text diversity/complexity, and text-video relevance.3. It performs self-evaluations to show the effectiveness and potential of CelebV-Text for facial text-to-video generation tasks.4. It constructs a new benchmark with representative methods for standardizing evaluation of the facial text-to-video generation task.In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of the CelebV-Text dataset to push forward research in facial text-to-video generation. The paper thoroughly analyzes the dataset and shows its usefulness through experiments and benchmarking.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper presents CelebV-Text, a large-scale facial text-video dataset containing 70,000 high-quality video clips and 1.4 million descriptive text captions, with comprehensive static and dynamic attribute annotations, to facilitate research in the emerging field of facial text-to-video generation.
