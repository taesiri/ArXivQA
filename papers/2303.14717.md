# [CelebV-Text: A Large-Scale Facial Text-Video Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14717)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we construct a large-scale, high-quality, diverse facial text-video dataset to facilitate research in facial text-to-video generation? The key hypotheses are:1) By carefully designing a data construction pipeline involving data collection, annotation, and semi-automatic text generation, it is possible to build a high-quality facial text-video dataset.2) This dataset will enable more effective training and evaluation of facial text-to-video generation models compared to existing datasets.3) Extensive analysis will demonstrate the superiority of this new dataset over existing ones in terms of video quality, text diversity/naturalness, and text-video relevance.4) Evaluating strong baselines on the dataset will showcase its potential and effectiveness for facial text-to-video generation research.In summary, the paper aims to construct a new facial video dataset with natural language descriptions, demonstrate its usefulness over existing datasets, and establish strong baselines for future research in this direction. The key novelty is the dataset itself along with comprehensive analyses and benchmarks validating its utility.
