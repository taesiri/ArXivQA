# [CoTBal: Comprehensive Task Balancing for Multi-Task Visual Instruction   Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Visual instruction tuning is a key training technique for large multimodal models (LMMs), enabling them to understand visual information. 
- However, indiscriminately mixing instruction-following data from various visual tasks can lead to suboptimal overall performance due to conflicts across tasks with different formats and knowledge domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a novel Comprehensive Task Balancing (CoTBal) algorithm to optimize multi-task visual instruction tuning. This is the first work exploring multi-task optimization for instruction tuning.

- Introduce a Generic Task Weighting (GTW) paradigm that assigns task-specific weights to losses at the token level for multi-task tuning.

- Balance tasks based on two key dimensions: 
   1) Inter-Task Contribution - learning one task can enhance performance in other tasks due to overlapping knowledge. Quantify contribution of Task A to Task B using a normalized performance metric.
   2) Intra-Task Difficulty - some tasks have greater inherent difficulties. Quantify difficulty of a task via normalized gap between models trained on full vs. subset of data.

- Assign more weights to tasks that:
   1) offer substantial contributions to others  
   2) receive minimal contributions from others
   3) have high intra-task difficulties

- Integrate the above strategies into a comprehensive task balancing algorithm - CoTBal.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose the first Generic Task Weighting paradigm tailored for multi-task visual instruction tuning 

2) Devise the CoTBal algorithm that balances multiple visual instruction tuning tasks based on inter-task contributions and intra-task difficulties

3) Experiments show CoTBal enhances overall performance while ensuring task balance, outperforming common multi-task learning methods
