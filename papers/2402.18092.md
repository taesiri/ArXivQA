# [Context-aware Talking Face Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18092)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper introduces a novel setting for talking face video generation - generating a talking face video inside a masked facial region in a context video (e.g. video conferencing) conditioned on an audio clip. This is more challenging than typical talking head synthesis because the generated content should be: (i) synchronized with the audio, and (ii) spatially coherent with the visual context.

Proposed Solution:
A two-stage cross-modal control generation pipeline (TCCP) is proposed. Facial landmarks are used as an intermediate representation to bridge the audio, context video and final talking face video. 

Stage 1 generates a facial landmark sequence that captures audio-visual synchronization and spatial coherence with the context video. This transfers implicit conditions in the context video to explicit landmarks.

Stage 2 generates the final talking face video conditioned on the landmarks from stage 1. This focuses on generating high quality facial details synchronized with the audio.

The pipeline uses a proposed multi-modal controlled video generation network (MVControlNet) which has two branches: (i) a video diffusion branch for generating video content, conditioned on latent audio/identity representations (ii) a control branch for conditioning on video-based signals like landmarks through a ControlNet-style architecture.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces a practical novel setting for in-context talking face video generation.

- Proposes a two-stage landmark-conditioned generation pipeline and MVControlNet architecture that achieves spatial-temporal coherence for the task.

- Achieves higher audio-visual synchronization, video fidelity and spatial coherence compared to baselines like ControlNet and talking head synthesis methods.

- Demonstrates the ability to generate realistic and diverse talking faces fitting seamlessly into context videos.

In summary, the paper explores an interesting direction to make talking face generation more practical by considering visual context, through an effective landmark-based generation pipeline.
