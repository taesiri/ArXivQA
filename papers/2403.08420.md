## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper documents Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template for journal article submissions. The template is designed to help authors format their manuscripts according to the guidelines of CAS (Compendex and Scopus) journals. 

The paper first introduces the template, including the class files cas-sc.cls for single column and cas-dc.cls for double column layouts. It then covers different aspects of formatting the front matter, including the title, authors, affiliations, abstract, keywords, and other special marks. 

For the title, commands like \title, \tnotemark and \tnotetext allow adding a title, notes and text for the notes. For authors, \author, \fnmark, \ead, \cormark and other commands add author names, marks, emails, and specify corresponding authorship. The abstract and keywords are entered in dedicated environments. Special \nonumnote command allows adding notes without marks.

The document then covers formatting aspects of the main text, including sections, tables, figures, theorems, lists, biography section and bibliographic references. For theorems, predefined environments like theorem, definition and proof are available. Lists can be enumerated with customizations. The biography section is added with \bio command and references are formatted using BibTeX.

In all, the template allows formatting CAS journal articles effectively to submit in Elsevier Editorial System or elsewhere. The paper serves as a handy reference for using the CAS templates.
