# [$H$-Consistency Guarantees for Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19480)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies consistency guarantees (specifically $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds) for using surrogate loss functions instead of the squared loss in regression problems. Prior work has studied Bayes-consistency, but those results do not take into account the hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$. $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds are more informative, hypothesis set-specific and provide finite sample guarantees. However, such analysis has not been done for regression problems previously.

Proposed Solution:
The paper first generalizes existing tools for proving $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds to make them applicable in the regression setting. These generalized tools allow for non-constant bounding functions, which is necessary for losses like Huber loss or squared epsilon-insensitive loss.

Using the generalized tools, the paper proves a series of novel $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds w.r.t squared loss for common regression surrogate losses like Huber loss, $\ell_p$ losses, squared epsilon-insensitive loss etc. under the assumption of a symmetric, bounded distribution and hypothesis set. The bounds quantify the impact of estimation error using the surrogate on the target squared loss.

Additionally, the paper leverage the analysis to introduce smooth adversarial regression losses that explicitly trade-off between standard and adversarial accuracy. This gives rise to new algorithms for adversarial regression.

Main Contributions:
- Generalized existing tools for proving $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds to enable analysis in the regression setting
- First finite sample $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for regression losses like Huber, $\ell_p$, squared $\epsilon$-insensitive losses etc. 
- Introduced smooth adversarial regression losses by trading-off surrogate $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds and adversarial robustness
- Reported improved adversarial regression performance using the new algorithms

The analysis acts as a precursor and aids future studies of consistency guarantees for other surrogate losses w.r.t. different target losses in regression.
