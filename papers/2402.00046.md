# [Introducing PetriRL: An Innovative Framework for JSSP Resolution   Integrating Petri nets and Event-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Quality scheduling in industrial job shops is crucial for flexibility and efficiency. Job shop scheduling problems (JSSP) involve scheduling a set of jobs through different machines, where each job has a sequence of operations to be processed on specific machines. Solving JSSPs optimally is computationally intractable for large instances. Although neural networks can effectively solve JSSPs, their black-box nature and limited explainability hinder widespread industrial adoption.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces PetriRL, an innovative framework that combines Petri nets and reinforcement learning to solve JSSPs. Petri nets serve as both a graphical modelling tool to represent the job shop for enhanced explainability, and a control tool to govern automated parts of the process. An actor-critic reinforcement learning agent focuses on critical decision-making of resource allocation. Key elements include:

- Petri nets eliminate preprocessing of JSSP instances into graphs, allow direct raw data input. 
- Event-based control and action masking enhance efficiency.
- Advantage estimation using makespan projection enables consistent credit assignment.
- Object-oriented modelling provides flexibility to dynamically add operations.

Main Contributions:

- Explainability improved through Petri net's graphical modelling of job shop.
- Flexibility due to graph-based nature, which enables real-time addition of operations without retraining.  
- Efficiency gained via event-based control and action masking to reduce agent interactions.
- Generalization demonstrated across instance sizes, including a single "global" agent.
- Ablation study validates importance of key innovations like action masking.
- Competitive performance shown against wide range of optimization methods.

In summary, PetriRL offers an efficient, flexible and explainable solution to JSSPs that enhances industrial applicability of reinforcement learning.
