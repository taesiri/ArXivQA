## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Describing the real-time dynamics of non-equilibrium many-electron quantum systems is crucial for applications in quantum chemistry, materials science, etc. However, capturing the time evolution of such correlated quantum systems is very challenging due to the vast configuration space the system explores. Commonly used mean-field approximations like time-dependent Hartree-Fock fail to capture electron correlations. There is a need for accurate and efficient methods to simulate the dynamics of correlated quantum systems.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a variational approach to capture the time-dependent wavefunction of interacting fermions, going beyond mean-field approximations. The key ideas are:

1) Parameterize the time-evolving quantum state using a flexible ansatz with time-dependent parameters. This reduces the problem to finding the optimal parameters over time.

2) Use time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations in the ansatz to incorporate electron correlations. Optionally, represent these using neural networks. 

3) Employ the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) technique to efficiently compute the optimal parameters by stochastic sampling.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of tVMC with correlated wavefunctions to capture real-time electron dynamics in continuous space, demonstrated on various systems.

- Introduction of time-dependent neural network quantum states, using backflow and Jastrow transformations, to accurately represent correlations.

- Applications to the solvable harmonic interaction model, molecules in intense laser fields, and quenched quantum dots. Clear signatures of electron correlations captured, beyond mean-field methods.

- Showcase the capability of the variational approach to provide insights into quantum dynamics of interacting fermions, with potential impact on ab initio quantum chemistry and condensed matter simulations.

In summary, the paper introduces a promising, accurate and efficient variational technique for time-dependent electronic structure theory, capturing strong correlations in quantum dynamics through stochastic sampling.
