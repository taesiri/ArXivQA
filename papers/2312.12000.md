# [Diffusing More Objects for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Less   Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised domain adaptation for object detection, specifically when there is a large domain gap between the source domain (training data) and target domain (test data). As an example, the source domain is everyday frontal view images from MS-COCO, while the target domain is aerial view images from drones in VisDrone. The domain gap causes a significant performance drop due to differences in viewpoint, scale, motion blur, etc. The goal is to improve object detection performance on the target domain in a semi-supervised manner, using limited target domain labels.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes two main contributions:

1. A stochastic accumulator to improve object detections by exploiting the stochasticity of a diffusion-based object detection model (DiffusionDet). By accumulating multiple runs with different random initializations, the probability of detecting hard or small objects is increased.

2. A weighted pseudo-label loss for semi-supervised learning. The improved detections from the stochastic accumulator are used as pseudo-labels on unlabeled target domain images. A weighted loss is used during training that takes into account the confidences of the pseudo-labels, thereby reducing the effect of noisy labels.

Main Contributions:
- Showing that accumulating multiple stochastic runs of DiffusionDet improves detection performance, especially for small objects. This is useful for domain gaps where object scales change.

- Demonstrating that the improved detections can be successfully used as pseudo-labels for effective semi-supervised domain adaptation, using a weighted loss function. This achieves similar performance as human-verified pseudo-labels without manual verification.

- The proposed solutions (stochastic accumulator and weighted loss) together provide significant object detection improvements on the aerial view VisDrone dataset, reducing the domain gap from the frontal view MS-COCO source dataset.

In summary, the paper introduces two innovations to effectively adapt an object detector to a target domain with limited labels, leveraging diffusion model stochasticity and weighted semi-supervised learning.
