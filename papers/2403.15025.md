# [Robust Conformal Prediction under Distribution Shift via   Physics-Informed Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Conformal prediction (CP) provides prediction sets that cover the true label with at least $(1-\alpha)$ confidence, even when the marginal input distributions $P_X$ differ between calibration and test data. However, when the conditional label distributions $P_{Y|X}$ also differ, the coverage guarantee no longer holds. It is important to measure and minimize this coverage loss at all confidence levels under distribution shift.

Proposed Solution: 
1) Theoretically quantify coverage difference and calculate its upper bound based on the divergence between the cumulative density functions (CDFs) of calibration and test conformal scores.

2) Use Wasserstein distance to integrate the upper bound over all confidence levels to provide a comprehensive evaluation of domain adaptation generalization error of a conformal predictor.

3) Propose a physics-informed structural causal model (PI-SCM) to improve models' domain adaptation ability by capturing physical causality between variables. PI-SCM introduces more causality and thus reduces coverage divergence when test domain shifts.

Main Contributions:
1) Quantify coverage divergence and its upper bound using CDFs of conformal scores 

2) Apply Wasserstein distance as an integrator of coverage divergence over all confidence levels

3) Propose PI-SCM to reduce models' domain generalization error by capturing physical causality, thus improving coverage robustness

4) Validate PI-SCM can reduce coverage divergence and improve robustness in traffic speed and epidemic spread prediction tasks with real-world datasets

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical analysis of conformal prediction's coverage loss under distribution shift, and proposes PI-SCM to minimize this loss by capturing physical causality between variables. The effectiveness of PI-SCM is shown on real-world case studies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a physics-informed structural causal model to improve the coverage robustness of conformal prediction sets across different confidence levels and test distributions by capturing more underlying causal relationships between variables.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a physics-informed structural causal model (PI-SCM) to improve the coverage robustness of conformal prediction sets under distribution shift. Specifically:

1. It theoretically quantifies the coverage divergence between the actual coverage on test data and the expected coverage based on weighted calibration data. It then uses Wasserstein distance to evaluate this divergence comprehensively across confidence levels.

2. It proposes the PI-SCM framework to reduce the Wasserstein distance and coverage divergence by capturing more physical causality between variables. This improves the model's ability to generalize across domains.

3. It validates PI-SCM on traffic speed prediction and epidemic spread forecast tasks using real-world datasets. The results show PI-SCM can reduce coverage divergence and improve robustness across confidence levels and test domains compared to baseline models.

In summary, the key innovation is using physical/causal relationships within a model to make conformal prediction sets more robust to distribution shifts, as measured by the proposed coverage divergence and Wasserstein distance metrics. This addresses an important challenge in applying conformal prediction in real-world settings.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method quantify the coverage divergence theoretically? Explain the mathematical formulations used to calculate the upper bound of coverage difference and the intuition behind using cumulative density functions and Wasserstein distance. 

2. What is the core motivation behind proposing a Physics-Informed Structural Causal Model (PI-SCM) in this work? Explain how it helps reduce the coverage divergence through capturing more physical causality.

3. What assumptions need to be satisfied for the Joint Causal Inference in the proposed PI-SCM? Explain the Exogeneity Assumption and Randomization Assumption.

8. What is the trend in coverage divergence along different confidence levels that is observed consistently across experiments? Analyze the reasons behind seeing higher divergence in the middle range of confidence levels.

9. How does incorporating physical relationships through PI-SCM also aid in improving prediction accuracy? Explain if slight gains can still signal effectiveness.
