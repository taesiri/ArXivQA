# [Unifying Graph Contrastive Learning via Graph Message Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unifying Graph Contrastive Learning via Graph Message Augmentation":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on large labeled datasets for supervised training, which can be scarce or noisy in many applications. Contrastive self-supervised learning has emerged as an effective approach for GNNs to learn from unlabeled graph data.
- A key component of graph contrastive learning is graph data augmentation (GDA). Many GDA techniques have been developed, including dropping/perturbing nodes, edges, node/edge attributes. However, existing GDAs are tailored for specific types of graphs and tasks. There lacks a universal and effective GDA suitable for diverse graphs.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Graph Message Augmentation (GMA) framework that unifies different GDA techniques. 
- It represents a graph using graph messages - information passed from neighboring nodes. GMA performs dropping, perturbation, mixup on graph messages to augment data.
- GMA provides a universal formulation to unify many existing GDAs, giving new perspectives to understand them. It also enables mixup augmentation on graphs.
- Based on GMA, the paper develops a Graph Message Contrastive Learning (GMCL) approach for self-supervised graph representation learning.
- An Attribution-guided Graph Message Augmentor (AttGMA) is further proposed to learn to preserve label-related information in augmentation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes graph message augmentation (GMA) as a universal framework to unify different graph data augmentation techniques.
- Derives graph message mixup, an intuitive mixup operation for graph augmentation and contrastive learning.
- Develops a unified Graph Message Contrastive Learning (GMCL) approach using GMA for self-supervised graph representation learning. 
- Designs an attribution-guided adaptive augmentor to capture label-invariant information in augmentation.
- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on various graph learning tasks. Demonstrates effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches.
