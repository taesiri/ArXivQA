# [Template Free Reconstruction of Human-object Interaction with Procedural   Interaction Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07063)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for reconstructing 3D humans and objects interacting together from a single RGB image, without requiring any predefined object templates. The key idea is to procedurally generate a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1 million human-object interaction pairs with diverse objects, called ProciGen. This allows training a hierarchical diffusion model called HDM that first jointly reconstructs human and object points, then refines them separately while preserving interaction cues via cross-attention. HDM outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods like CHORE and PC^2 on datasets like BEHAVE and InterCap. More importantly, training purely on the synthetic ProciGen dataset allows HDM to generalize very well to unseen objects in wild images, demonstrating its ability to reconstruct interactions without any templates. ProciGen and HDM move a significant step closer to reconstructing unconstrained human-object interactions in the wild.
