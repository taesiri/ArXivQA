# [Not All Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04692)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an effective dropout method for self-attention based pre-trained language models to alleviate overfitting and enable more robust task-specific tuning. The key points are:- Self-attention networks are prone to co-adaptation and overfitting due to the severe dependencies between attention elements. Existing dropout methods like vanilla dropout are not effective enough for self-attention models.- The authors propose a novel dropout method called AttendOut that uses self-attention to dynamically generate dropout patterns for each attention layer and sample in an end-to-end manner. - AttendOut consists of three modules: Defender, Attacker, and Generator. The Generator learns to generate dropout masks by being rewarded when the Attacker model outperforms the Defender model on a task.- Experiments on various NLP datasets show AttendOut consistently improves strong BERT and RoBERTa models across different tasks by alleviating overfitting. The learned dropout patterns are shown to be task-specific and dynamic.In summary, the paper introduces AttendOut, a novel and effective dropout technique tailored for self-attention models, to address the limitation of existing dropout methods and enable more robust fine-tuning. The core idea is leveraging self-attention itself to guide the dropout.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel dropout method called AttendOut for self-attention based pre-trained language models. AttendOut uses a learnable generator network to dynamically generate dropout masks for the attention layers in an end-to-end manner. - The dropout masks are optimized through a policy gradient method based on the relative performance between two identical models - one with default dropout (Defender) and one with AttendOut dropout (Attacker). The generator network is rewarded when the Attacker outperforms the Defender.- Demonstrating the effectiveness of AttendOut for more robust task-specific tuning across a variety of NLP tasks. Experiments show consistent and significant performance improvements by applying AttendOut to BERT and RoBERTa.- Providing visual analysis of the learned dropout patterns, which show dataset-dependent and layer-dependent characteristics. The patterns also empirically validate the necessity of dynamic attention dropout.- Proposing two additional attention regularizers motivated by insights from AttendOut, which can provide effective performance boost without extra cost.In summary, the key contribution is presenting AttendOut as an end-to-end learnable and dynamic dropout method for self-attention models, which helps address overfitting and improves fine-tuning performance. The results validate AttendOut's universality across diverse NLP tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable dropout method called AttendOut that leverages self-attention to dynamically generate task-specific dropout patterns for each attention layer and sample, enabling more robust tuning and stronger performance on natural language processing tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related work:- The paper focuses specifically on attention dropout methods for pre-trained language models based on self-attention networks like BERT and RoBERTa. Much prior work on dropout has focused on other model architectures like CNNs or RNNs. - The proposed AttendOut method generates dynamic, sample-dependent dropout masks for each attention layer using a learned policy network. This differs from prior dropout techniques like vanilla dropout or scheduled dropout that use fixed random masks.- Most prior work on attention dropout uses simple random dropout on attention weights. This paper explores the less common scores dropout and shows it is more effective for self-attention models.- The paper demonstrates SOTA results on multiple NLP tasks by adding AttendOut to BERT and RoBERTa, showing the universality of the approach. Prior attention dropout methods are often evaluated on just one or two tasks.- The end-to-end trained AttendOut method allows optimizing the dropout policy via the model's own training loss. Other methods like search-based dropout depend on a separate validation set.- The visual analysis of learned dropout patterns provides insights into how much dropout is needed per layer. Lower layers tend to need more dropout, while higher layers need less.Overall, this paper makes noteworthy contributions by developing an end-to-end trainable, dynamic attention dropout technique tailored for self-attention based language models. The strong empirical results across multiple tasks validate the effectiveness of the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring different architectures for the generator network G-Net, such as using multiple attention heads or adding feedforward layers, to see if they can learn better dropout patterns.- Applying AttendOut during pre-training of language models, instead of just during fine-tuning, to impart robustness from the start. However, the computational overhead may be prohibitive.- Extending AttendOut beyond natural language processing tasks to other domains like computer vision where attention mechanisms are also widely used.- Trying different reward functions or training procedures for G-Net to optimize the learned dropout patterns.- Analyzing the dropout patterns in more detail to try to understand what linguistic or structural properties the attention heads are capturing.- Combining AttendOut with other regularization techniques like adversarial training or representation masking.- Developing theoretical understandings of why and how AttendOut improves model robustness.So in summary, the authors point to several promising directions like architectural improvements to G-Net, applying AttendOut more broadly, analyzing the learned patterns, combining with other techniques, and developing theory. Overall the focus is on better understanding, extending, and improving AttendOut.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes AttendOut, a novel dropout method for self-attention networks in pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa. AttendOut uses a trainable module called the generator to dynamically generate dropout patterns for each attention layer and sample during training. The generator is trained via policy gradient to maximize the difference in performance between the model with AttendOut (attacker) and without (defender). Experiments on GLUE, IMDB, CoNLL, PTB, and SWAG show AttendOut consistently improves results over strong BERT and RoBERTa baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for more robust task-specific tuning. Analyses reveal the dropout patterns differ across tasks and layers in an intuitive way. The paper also proposes approximating these patterns with a scheduled Bernoulli dropout, which also boosts performance, validating the learned dynamic dropout.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel dropout method called AttendOut for pre-trained language models like BERT that use self-attention. The key idea is to leverage self-attention itself to dynamically generate sample-dependent dropout patterns for each attention layer during task-specific fine-tuning. This is done by having three modules - a defender model with default dropout, an attacker model with extra dropout from a generator, and the generator model that produces the dropout masks. The generator model is trained with policy gradient to maximize the difference in performance between the defender and attacker. Experiments on GLUE, document classification, NER, POS tagging, and QA datasets show AttendOut consistently improves performance over default BERT and RoBERTa, especially on smaller datasets prone to overfitting. Analysis of the learned dropout patterns reveals they differ across tasks but generally apply higher dropout to lower layers. The method also converges faster and more stably than default models.In summary, this paper introduces AttendOut, a novel method to dynamically generate optimized dropout patterns for self-attention layers in pre-trained language models. AttendOut leverages self-attention itself to produce sample-dependent masks that mitigate overfitting. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains across diverse NLP tasks compared to standard dropout. The learned patterns help models generalize better by selectively dropping less useful attention. This provides a way to further improve existing strong pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa.
