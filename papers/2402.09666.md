# [EntailE: Introducing Textual Entailment in Commonsense Knowledge Graph   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "EntailE: Introducing Textual Entailment in Commonsense Knowledge Graph Completion":

Problem:
- Commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs) like ConceptNet and ATOMIC are critical for AI systems to have human-level understanding. However, they are highly incomplete and sparse. 
- Existing knowledge graph completion methods struggle with CSKGs due to the complexity of representing named entities, phrases, and events as nodes and the sparse graph structure.
- Prior works have used graph densification and synthetic edges to address sparsity, but do not sufficiently capture the semantic plausibility between nodes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce textual entailment to model semantic plausibility between CSKG nodes and find implicit entailment relations.
- Use a transformer fined-tuned on NLI task to extract embeddings and entailment scores for node pairs. Nodes with high scores are plausibly related.
- Construct synthetic triplets by transferring triplets from source nodes to their entailed nodes to densify the CSKG.
- Add an entity contrast module to push apart unrelated nodes and bring related nodes closer in the embedding space.

Main Contributions:
- Adopt textual entailment and semantic plausibility to find implicit correlations between CSKG nodes in various forms like named entities, phrases, and events.
- Propose synthetic triplets from source nodes to entailed nodes to densify CSKGs and enhance representation learning.
- Design an entity contrast module to utilize entailment relations for better node representations.
- Experiments show improved performance on CSKG completion under both transductive and inductive settings on ConceptNet and ATOMIC datasets.

In summary, this paper introduces textual entailment to model semantic plausibility for CSKG completion via graph densification and representation learning, outperforming previous works. The key innovation is using NLI embeddings to connect related nodes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes introducing textual entailment relations between commonsense knowledge graph nodes to densify the graphs with synthetic edges and improve node representation learning, which enhances performance on commonsense knowledge graph completion tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing to adopt textual entailment to model the semantic plausibility between commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) nodes. This helps explore the implicit correlation between nodes to address the sparsity problem in CSKGs.

2. Proposing to conduct CSKG completion with synthetic triplets constructed by transferring triplets from source nodes to their entailed nodes. This densifies the CSKGs and benefits representation learning to improve CSKG completion performance. 

3. Proposing an entity contrast module to utilize the entailment relations to facilitate entity embedding learning, avoiding noise from the synthetic triplets. This mainly contributes to inductive CSKG completion.

In summary, the key contribution is using textual entailment to model semantic plausibility between nodes, construct synthetic triplets to densify the graphs, and design an entity contrast module. This improves performance on CSKG completion, especially for the inductive setting.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to use textual entailment to model semantic plausibility between CSKG nodes. Why is textual entailment well-suited for this task compared to other semantic similarity metrics? What are the limitations?

2. The paper extracts entailment relations by fine-tuning a transformer model on natural language inference (NLI) datasets. What are some key challenges in adapting NLI models to extract quality entailment relations from CSKG nodes?  

3. The synthetic triplets are created by transferring triplets from a node to its entailed nodes. What could be some downsides of creating synthetic triplets in this manner? How does the paper attempt to address potential issues?

4. Could you further analyze the differences in performance between the transductive and inductive evaluation settings? Why does entity contrast help more for the inductive setting?

5. The ablation studies analyze the impact of various hyperparameters like $k_1$, $k_2$, etc. What trends can you observe regarding these parameters? How would you determine optimal values for a new CSKG graph?  

6. How does the performance compare on the two CSKG benchmarks used in the paper - CN-82K and ATOMIC? What differences in the graph structure or nodes could account for differences seen?

7. The paper mentions underestimation issues where reasonable predictions are not present in the labeled test set. How could the evaluation be enhanced to account for multiple plausible tails for a given head and relation?  

8. What types of nodes and relations are likely to benefit the most from the densification method proposed? What limitations exist?

9. The method relies on an NLI fine-tuned transformer model. How would the overall approach change if using different base transformer architectures? What is essential for the NLI fine-tuning?

10. How could the ideas proposed here be integrated with existing encoder-decoder CSKG completion frameworks? What components would be reused and what would need enhancement?
