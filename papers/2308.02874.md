# [Sketch and Text Guided Diffusion Model for Colored Point Cloud   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02874)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate colored 3D point clouds from hand-drawn sketches and text descriptions. The key hypothesis is that by conditioning a diffusion model jointly on sketch and text inputs, the model can generate high quality geometry and appearance for 3D shapes.Specifically, the paper proposes a "sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model" called STPD that takes a sketch and text description as inputs and generates a colored point cloud representing the 3D shape described. The core ideas are:- Using a diffusion process to iteratively add noise to point coordinates and colors, reaching a Gaussian distribution, then learning a reverse diffusion process conditioned on sketch + text to recover the shape.- Designing a sparse feature extraction network to encode sketches, using capsule networks and attention routing, since sketches are sparse compared to natural images. - Fusing sketch and text features using a multi-head attention mechanism to extract shape and color information from both modalities.- A staged diffusion process to first generate geometry then appearance conditioned on the shape.The central hypothesis is that by conditioning the diffusion on both sketch and text, where sketch provides more shape detail and text provides appearance, the model can generate colored 3D point clouds that closely match the desired specifications provided in the inputs. Experiments on ShapeNet show the model outperforms recent methods in generating shapes faithful to input sketches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model for colored point cloud generation. The key points are:- They propose a staged probabilistic diffusion model to generate 3D shape geometry and appearance (color) from sketch and text inputs. This allows better control over the shape and appearance generation compared to joint diffusion models.- They introduce a sparse feature extraction network for sketch embedding based on a capsule network with attention routing. This handles the inherent sparsity in hand drawn sketches compared to natural images. - They present a sketch-text fusion network to efficiently combine and extract shape and color information from both the sketch and text descriptions. This guides the diffusion process.- Their model performs diffusion jointly on point coordinates and colors, and generates the 3D geometry in the first stage followed by appearance in the second stage.- Experiments on ShapeNet dataset show their model outperforms recent diffusion-based 3D generation methods as well as classical sketch and text based reconstruction methods in generating colored point clouds.In summary, the key contribution is a staged sketch and text conditioned diffusion model for colored 3D point cloud generation, with a focus on effectively encoding the sparse sketch and fusing it with text.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a novel sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model for generating colored 3D point clouds that conditions the denoising process on both a hand drawn sketch and textual description to iteratively recover the desired shape and color.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in 3D shape generation:- Uses diffusion models for 3D shape generation: Diffusion models have become very popular for 2D image generation, but their use for 3D shape generation is still relatively new. This paper builds off recent works like DPM and PVD that first explored diffusion models for unconditional 3D shape generation.- Combines sketch and text inputs: Most prior work has focused on either sketch-based or text-based 3D shape generation. Using both sketch and text as inputs provides complementary shape information to guide the diffusion process. This is a novel combination in the literature.- Two-stage diffusion for geometry and appearance: The paper proposes a two-stage diffusion process, first generating the shape geometry followed by appearance/coloring. This provides more control compared to joint diffusion of geometry and color. - Attention-based sketch feature extraction: To deal with the sparsity of sketch inputs, the paper proposes a capsule attention network to focus on the relevant sketch features. This is tailored to the nature of sketch inputs.- Evaluates on colored point cloud generation: Most prior work focused only on shape generation. This paper tackles the harder problem of jointly generating geometry and appearance as colored point clouds.- Achieves state-of-the-art results: The paper demonstrates superior quantitative results compared to prior sketch, text, and diffusion-based 3D generation methods on standard datasets.In summary, the key novelty is the combination of sketches and text to guide diffusion for colored point cloud generation, enabled by a two-stage process and sketch-specific feature extraction. The strong results validate the approach over existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Training the model on larger 3D shape datasets with detailed text descriptions to improve generalization ability and allow generating more diverse and complex shapes. The authors note their model was only trained on a subset of ShapeNet, which limits what it can generate.- Exploring different model architectures and diffusion strategies to allow controlling more aspects of shape generation, like structure and topology. The authors' staged diffusion primarily controls geometry and appearance. - Extending the model for generating animated shapes and scenes, not just static point clouds. The authors note their model could potentially be adapted for dynamic scene generation.- Improving sketch understanding and abstraction to handle more varied, complex, and even conflicting sketch inputs. The authors note their model sometimes struggles with conflicting sketch-text inputs.- Combining the sketch-text inputs with other modalities like images or videos to provide even more shape context. The authors currently fuse sketch and text only.- Adapting the model for interactive or iterative shape editing and refinement based on user feedback. This could improve usability.- Exploring the use of transformer architectures which have shown promise for generative modeling of images and videos. The authors use CNNs and capsule networks currently.So in summary, the main suggested future work relates to improvements in datasets, model architecture, input modalities, shape control, and interactivity to make the system more robust and useful.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model for generating colored 3D point clouds. It takes a hand drawn sketch and text description as input to guide the diffusion process for generating geometry and appearance. The model performs diffusion jointly on point coordinates and colors, incrementally adding noise to reach a Gaussian distribution. Generating the point cloud then involves learning to reverse this diffusion process conditioned on the sketch and text. Specifically, the model first generates the geometry using sketch and any shape information from text. It then freezes the geometry and generates appearance conditioned on the text description and generated geometry. To encode the sparse sketch, a capsule attention network is proposed. The sketch and text features are then fused using a cascaded multi-head attention module. Experiments on ShapeNet show the model achieves state-of-the-art colored point cloud generation. The learned representations are also useful for 3D classification and part segmentation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model for colored point cloud generation. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, the authors propose to incrementally diffuse the point coordinates and color values jointly to reach a Gaussian distribution. Colored point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process, conditioned by the sketch and text, to iteratively recover the desired shape and color. Specifically, the model takes a hand drawn sketch and text description as input to condition the denoising of 3D shapes. It extracts features from both modalities using a capsule attention network for the sketch and BERT for the text. These features are fused using a multi-head attention mechanism. The model then performs staged diffusion, first generating the geometry and then assigning colors to different object parts conditioned on the text description. This gives it flexibility for applications like appearance re-editing and part segmentation. Experiments on ShapeNet show state-of-the-art performance in colored point cloud generation compared to existing diffusion-based models. The model also shows promising results for 3D object classification on ModelNet and part segmentation on ShapeNet-Parts.In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions: 1) A sketch and text conditioned diffusion model for colored point cloud generation; 2) A capsule attention network for robust sketch feature extraction; 3) A multi-head attention based sketch-text fusion module; 4) Staged diffusion for sequential geometry and appearance generation; 5) State-of-the-art results on ShapeNet for colored point cloud generation, ModelNet for 3D classification, and ShapeNet-Parts for part segmentation. The proposed model offers better shape generation conditioned on sketch-text inputs compared to existing diffusion models.
