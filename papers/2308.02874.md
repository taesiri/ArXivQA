# [Sketch and Text Guided Diffusion Model for Colored Point Cloud   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02874)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate colored 3D point clouds from hand-drawn sketches and text descriptions. The key hypothesis is that by conditioning a diffusion model jointly on sketch and text inputs, the model can generate high quality geometry and appearance for 3D shapes.Specifically, the paper proposes a "sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model" called STPD that takes a sketch and text description as inputs and generates a colored point cloud representing the 3D shape described. The core ideas are:- Using a diffusion process to iteratively add noise to point coordinates and colors, reaching a Gaussian distribution, then learning a reverse diffusion process conditioned on sketch + text to recover the shape.- Designing a sparse feature extraction network to encode sketches, using capsule networks and attention routing, since sketches are sparse compared to natural images. - Fusing sketch and text features using a multi-head attention mechanism to extract shape and color information from both modalities.- A staged diffusion process to first generate geometry then appearance conditioned on the shape.The central hypothesis is that by conditioning the diffusion on both sketch and text, where sketch provides more shape detail and text provides appearance, the model can generate colored 3D point clouds that closely match the desired specifications provided in the inputs. Experiments on ShapeNet show the model outperforms recent methods in generating shapes faithful to input sketches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model for colored point cloud generation. The key points are:- They propose a staged probabilistic diffusion model to generate 3D shape geometry and appearance (color) from sketch and text inputs. This allows better control over the shape and appearance generation compared to joint diffusion models.- They introduce a sparse feature extraction network for sketch embedding based on a capsule network with attention routing. This handles the inherent sparsity in hand drawn sketches compared to natural images. - They present a sketch-text fusion network to efficiently combine and extract shape and color information from both the sketch and text descriptions. This guides the diffusion process.- Their model performs diffusion jointly on point coordinates and colors, and generates the 3D geometry in the first stage followed by appearance in the second stage.- Experiments on ShapeNet dataset show their model outperforms recent diffusion-based 3D generation methods as well as classical sketch and text based reconstruction methods in generating colored point clouds.In summary, the key contribution is a staged sketch and text conditioned diffusion model for colored 3D point cloud generation, with a focus on effectively encoding the sparse sketch and fusing it with text.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a novel sketch and text guided probabilistic diffusion model for generating colored 3D point clouds that conditions the denoising process on both a hand drawn sketch and textual description to iteratively recover the desired shape and color.
