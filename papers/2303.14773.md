# [BlackVIP: Black-Box Visual Prompting for Robust Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14773)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

Can we efficiently adapt large pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks in a black-box setting where we do not have access to the model parameters or architecture?

The paper proposes a method called "black-box visual prompting" (BlackVIP) to address this question. The key ideas are:

- Use a small neural network called a "Coordinator" to generate input-dependent image-shaped visual prompts that are optimized to adapt the pre-trained model to the downstream task. This allows adaptation without accessing the pre-trained model internals.

- Use a zeroth-order optimization algorithm called "SPSA-GC" to update the Coordinator parameters based only on the outputs of the pre-trained model. This avoids needing access to gradients or model parameters. 

- Show that BlackVIP can efficiently adapt models like CLIP to diverse downstream datasets and improves over baselines, while requiring minimal parameters, memory, and API queries.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that input-dependent visual prompting along with zeroth-order optimization enables black-box adaptation of large pre-trained vision models without access to model internals. The paper aims to validate this hypothesis through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing BlackVIP, a novel black-box visual prompting method for efficient adaptation of pre-trained vision models without requiring parameter access or large memory. BlackVIP has two key components:

1) Coordinator - An input-dependent visual prompt generator based on an asymmetric autoencoder structure. It reparameterizes the visual prompt into a small neural network to enable optimization with few parameters. 

2) SPSA-GC - A new simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm with gradient correction for stable zeroth-order optimization of the Coordinator.

- Demonstrating that BlackVIP can improve model adaptation on diverse datasets and tasks like fine-grained recognition, counting, etc. without accessing model parameters.

- Showing that BlackVIP is architecture-agnostic and can work with different model backbones like CNNs and ViTs.

- Validating that BlackVIP improves few-shot model adaptation, and is robust to distribution shifts and object location changes compared to baselines.

- Highlighting that BlackVIP requires minimal compute resources in terms of parameters (9K vs 37K for baselines) and memory (2.4GB vs 11GB for baselines).

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an end-to-end black-box visual prompting framework via input-dependent prompt generation and efficient zeroth-order optimization that enables adapting vision models without parameter access or large memory.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes BlackVIP, a black-box visual prompting method that efficiently adapts pre-trained vision models to new tasks without accessing model parameters, using an input-dependent prompt generator and zeroth-order optimization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other related research:

- This paper introduces a new method called BlackVIP for fine-tuning large pre-trained models (PTMs) without access to the model parameters or architecture. This makes it novel compared to most prior work on adapting PTMs, which assumes white-box access to the full model. 

- The idea of using visual prompts (learnable perturbations on the input images) has been explored before in works like Visual Prompting (Bahng et al. 2022) and BAR (Tsai et al. 2020). However, BlackVIP makes the prompts input-dependent via a lightweight network called the Coordinator. This is a new contribution over prior work with fixed prompts.

- For optimizing the prompts without backpropagation access, the authors adapt the SPSA algorithm and propose a novel variant called SPSA-GC. Using zeroth-order optimization for PETL in a black-box setting is novel. Prior work either uses backpropagation or different zeroth-order methods.

- The extensive experiments on 16 diverse datasets demonstrate that BlackVIP outperforms baseline approaches like BAR and SPSA-adapted Visual Prompting. The comparisons to white-box Visual Prompting also analyze the trade-offs. This benchmarking on a wide range of tasks is more thorough than prior work.

- For the specific use case of adapting pre-trained vision-language models, this paper has similarities to works like CoOp (Zhou et al. 2022). But CoOp still assumes access to model gradients. So BlackVIP is uniquely motivated by real-world black-box transfer learning.

In summary, BlackVIP pushes the boundaries of PETL by tackling black-box adaptation and input-dependent prompting in a practical and robust way. The novel components and rigorous benchmarking make it a solid contribution compared to prior art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other encoder architectures besides MAE for the Coordinator module, such as other self-supervised methods or lightweight supervised networks. The authors suggest that the choice of encoder can impact the effectiveness and efficiency of BlackVIP.

- Extending BlackVIP to other tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection and segmentation. The authors propose that the conditional prompt design of BlackVIP could be beneficial for pixel-level tasks.

- Applying BlackVIP to very large models such as BERT and GPT-3. The authors suggest investigating how BlackVIP scales when adapting huge PTMs with billions of parameters.

- Exploring different zeroth-order optimization algorithms besides SPSA-GC. The authors propose evaluating other ZOO methods to further enhance the query efficiency and convergence speed. 

- Reducing the query cost of BlackVIP to enable broader adoption. The authors suggest developing approaches to make BlackVIP more query efficient.

- Evaluating BlackVIP on more diverse datasets and domains. The authors propose assessing BlackVIP on even more varied datasets to fully gauge its robustness and generalizability.

- Combining BlackVIP with architecture modification methods. The authors suggest exploring integrating BlackVIP with approaches that modify the target model architecture for potentially greater performance.

So in summary, the main future directions are developing variations of BlackVIP's core components, applying it to new tasks and models, further improving its efficiency, and evaluating it more extensively. The overall goal seems to be making BlackVIP more versatile, efficient, and widely usable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes BlackVIP, a black-box visual prompting method for robust transfer learning of pre-trained vision models. BlackVIP has two key components: 1) Coordinator, an autoencoder-style network that generates input-dependent image-shaped visual prompts by taking in the original image; 2) SPSA-GC, a new zeroth-order optimization algorithm that efficiently estimates gradients to update Coordinator without accessing model parameters. BlackVIP enables adapting pre-trained models to new tasks without requiring model access or large memory, achieving strong performance on few-shot learning benchmarks. Key advantages are input-dependent prompt design, architecture-agnostic learning, and robustness to distribution shift and location changes. BlackVIP demonstrates pre-trained model adaptation in realistic black-box scenarios with minimal resource requirements.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called BlackVIP for efficiently adapting large pre-trained models (PTMs) to new tasks in a black-box setting where the model parameters and architecture are not accessible. BlackVIP has two main components. The first is a lightweight neural network module called the Coordinator that generates input-dependent image-shaped visual prompts. The prompts are optimized to steer the frozen PTM to focus on the relevant parts of the input image for the target task. The second component is a variant of the SPSA black-box optimization algorithm called SPSA-GC. It estimates gradients and updates the small number of Coordinator parameters without backpropagating through the large PTM. 

Experiments demonstrate BlackVIP's effectiveness for few-shot learning on diverse vision tasks. Compared to prior input-space prompting methods like visual prompting and black-box adversarial reprogramming, BlackVIP achieves superior performance due to the input-dependent prompt design and improved optimization. Key benefits are that BlackVIP adapts black-box models with minimal parameters, memory, and queries. It also improves robustness to distribution shifts and object location changes compared to methods using fixed prompt designs. The results highlight the promise of black-box prompting for efficiently repurposing PTMs without model access.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called BlackVIP for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks in a black-box setting without access to model parameters. BlackVIP has two key components - a Coordinator module that generates input-dependent visual prompts by passing images through a frozen SSL encoder and lightweight decoder, and a SPSA-GC optimization algorithm that efficiently estimates gradients to update the Coordinator without backpropagation. Specifically, SPSA-GC approximates gradients by evaluating the model's output difference on perturbed inputs, and then corrects the estimates in a momentum-based manner inspired by Nesterov accelerated gradient. By combining the input-dependent prompt generation and efficient black-box optimization, BlackVIP enables robust adaptation of vision models to new tasks with minimal memory and parameters, without needing access to model internals.
