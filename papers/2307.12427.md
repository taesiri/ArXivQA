# [Augmented Box Replay: Overcoming Foreground Shift for Incremental Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How to enable experience replay methods like image replay to work effectively for incremental object detection (IOD)?The key hypothesis proposed is:The main reason image replay has not been successful for IOD is the problem of "foreground shift" that occurs when replaying images from previous tasks. Foreground shift refers to the fact that background regions of old images may contain foreground objects of current classes.To address this, the paper proposes a new method called Augmented Box Replay (ABR) that replays only foreground boxes from old images mixed into new images, avoiding the foreground shift issue. The paper hypothesizes that ABR will allow experience replay to improve IOD performance by enhancing model stability and plasticity.In summary, the central hypothesis is that foreground shift is the critical issue hampering image replay for IOD, and ABR can overcome this by replaying augmented boxes instead of full images, enabling replay to boost IOD performance. The experiments aim to validate whether ABR improves stability and plasticity compared to prior IOD techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Identifying the problem of foreground shift that occurs when replaying images for incremental object detection. The paper argues that this issue has hampered the application of replay methods in IOD. 2. Proposing a novel Augmented Box Replay (ABR) method to overcome the foreground shift issue. ABR stores and replays only bounding boxes from old classes rather than full images, avoiding the replay of unlabeled new objects. This improves model stability and plasticity.3. Introducing an Attentive ROI Distillation loss that aligns spatial attention maps and masked features of proposals to focus the model on important location and feature information from the old model. This further reduces catastrophic forgetting.4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of the proposed ABR method on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets across multiple incremental learning settings. The method shows significant gains especially on longer task sequences and when starting with a small initial task.5. Providing a foundation for box replay techniques as an alternative to traditional image/feature replay for incremental object detection. The paper also suggests implications for incremental semantic segmentation.In summary, the key novelty seems to be introducing box replay to overcome the foreground shift issue, combined with an attentive distillation loss. This enables effective replay for IOD and achieves superior incremental detection performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new incremental object detection method called Augmented Box Replay (ABR) that overcomes the problem of foreground shift during old image replay by storing and augmenting boxes from previous tasks, and introduces an Attentive RoI Distillation loss to focus the model on important location and feature information to further reduce catastrophic forgetting.
