# [Text2NeRF: Text-Driven 3D Scene Generation with Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11588)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate realistic and diverse 3D scenes purely from natural language descriptions, without requiring 3D supervision or paired text-3D data? The key points are:- The paper proposes Text2NeRF, a text-driven 3D scene generation framework that combines a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. - The goal is to generate high-quality 3D scenes with complex geometries and photorealistic textures directly from textual prompts, without needing additional 3D training data.- To achieve this, the paper leverages the image generation capabilities of diffusion models to provide image priors (both content and geometry) to guide the 3D reconstruction process using NeRF.- A progressive inpainting and updating strategy is introduced to expand the scene and maintain consistency across views during novel view synthesis.- Additional components like support sets, depth losses, and depth alignment are incorporated to enable generating complex scenes from scratch and handle issues like overfitting and depth estimation errors.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining the strengths of NeRF and diffusion models, the proposed Text2NeRF approach can enable zero-shot, text-driven generation of high-quality 3D scenes without 3D supervision. The experiments aim to validate this capability across diverse scene prompts.
