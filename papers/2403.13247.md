# [FedNMUT -- Federated Noisy Model Update Tracking Convergence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper addresses the challenge of imperfect information sharing due to communication noise in decentralized federated learning (DFL) frameworks. 
- Existing DFL methods do not properly account for the impact of noisy communications on model convergence.
- There is a need for DFL algorithms that are robust to communication noise to enable reliable learning across networks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel Decentralized Noisy Model Update Tracking Federated Learning algorithm (FedNMUT). 
- FedNMUT incorporates noise parameters to mimic real-world noisy channels and enables clients to reach consensus despite imperfect information exchange.  
- It employs gradient tracking to handle data heterogeneity while minimizing communication overhead.
- The algorithm shares model update information instead of gradients between clients.
- A scaling factor tunes the tracking variable to improve convergence. 
- Communication noise is added to the tracking variables before sharing.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces FedNMUT algorithm specifically designed to counter communication noise during decentralized learning.
- Provides theoretical analysis of FedNMUT under common assumptions, showing the impact of noise on the convergence bound.
- Derives convergence rate for smooth non-convex objectives in the presence of noise as $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$.
- Empirically demonstrates FedNMUT's superior resilience to noise compared to previous decentralized algorithms.
- Overall, proposes and validates an effective strategy to perform reliable DFL amidst imperfect information exchange due to noisy communications.

In summary, the paper presents FedNMUT, a novel DFL algorithm using model update tracking and strategic noise handling to enable robust decentralized learning under noisy conditions, backed by theoretical and empirical evidence.
