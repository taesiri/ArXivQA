# [LLM as OS, Agents as Apps: Envisioning AIOS, Agents and the AIOS-Agent   Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03815)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional operating systems (OS) lack intelligence and creative problem-solving abilities. Applications built on them are also limited. There is a need to infuse intelligence into the OS level and distribute it to applications.  

- Programming applications requires specialized skills. There is a need to democratize software development and make it more accessible.

Solution - AIOS and Agent Ecosystem:
- The paper envisions an Artificial Intelligent Operating System (AIOS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core. LLM serves as the "soul" of the OS.  

- A diverse range of intelligent LLM-based Agent Applications (AAPs) can be built on top of AIOS. This leads to an AIOS-Agent ecosystem, in contrast to the traditional OS-APP ecosystem.

- In the ecosystem, average users can program AAPs using natural language, without needing coding skills. This democratizes software development.

Key Concepts:
- LLM as OS (system level) - LLM is the kernel managing system resources
- Agents as Applications (application level) 
- Natural Language as Programming Interface (user level)
- Tools as Devices/Libraries (hardware/middleware level) 

Main Contributions:
- Proposes conceptual framework to understand LLM as OS (LLMOS) with components analogous to traditional OS
- Envisions AIOS-Agent ecosystem where agents can be easily developed on AIOS foundation using NL
- Explores single agent, multi-agent and human-agent applications based on LLMOS
- Draws parallels from evolution of traditional OS to provide strategic roadmap for future directions in development of AIOS and agents

The paper puts forth a visionary ecosystem powered by LLMOS that promises to revolutionize software development, task automation, decision making and human-computer interaction by making intelligent systems more accessible.
