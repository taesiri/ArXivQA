# [ESG Accountability Made Easy: DocQA at Your Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18481)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Deep Search DocQA, an AI-powered question answering system that enables users to extract information from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) disclosure reports. The system has an end-to-end pipeline consisting of: 1) Document Conversion - converts PDF reports into a machine-readable format using OCR and layout analysis; 2) Information Retrieval - encodes the text and tables into vectors to identify relevant passages for the user's question; and 3) Response Generation - uses large language models to generate an eloquent, grounded response to the question with supporting context from the document. The system currently covers over 10,000 ESG reports from over 2,000 corporations. Users can ask questions through a conversational assistant interface and receive automatically generated answers with relevant excerpts from the source reports. The paper discusses related work in ESG NLP analysis and large language models. The DocQA system integrates state-of-the-art AI to unlock insights from ESG reports at scale to benefit various stakeholders. Future work focuses on cross-document querying for trend analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a document question answering system called Deep Search DocQA that extracts information from ESG disclosure reports by converting PDFs to machine-readable format, retrieving relevant passages using vector embeddings, and generating responses with large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of the Deep Search DocQA system, which enables question-answering from ESG disclosure reports that are in PDF format. Specifically:

- They have developed an end-to-end pipeline to extract information from PDF documents, understand natural language questions, and generate responses using large language models. 

- The system integrates multiple AI technologies - document conversion from PDFs to machine readable format, information retrieval to find relevant passages, and language generation models to formulate answers.

- It provides an easy way for anyone to extract insights and information from a library of over 10,000 ESG reports spanning over 2000 corporations. 

- This is the first automated question-answering system focused on unlocking ESG data from disclosure reports, which is typically published in PDF format and not easily analyzable.

In summary, the main contribution is the Deep Search DocQA system itself, which enables extracting information from ESG disclosure reports via conversational question-answering.

The paper presents a system called Deep Search DocQA that can extract information from ESG reports in PDF format by allowing users to query the documents through a conversational question answering interface. The key components involve document conversion, information retrieval to find relevant passages, and using large language models to generate responses. Overall, it demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline to unlock data from unstructured ESG documents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The document conversion system uses an asynchronous task-based architecture. Can you explain in more detail how the tasks are distributed and coordinated between the different components? 

2. For information retrieval, vector embeddings of the text and tables are created. What encoder models have the authors experimented with and what were the tradeoffs they observed between different models?

3. The authors mention using a prompt-based approach with large language models like LLAMA 2 and Flan-UL2 for response generation. Can you provide more details on the prompt formulation and how it incorporates the user question and retrieved context? 

4. The paper talks about grounding the responses from the language model to avoid hallucinations. What techniques are used for grounding and how effective are they? 

5. How large is the labeled dataset used to train the layout analysis and table structure extraction models? What annotation process was followed to create this dataset?

6. Have the authors conducted an error analysis to identify the main failure modes of the document conversion pipeline? What are some of the key challenges?

7. For assembling the output from multiple pages while preserving reading order, what algorithms or heuristics are used? How robust are they to imperfect layout analysis?  

8. What evaluation metrics are used to compare different encoder models for information retrieval? Is there a tradeoff between precision and recall? 

9. How was the suite of language models selected for the final response generation component? Were certain models better suited for the ESG domain?

10. The paper focuses on ESG reports but mentions expandability to other documents. What adaptations would be needed to handle other document types like scientific papers or financial reports?
