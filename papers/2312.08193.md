# [Universal Adversarial Framework to Improve Adversarial Robustness for   Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08193)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for improving the robustness of deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy (DR) image classification. The authors use universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) to quantify model vulnerability and then leverage UAPs to perform adversarial training. Specifically, they pretrain seven state-of-the-art classifiers on the EyePACS2015 and APTOS2019 datasets comprising DR fundus images with five severity grades. After establishing strong baseline performance, they generate UAPs for each model and craft adversarial datasets. Testing on these adversarial datasets shows significant performance degradation, indicating vulnerability. To improve robustness, they adversarially fine-tune each model on the dataset perturbed by its own UAP. After fine-tuning, models show boosted performance on both seen and unseen perturbations, with ensemble strategies further improving robustness. Significance testing confirms the performance gains are statistically significant. This UAP-based adversarial training approach is task-agnostic and demonstrates effectiveness for hardening models against adversarial attacks, enabling reliable DR grading vital for healthcare applications. Key results show ensemble strategies can improve quadratic Cohen kappa similarity to clinician scores by over 0.8 on average.
