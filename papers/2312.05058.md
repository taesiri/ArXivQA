# [Spatial and Temporal Hierarchy for Autonomous Navigation using Active   Inference in Minigrid Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05058)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a hierarchical active inference model for autonomous navigation consisting of three layers operating at different timescales: a cognitive map for global topological representation and planning, an allocentric model for place-based scene representations, and an egocentric model for short-term dynamics modeling. Leveraging principles from biology and cognitive science, this model aims to achieve efficient exploration and goal-directed navigation in complex environments. The model utilizes pixel-based visual observations to learn spatial layouts and relationships. Through curiosity-driven information seeking balanced with goal-oriented planning, the agent can navigate environments it has never seen before. Experiments in mini-grid worlds demonstrate the model's ability to rapidly characterize rooms, resolve aliasing, construct accurate cognitive maps, and accomplish competitive exploration and goal reaching compared to state-of-the-art RL techniques. The hierarchical structure enhances efficiency and scalability while reducing computational demands. By combining active inference and hierarchical world models, this approach offers a promising architecture for adaptable agents that can autonomously navigate new spaces.
