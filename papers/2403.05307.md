# [Tapilot-Crossing: Benchmarking and Evolving LLMs Towards Interactive   Data Analysis Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05307)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interactive data analysis between humans and AI agents enables real-time data exploration for decision making. However, collecting realistic interactive logs is challenging and costly.  
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating interactive data analysis agents are limited in scope and practicality.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces Tapilot-Crossing, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on interactive data analysis across 4 modes: Normal, Action, Private, Private Action.
- Constructs the benchmark efficiently using a novel multi-agent environment called Decision Company.
- Evaluates popular LLMs on Tapilot-Crossing, highlighting capability gaps.  
- Proposes Adaptive Interaction Reflection (AIR) to guide LLMs to learn from successful history.

Main Contributions:
- Tapilot-Crossing benchmark with 1024 interactions covering practical scenarios. Constructed economically using Decision Company.
- Evaluation of LLMs on Tapilot-Crossing, underscoring challenges of interactive analysis.
- AIR strategy to significantly improve LLM performance in interactive data analysis by learning from history.
- Experiments show AIR improves GPT-4 by 44.5% in Tapilot-Crossing.

In summary, the paper introduces a new challenging benchmark Tapilot-Crossing for evaluating interactive data analysis agents, constructed using an innovative multi-agent environment. It also proposes an effective strategy AIR to enhance LLMs for this complex task by learning from previous successful interactions.
