## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interactive data analysis between humans and AI agents enables real-time data exploration for decision making. However, collecting realistic interactive logs is challenging and costly.  
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating interactive data analysis agents are limited in scope and practicality.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces Tapilot-Crossing, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on interactive data analysis across 4 modes: Normal, Action, Private, Private Action.
- Constructs the benchmark efficiently using a novel multi-agent environment called Decision Company.
- Evaluates popular LLMs on Tapilot-Crossing, highlighting capability gaps.  
- Proposes Adaptive Interaction Reflection (AIR) to guide LLMs to learn from successful history.

Main Contributions:
- Tapilot-Crossing benchmark with 1024 interactions covering practical scenarios. Constructed economically using Decision Company.
- Evaluation of LLMs on Tapilot-Crossing, underscoring challenges of interactive analysis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed AIR (Adaptive Interaction Reflection) strategy enable LLMs to learn from successful history? What are the key steps it takes to guide LLMs to reflect on past interactions?

2. The AIR strategy relies on the LLM itself to generate pseudo code logic based on previous interactions. What measures are taken to ensure the quality and accuracy of this self-generated pseudo code? 

3. When employing AIR, how does the method balance leveraging insights from previous successful interactions versus focusing on the current context and user input? Is there a risk it could overly rely on past interactions?

4. What were the key considerations in formulating the Accumulated Recall metric for evaluating code generation performance using private libraries? How does it capture the nuances beyond standard Accuracy?

5. How scalable is the AIR strategy to long conversation histories? Are there any truncation or filtering steps taken when selecting successful past interactions to reflect upon?

6. Could the AIR strategy be extended to learn from unsuccessful past interactions as well? If so, how could we guide models to extract meaningful logic from flawed interactions?

7. How robust is AIR when the history contains noisy or low-quality interactions? Are there any measures incorporated to select only high-quality interactions for reflection?  

8. What prompted the inclusion of both code generation and multiple choice tasks for evaluation? What different agent capabilities do these assess?

9. Why is GPT-4 better able to follow complex human instructions compared to other models? What architectural or training differences allow for this?

10. How exactly does the Executor tool provide real-time feedback to agents on intermediate results during the code generation process? And what benefits does this offer?
