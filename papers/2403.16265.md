# [Connecting the Dots: Inferring Patent Phrase Similarity with Retrieved   Phrase Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of inferring semantic similarity between phrases in patent documents. Patents employ highly technical legal language, so existing semantic similarity methods that rely on localized context do not work well. Additionally, obtaining expert annotations for patent phrase similarity is difficult and costly due to the expertise required, leading to a lack of labeled data.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method called Retrieval Augmented Patent Phrase Similarity (RA-Sim) to address these challenges. For a given patent phrase, RA-Sim constructs a "phrase graph" connecting the phrase to related patents and phrases. This provides additional global context beyond just the local context of the phrase. The phrase embedding is then an augmentation of a contextualized text embedding of the phrase and a graph neural network-based embedding of its phrase graph.

RA-Sim is trained using two self-supervised contrastive losses: 1) bringing the phrase node closer to patent nodes linked to it versus a negative phrase, and 2) bringing cited patent nodes closer versus negative patents. This learns to leverage the topological structure of the retrieved phrase graphs without needing semantic similarity labels.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel patent phrase graph construction and incorporation of global contextual information to enhance patent phrase embeddings. 
- Introduces a self-supervised learning framework to train on retrieved graphs to address label scarcity, consisting of pairwise contrastive losses based on graph topology.
- Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on patent phrase similarity, outperforming previous methods by a large margin in a self-supervised setup. Ablations validate the importance of different components.
- First work to show effectiveness of retrieval-based graph augmentation for improving contextualized embeddings in the patent domain.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in improving patent phrase similarity inference through a retrieve-and-learn graph augmentation approach trained with self-supervision.
