# [Connecting the Dots: Inferring Patent Phrase Similarity with Retrieved   Phrase Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of inferring semantic similarity between phrases in patent documents. Patents employ highly technical legal language, so existing semantic similarity methods that rely on localized context do not work well. Additionally, obtaining expert annotations for patent phrase similarity is difficult and costly due to the expertise required, leading to a lack of labeled data.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method called Retrieval Augmented Patent Phrase Similarity (RA-Sim) to address these challenges. For a given patent phrase, RA-Sim constructs a "phrase graph" connecting the phrase to related patents and phrases. This provides additional global context beyond just the local context of the phrase. The phrase embedding is then an augmentation of a contextualized text embedding of the phrase and a graph neural network-based embedding of its phrase graph.

RA-Sim is trained using two self-supervised contrastive losses: 1) bringing the phrase node closer to patent nodes linked to it versus a negative phrase, and 2) bringing cited patent nodes closer versus negative patents. This learns to leverage the topological structure of the retrieved phrase graphs without needing semantic similarity labels.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel patent phrase graph construction and incorporation of global contextual information to enhance patent phrase embeddings. 
- Introduces a self-supervised learning framework to train on retrieved graphs to address label scarcity, consisting of pairwise contrastive losses based on graph topology.
- Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on patent phrase similarity, outperforming previous methods by a large margin in a self-supervised setup. Ablations validate the importance of different components.
- First work to show effectiveness of retrieval-based graph augmentation for improving contextualized embeddings in the patent domain.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in improving patent phrase similarity inference through a retrieve-and-learn graph augmentation approach trained with self-supervision.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a patent phrase similarity inference method called RA-Sim that retrieves a phrase graph containing related patents and phrases to augment the contextualized embedding of a patent phrase for improved similarity measurement, trained using a self-supervised objective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method called Retrieval Augmented Patent Phrase Similarity (RA-Sim) to improve patent phrase similarity inference. Specifically:

1) RA-Sim introduces a graph-augmented approach that constructs a "phrase ego graph" for each patent phrase, linking it to focal patents where the phrase appears and related patents connected via citations. This amplifies the global contextual information beyond just the local context. 

2) RA-Sim employs a self-supervised learning objective to train the text encoder and graph encoder jointly. It defines two losses - a retrieval contrastive loss and a citation contrastive loss - that capitalize on the retrieved graph topology. This addresses the challenge of limited labeled data.

3) Experiments on a patent phrase similarity dataset demonstrate that RA-Sim outperforms existing semantic textual similarity methods by a substantial margin in the self-supervised setting. It also shows consistent improvements in the supervised setting. This highlights the benefits of the proposed retrieved graph augmentation approach.

In summary, the main novelty is using retrieval to construct informative "phrase ego graphs", combined with self-supervised graph learning, to significantly enhance patent phrase similarity inference.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Patent phrase similarity inference - The main task studied in the paper, which involves measuring the semantic similarity between phrases extracted from patent documents.

- Retrieval-based augmentation - A key technique proposed in the paper, which retrieves a graph of related patent and phrase nodes to augment the representation of a patent phrase with additional contextual information. 

- Phrase ego graph - The subgraph retrieved for a particular phrase node, comprising related patent and phrase nodes. Used to provide global context.

- Self-supervised learning - A training approach used where the model objectives are derived from the retrieved graph structure itself, without requiring manually labeled data.

- Patent language - The paper discusses challenges with patent language being legalistic and technical compared to general text.

- BM25 retrieval - Used to efficiently retrieve the most relevant patents for a given phrase query when constructing phrase ego graphs. 

- Graph neural networks - Specifically graph attention networks (GATs) which are used to encode the retrieved graph structure.

So in summary, key terms cover the patent phrase similarity task, the idea of retrieval-based augmentation with graphs, the self-supervised methodology, and how technical patent language poses challenges.
