# [Genetic Auto-prompt Learning for Pre-trained Code Intelligence Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13588)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become very large, making their usage prohibitively expensive due to high computational costs. 
- Prompt learning emerges as a potential solution to reduce computational costs, but relies heavily on meticulous manual design of prompts, requiring substantial human expertise.  
- Existing automatic prompt design methods have limitations such as gradient dependence, high computational demands, and limited applicability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose GenAP, a genetic algorithm based method to automatically design prompts in a gradient-free and cost-effective way. 
- Tailored crossover and mutation operators are designed specifically for prompt design. 
- A variable-length encoding strategy is used to bridge the gap between typical fixed-length encodings in GAs and unknown optimal prompt lengths.

Contributions:
- First empirical study investigating effectiveness of prompt learning for code intelligence tasks. Findings show performance relies heavily on prompt design.
- Assessment of existing automatic prompt design methods shows they have deficiencies when applied to code intelligence.  
- GenAP operates gradient-free, with no extra computational costs, supporting both understanding and generation tasks.
- GenAP outperforms manual and existing automatic prompt design methods, effectively automating prompt design process.
- Well-designed genetic algorithm components tailored specifically for prompt design problem.

In summary, the paper demonstrates GenAP as an effective automated prompt design solution for code intelligence that avoids limitations of existing methods. Experiments across models and tasks validate improved performance over prior prompt tuning approaches.
