# [ResQ: Residual Quantization for Video Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that leveraging the temporal redundancy between video frames through residual quantization can improve the accuracy vs efficiency trade-off of quantized video perception models. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Residuals (differences between activations of neighboring frames) have lower variance than raw activations, making them easier to quantize with lower error.- A quantization scheme can be designed to use high precision for keyframes, and lower precision for residuals, to reduce overall quantization error. - The quantization precision for residuals can be dynamically adjusted based on residual content, using more bits when residuals are large, fewer bits when residuals are small.The paper proposes Residual Quantization (ResQ) and Dynamic ResQ as implementations of these ideas, and validates through experiments on semantic segmentation, pose estimation and video object segmentation that they improve accuracy and/or efficiency over standard per-frame quantization.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging temporal redundancy through residual quantization can lead to better video perception models, in terms of the accuracy/efficiency trade-off. The paper presents empirical validation of this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel quantization scheme for video networks called Residual Quantization (ResQ). The key ideas are:- Observing that residuals (differences between activations of adjacent frames) have lower variance than frame activations, making them more quantizable. This allows quantizing residuals at lower bit-widths with lower error.- Proposing ResQ, which uses two sets of quantizers - a high precision one for keyframes, and a lower precision one for residuals. This amortizes expensive computation on keyframes over several residuals.- Extending ResQ to dynamically adjust the bit-width for residuals based on their content, assigning higher bits when residuals are large and lower bits for small residuals.- Evaluating ResQ on semantic segmentation, pose estimation and video object segmentation, where it achieves better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs compared to standard quantization schemes and other video processing methods.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel residual quantization technique to improve the accuracy vs efficiency tradeoff of quantized video models by exploiting temporal redundancy. The dynamic extension further boosts these benefits.
