# [ResQ: Residual Quantization for Video Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that leveraging the temporal redundancy between video frames through residual quantization can improve the accuracy vs efficiency trade-off of quantized video perception models. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Residuals (differences between activations of neighboring frames) have lower variance than raw activations, making them easier to quantize with lower error.- A quantization scheme can be designed to use high precision for keyframes, and lower precision for residuals, to reduce overall quantization error. - The quantization precision for residuals can be dynamically adjusted based on residual content, using more bits when residuals are large, fewer bits when residuals are small.The paper proposes Residual Quantization (ResQ) and Dynamic ResQ as implementations of these ideas, and validates through experiments on semantic segmentation, pose estimation and video object segmentation that they improve accuracy and/or efficiency over standard per-frame quantization.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging temporal redundancy through residual quantization can lead to better video perception models, in terms of the accuracy/efficiency trade-off. The paper presents empirical validation of this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel quantization scheme for video networks called Residual Quantization (ResQ). The key ideas are:- Observing that residuals (differences between activations of adjacent frames) have lower variance than frame activations, making them more quantizable. This allows quantizing residuals at lower bit-widths with lower error.- Proposing ResQ, which uses two sets of quantizers - a high precision one for keyframes, and a lower precision one for residuals. This amortizes expensive computation on keyframes over several residuals.- Extending ResQ to dynamically adjust the bit-width for residuals based on their content, assigning higher bits when residuals are large and lower bits for small residuals.- Evaluating ResQ on semantic segmentation, pose estimation and video object segmentation, where it achieves better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs compared to standard quantization schemes and other video processing methods.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel residual quantization technique to improve the accuracy vs efficiency tradeoff of quantized video models by exploiting temporal redundancy. The dynamic extension further boosts these benefits.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to related work in efficient video perception:- The key novelty is using residual quantization to exploit temporal redundancy, rather than techniques like feature warping or distillation which have been more common. Quantizing residuals at lower bitwidths than keyframes is a simple but clever idea.- Compared to other residual processing methods like delta networks or skip convolutions, this method seems more direct and practical since it relies just on quantization rather than changing the model architecture or operations.- For tasks like segmentation and pose estimation which require per-frame prediction, this method looks very competitive to state-of-the-art in accuracy vs efficiency tradeoff. The dynamic precision model is especially impressive.- The biggest limitation compared to some other video processing methods is that it doesn't actually reduce the compute cost of peak frames, only the amortized cost across sequences. Methods like feature warping can actually reduce FLOPs.- This method is complementary to many other optimizations like pruned models or distillation. Combining with those could lead to further gains.- Overall, residual quantization seems like a simple but high potential approach to exploit temporal redundancy. The results are quite promising across multiple tasks. The dynamic precision extension is also clever. This seems like a solid contribution to efficient video perception. Testing it on even more architectures and tasks could further demonstrate its benefits.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on the abstract provided, this paper proposes Residual Quantization (ResQ), a novel quantization scheme for video networks that leverages cross-frame redundancies to reduce quantization error. The key idea is to use high precision quantization for keyframes, and low precision quantization for residuals between frames. This allows capturing detail from keyframes while efficiently processing residuals. The main contribution seems to be exploiting temporal correlation in videos to enable more aggressive quantization of neural networks for efficient video perception tasks.In one sentence: The paper proposes Residual Quantization, a quantization scheme for video networks that uses high precision on keyframes and low precision on residuals between frames to improve efficiency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the latency and memory overhead of ResQ: The authors note that propagating representations to future frames in ResQ leads to increased memory usage and latency, which could be problematic for memory-bound applications. They suggest investigating methods to reduce this overhead.- Implementing location-specific quantized operations: The authors note that implementing the dynamic per-pixel quantization used in dynamic ResQ is challenging and requires specialized hardware or implementations like gather-scatter convolutions. They suggest researching methods to enable this in practice. - Reducing peak BOPs: The authors note that while ResQ reduces average BOPs across a sequence, it does not reduce peak (max) BOPs per frame. They suggest exploring ways to also reduce peak costs.- Extending to other tasks: The authors validate ResQ on semantic segmentation, pose estimation and video object segmentation. They suggest extending study of residual quantization to other video analysis tasks.- Tackling residual quantization policy learning: The authors use a simple heuristic policy for dynamic bit allocation. They suggest investigating learned policies, e.g. with reinforcement learning.- Evaluating on dedicated acceleration hardware: The authors use BOPs and simulations for efficiency estimation. They suggest evaluating residual quantization on real low-bit hardware.In summary, the main future directions are improving the practicality and extending the applicability of residual quantization, as well as learning sophisticated policies for dynamic quantization. Evaluating on real hardware is also suggested.
