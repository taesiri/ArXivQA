# [LocalStyleFool: Regional Video Style Transfer Attack Using Segment   Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Prior attacks either have restricted perturbations (low attack efficiency) or unrestricted perturbations (lack of naturalness and temporal consistency). 
- StyleFool attack transfers style of the whole video, causing unnatural color and texture locally.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LocalStyleFool attack to add style transfer perturbations only to selected regions in video to enhance naturalness.
- Use Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment video frames and track regions across frames. 
- Select key regions based on combination of Grad-CAM output and region area. Apply different style transfer to these regions using style images from target class video to maintain temporal consistency.
- Fine-tune perturbations using optimization techniques like NES and PGD.

Main Contributions:
- Improve intra-frame and inter-frame naturalness of style transfer attack by transferring style of select regions instead of whole frame.
- Achieve high attack success rate and efficiency comparable to prior attacks.
- Demonstrate scalability to high resolution videos using SAM's accurate segmentation.
- Expose negative impact of techniques like SAM if used for malicious attacks.

In summary, the paper proposes an improved region-based style transfer attack that balances attack performance and imperceptibility through careful region selection and style transfer. The attack highlights issues of using emerging techniques like SAM for adversarial purposes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes LocalStyleFool, a video adversarial attack that adds regional style-transfer-based perturbations to videos using segmentation masks from SAM to improve naturalness while maintaining attack efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing LocalStyleFool, a new black-box attack for video recognition models that adds style transfer perturbations to different semantic regions in videos using different style images. This improves on StyleFool by enhancing the naturalness of stylized videos. 

2. LocalStyleFool requires competitive query budgets compared to prior attacks, but improves regional naturalness within frames and temporal consistency across frames. This is verified through comprehensive experiments and a human-assessed survey.

3. LocalStyleFool also shows excellent attack performance on high-resolution videos from the Kinetics-700 dataset. The authors claim they are the first to use the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to conduct adversarial attacks, hoping to raise attention to the potential negative impacts of such techniques.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an improved style transfer attack that adds perturbations to regions rather than entire frames, enhancing naturalness while maintaining attack efficiency. The attack also works on high-resolution video data thanks to the use of SAM.
