# [Mukhyansh: A Headline Generation Dataset for Indic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17743)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Mukhyansh, a new large-scale multilingual dataset for headline generation spanning 8 Indian languages - Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi and Gujarati. Comprising over 3.39 million article-headline pairs scraped from 47 diverse Indian news websites, Mukhyansh aims to advance headline generation research for low-resource Indian languages. The authors employ rigorous data filtering techniques like deduplication and length thresholds to ensure high quality. Through human evaluations and inter-annotator agreement analysis, they demonstrate Mukhyansh's reliability. Additionally, they establish strong baselines by evaluating various models including RNN encoder-decoders and pretrained transformers like mT5 and IndicBART on their dataset. Their comparative analysis reveals serious quality issues with existing headline generation dataset IndicHG, indicating Mukhyansh's superiority. After reproducible experiments and metrics analysis, they show IndicHG contains high data contamination that causes models to achieve artificially inflated performance. Finally, extensive test set evaluations reveal SSIB fine-tuned on Mukhyansh outperforms IndicHG models across languages, achieving average ROUGE-L score of 31.43 and confirming Mukhyansh's effectiveness for multilingual headline generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Mukhyansh, a large multilingual dataset of over 3.39 million news article-headline pairs for headline generation across 8 Indian languages, demonstrates the effectiveness of baseline models, and provides evidence to support the necessity of high-quality data through comparative analysis with existing datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presentation of Mukhyansh, a large multilingual headline generation dataset comprising over 3.39 million news article-headline pairs across 8 Indian languages - Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati.

2. Empirical analysis and evaluation of existing headline generation datasets for Indian languages, uncovering critical data quality issues in existing datasets like IndicNLG. 

3. Demonstration of the superiority of the Mukhyansh dataset and SSIB baseline model through extensive experimentation, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works in Indian language headline generation. The SSIB model fine-tuned on Mukhyansh achieves an average ROUGE-L score of 31.43 across the 8 languages.

4. Highlighting the importance of high-quality annotated data and models for advancing natural language generation research in low-resource Indian languages.

In summary, the main contribution is the creation and release of the large, high-quality, multilingual Mukhyansh dataset to enable further research into headline generation for Indian languages. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of this dataset through empirical analysis and state-of-the-art baseline results.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Mukhyansh - The name of the multilingual headline generation dataset introduced in the paper, spanning 8 Indian languages and over 3.39 million article-headline pairs.

- Low-resource languages - The paper focuses specifically on headline generation for Indian languages, which are considered low-resource compared to more widely used languages like English.

- Headline generation - The core task that the dataset and models in the paper are designed for.

- Multilinguality - The dataset and some of the models cover multiple Indian languages, not just one.

- Data quality/contamination - A major focus of the analysis is assessing and improving the quality of existing datasets for Indian language headline generation.

- IndicHG dataset - An existing multilingual headline generation dataset that is analyzed and compared to the newly introduced Mukhyansh.

- Baseline models - Various sequence-to-sequence, RNN, and transformer encoder-decoder models are tested as baselines on the new dataset.

- BPE, FastText, mT5, IndicBART - Specific techniques/architectures used in some of the baseline models.

So in summary, the key focus is on introducing a large, high-quality dataset (Mukhyansh) to advance headline generation research for Indian languages and benchmarking performance using baseline models. Data quality and multilinguality are also crucial topics explored in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions developing site-specific web scrapers for collecting the data. Can you elaborate on the challenges involved in designing these scrapers and how you tailored them for each website's unique structure?

2. You have used stratified sampling for creating the train/dev/test splits. What are the different strata you used and what was the rationale behind choosing those specific strata for sampling? 

3. One of the major contributions mentioned is the comparative analysis with existing datasets like IndicNLG. Can you walk through the quantitative and qualitative analysis done in more detail? What were some of the major issues uncovered in IndicNLG?

4. The human evaluation conducted seems fairly limited in scope (only for Telugu, 500 samples). Do you have plans to conduct more exhaustive human evaluations? What other parameters could be evaluated as part of human judgement?

5. For the baselines, 3 categories of models are reported. What was the motivation behind choosing these specific model architectures in each category? How do they complement each other?

6. You have used length normalization during beam search for some languages but not for others. What was the criteria used to decide this and how did you arrive at the optimal penalty value?

7. The baseline results indicate GRU + FastText provides good performance relative to model size. What architectural enhancements do you plan to the RNN models to further boost results without significantly increasing parameters?  

8. What multilingual models are you considering for fine-tuning on Mukhyansh due to resource constraints currently? What performance gains do you hypothesize over SSIB?

9. To enable multitask learning, are there any other NLG tasks you plan to explore jointly with headline generation using Mukhyansh? How can the dataset be extended to support such scenarios?

10. For real-world deployment, what are some of challenges expected in headline generation and how can your curated high-quality dataset help mitigate those?
