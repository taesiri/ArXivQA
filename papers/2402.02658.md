# [Multi-step Problem Solving Through a Verifier: An Empirical Analysis on   Model-induced Process Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models like GPT often make mistakes when solving complex, multi-step problems like math or coding challenges. Simply fine-tuning the models does not eliminate these errors.
- Using a separate "verifier" model to evaluate solutions helps, but training high-quality verifiers requires expensive human annotations of intermediate solution steps.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), which automatically generates training data to build verifier models. 
- For each intermediate step in a solution, MiPS completes it multiple times using the original "reasoner" model. The percentage of correct completions estimates the accuracy of that step.
- These step-wise accuracy estimates become training labels for a verifier model. The verifier scores intermediate steps so it provides process-level supervision.

Contributions:
- MiPS significantly boosts accuracy on math and coding tasks for GPT models (by 0.7-4% on 3 datasets) compared to output-only verifiers.
- Analysis shows MiPS verifiers favor different aggregation methods than human-labeled verifiers due to noise. Focusing on high scores works better.  
- Verifiers transfer across reasoners, indicating they avoid overfitting to a reasoner's specific mistakes.
- The approach is fully automated and generic to tasks with inspectable intermediate steps.

In summary, the paper presents MiPS as a way to automatically create training data for process-based verifier models. This supervision at intermediate steps improves multi-step problem solving for large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), a novel method to automatically generate training data to build process-supervised verifiers for evaluating and selecting high-quality solutions generated by reasoning models for complex problem solving tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), a novel method for automatically generating process supervision data to train process supervision verifiers. MiPS works by using a reasoner model to complete intermediate solutions multiple times, and estimating the accuracy of the intermediate step based on the percentage of correct completions.

2. It provides an empirical analysis on the design choices and properties when using a verifier trained on the noisy MiPS data, including:
- Showing that aggregation functions that focus on high predicted scores work better than ones focusing on low scores, contrary to prior work that used human-annotated data
- Demonstrating that later intermediate step predictions from the verifier are useful, but earlier steps can hurt performance
- Showing the verifier generalizes across different reasoner models 

3. It extends the evaluation of problem solving with verifiers from math tasks to coding tasks.

4. It compares MiPS to concurrent work and shows complementary benefits.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an automatic way to generate process supervision data to train process supervision verifiers, along with an analysis on using such verifiers trained on noisy automatic data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS) can significantly improve the performance of LLMs on math and coding tasks. Can you elaborate more on what specific improvements were observed and how significant they were compared to other methods like output verification or self-consistency?

2. MiPS involves sampling completions of intermediate solutions using the reasoning model itself. Could the noises introduced by the imperfect reasoning model negatively impact the quality of the process supervision data? How does the paper analyze and address this? 

3. The paper suggests that verification should focus more on high predicted values from the verifier compared to low values when using MiPS data. What is the intuition behind this and how does it differ from prior work using human-annotated data?

4. When aggregating the step-wise prediction scores from the process verifier, why do functions like min and sum of log probabilities perform poorly for MiPS data? How do the good aggregation functions identified differ?

5. How does incorporating predictions from earlier intermediate steps impact performance when using the MiPS process verifier? Does this indicate potential issues in the quality of data for initial steps?

6. The analysis shows that using only the last-step process verification score can sometimes outperform full output verification. What explanations are provided for why MiPS data helps improve generalization capability? 

7. What experiments are conducted in the paper to evaluate whether the MiPS process verifier overfits to the specific imperfections of the reasoning model used to generate training data? What do the results show?

8. How does the MiPS approach for process supervision data curation compare with the concurrent work Math-Shepherd? What are some key differences identified?

9. What scope constraints need to be satisfied for the MiPS approach to be applicable for a problem-solving domain? When would generating process supervision data automatically be difficult?

10. The paper focuses analysis on model-induced process supervision for math and coding problems. What other complex, multi-step problem solving domains could this approach be beneficial for? What adaptations may be required?
