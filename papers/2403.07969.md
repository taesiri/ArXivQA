# [KnowCoder: Coding Structured Knowledge into LLMs for Universal   Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Universal Information Extraction (UIE) aims to extract structured knowledge from text following different schemas using one model. However, existing UIE models have difficulties in 1) representing schemas in an easy-to-understand and unified way for large language models (LLMs), and 2) effectively training LLMs to accurately follow schemas to extract knowledge.

Proposed Solution - KnowCoder:
- Represents schemas as Python classes - captures concept taxonomies, constraints, definitions and extraction guidelines. Also constructed a library with 30K+ schema types.
- Two-phase learning framework - Schema Understanding Phase: trains LLM to understand concepts via pretraining on schema definition and instance code. Schema Following Phase: trains LLM to accurately follow schemas and extract information using instruction code.

Contributions:  
- Code-style schema representation to unify and model complex schemas for UIE.  
- Schema library covering over 30K types of entities, relations and events.
- A two-phase training framework to enhance LLMs' schema understanding and following abilities.
- Code pretraining significantly improves few-shot performance (49.8% relative gain over baseline). 
- Zero-shot experiments show strong generalization ability (12.5% relative gain).
- Low resource experiments exhibit superior adaptability (21.9% relative gain).
- Refinement using human-labeled data leads to further gains across IE tasks.

In summary, KnowCoder leverages code-style schema representation and two-phase training on large auto-generated data to impart LLMs with schema understanding and following abilities for universal information extraction. Experiments demonstrate strong generalization, low-resource adaptability and refinements from human supervision across multiple IE tasks.
