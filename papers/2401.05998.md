# [Combating Adversarial Attacks with Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05998)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the use of multi-agent debate between language models at inference time to improve robustness against adversarial attacks, finding some benefits but also limitations in debate's ability to fully mitigate harmful responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of using multi-agent debate between language models at inference time to improve their robustness to adversarial attacks. Specifically, the authors:

1) Implement a multi-agent debate framework where different LM "agents" with varying safety alignments debate responses to adversarial prompts. They compare this to baselines like self-refinement.

2) Evaluate the toxicity of model responses to known adversarial prompts, using both the Perspective API as well as their own fine-tuned classifier. 

3) Find that multi-agent debate can reduce toxicity compared to baselines when a harmful agent debates with a harmless agent, but debates between multiple harmful agents can increase toxicity.

4) Analyze model robustness to different types of attacks by clustering adversarial prompts and evaluating toxicity of responses.

The key conclusion is that while multi-agent debate shows some promise for improving robustness to adversarial attacks, there are still many open questions around debate dynamics and efficiency that need to be addressed before this can be an effective and scalable defense. The analysis also highlights model-specific differences in susceptibility to certain kinds of adversarial attacks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts covered include:

- Multi-agent debate - Using multiple language model agents to discuss and critique each other's responses to improve robustness.

- Adversarial attacks - Crafting inputs meant to cause models to generate unsafe, biased, or misleading outputs. Examples mentioned include adversarial prompts and data poisoning.  

- Red teaming - Attempting to uncover weaknesses or problematic behaviors in language models by acting as an adversary.

- Toxicity - Generating offensive, insensitive, or harmful content.

- Model alignment - Training or fine-tuning models to improve safety, ethics, and appropriateness of outputs.

- Harmlessness - Avoiding generating content that could be perceived as dangerous, illegal, or unethical.

- Inference-time robustness - Improving model resilience against attacks specifically during model deployment after training.

The key goals analyzed are using multi-agent debate to mitigate adversarial attacks and toxicity at inference time compared to baselines, assessing debate dynamics between models with different safety alignment levels, and analyzing model susceptibility to different types of adversarial prompt content.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using multi-agent debate to improve model robustness against adversarial attacks. How exactly does the debate framework allow multiple models to interact and provide feedback to each other? What mechanisms enable the models to update their responses based on other agents' outputs?

2. The authors evaluate both single-agent and multi-agent settings. What specifically did they change between these two settings to isolate the effects of multi-agent debate? How does this help demonstrate the benefits of debate over just self-refinement by a single model?

3. The paper explores agents with different "intentions" guided by the prompt formatting. Can you explain how the prompts for harmless, neutral, and harmful agents differ? What kinds of prompt engineering did the authors use to manipulate model intentions? 

4. When analyzing model toxicity, the paper uses both the Perspective API scores and a separately trained classifier. What data and method were used to train this additional classifier? How does its performance compare to the Perspective API?

5. The clustering analysis categorizes different types of adversarial attacks and model susceptibility. What methodology did the authors use to group the adversarial prompts? How did toxicity scores differ across categories between models like LLama vs GPT?

6. The paper finds differences in how debate dynamics affect toxicity between Llama vs GPT models. What accounts for this discrepancy in observed effects? How might the models' training objectives or architecture lead to these differences?

7. When models debate, the paper observes toxicity increases if one model outputs harmful text. Why does this occur, and why is the effect less pronounced in the opposite direction? How could the framework be refined to further mitigate potential harms?

8. What are some weaknesses of using multi-agent debate as an inference-time technique? How might factors like model cost, latency, and capability affect the viability of this approach under realistic conditions?

9. The paper focuses on toxicity, but are there other model behaviors or attributes multi-agent debate could improve? What kinds of prompts could explore benefits beyond toxicity? How else could the debate dynamics be expanded?

10. How was model testing implemented to ensure privacy and prevent exploits? What subgroup analysis was done to confirm models did not develop new vulnerabilities from debate? What ethical precautions were taken during design and evaluation?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks at inference time, such as adversarially-generated prompts that aim to elicit harmful, toxic, or dangerous model responses. Improving language models' robustness is key for safe real-world deployment.

Proposed Solution:  
- Implement multi-agent debate between language models to evaluate if debate can help mitigate adversarial attacks. Models self-evaluate and provide feedback through discussion.
- Test debate between models from GPT and LLAMA families, using prompt engineering to simulate effects of poisoned models. 
- Probe models' toxicity to known dangerous prompts in single-agent, self-refine, and multi-agent settings.

Key Findings:
- Multi-agent debate reduces toxicity for models equipped with debate, even if a model starts with or develops harmful intent, especially if forced to debate with a non-poisoned model.  
- Models aligned for safety and responsibility still remain sensitive to specifically designed prompts. Simple prompt fixes to start responses in a certain way significantly increase toxicity.
- Multi-agent debate outperforms self-refinement baselines when initial models are poisoned.
- Toxicity level differs based on attack types. Models have varying sensitivity to insults, unlawful activities, privacy violations etc.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing multi-agent debate can mitigate existing adversarial attacks, but risks remain if all debating models are compromised.
- Evidence that language models amplify the intent (harmlessness or harm) they are conditioned on via prompting.
- Novel framework and methodology for evaluating debate dynamics between language models prompted adversarially.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that multi-agent debate shows promise for safeguarding models against adversarial attacks if implemented carefully, while also highlighting risks inherent to debate techniques. It provides analysis to inform future work on adversarial robustness and safe deployment.
