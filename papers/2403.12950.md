# [Optimal and Adaptive Non-Stationary Dueling Bandits Under a Generalized   Borda Criterion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Studies the challenging non-stationary dueling bandits problem where the preference matrices between arms can change arbitrarily over time. Prior works have mostly studied this under strong assumptions and focused on the Condorcet winner setting.

- This paper investigates the more general Borda winner setting as well as studies tighter notions of non-stationarity outside common assumptions like SSTI for the Condorcet case. 

- The notion of "significant shifts" from prior non-stationary bandit works is extended to define significant Borda winner switches and significant Condorcet winner switches. The goal is to design algorithms with regret bounds in terms of these tighter notions of non-stationarity.

Contributions:

- Introduces a new notion of generalized Borda scores to unify analysis of both Borda and Condorcet objectives. This framework allows reduction of Condorcet regret to a Borda-like quantity.

- Achieves first optimal and adaptive dynamic regret for Borda objective (K^{1/3}T^{2/3}L^{1/3}) in terms of number of significant Borda winner switches. Prior work only had suboptimal and non-adaptive rates.

- For Condorcet, shows under a General Identifiability Condition (weaker than common assumptions like SSTI), a new non-stationarity measure based on approximate Condorcet winner changes can be adaptively learned. Attains regret rate of K^{2/3}T^{2/3}S^{1/3} in terms approximate changes S.

- The techniques also yield improved Condorcet rates over prior works in regimes with heavier non-stationarity. For example, when number of winner switches differs appreciably from tighter non-stationarity notions captured by the approximate changes.

Main Novelty:
- Unified view of Borda and Condorcet via generalized Borda scores allows reduction of Condorcet regret to Borda-like quantity. Enables analysis avoiding assumptions like SSTI.
