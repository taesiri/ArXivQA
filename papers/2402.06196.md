# [Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of large language models (LLMs), a new class of powerful neural network models that have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. 

The paper begins by providing background on the evolution of language models, from early statistical models to recent breakthroughs with transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT. It then introduces LLMs as an emerging model family that contains billions or even trillions of parameters, far surpassing previous models. 

Three main LLM families are reviewed in detail - the GPT models from OpenAI, the LLaMA models from Meta, and the PaLM models from Google. Other prominent LLMs like FLAN, Gopher and LaMDA are also discussed. The architectures, model scales, training techniques and benchmark performances are covered for each model.

The paper then dives into the techniques involved in building, using and augmenting LLMs. This includes data collection and cleaning, tokenization, pre-training objectives like masked language modeling, instruction tuning to align models to specific tasks, and decoding strategies like nucleus sampling. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is highlighted as a technique to provide LLMs external knowledge. Prompt engineering methods like chain-of-thought prompting are also analyzed.

An overview of popular LLM datasets and benchmarks is provided, covering areas like language understanding, reasoning, arithmetic, programming, dialog and more. Available results show that the largest proprietary models from OpenAI and Google lead on most benchmarks, but open source alternatives like LLaMA are rapidly improving.

Finally, the paper summarizes the main challenges and future directions, like developing smaller yet performant models, new architectural innovations beyond attention, multi-modal capabilities, better techniques to mitigate limitations like hallucinations, and responsible model development.

In summary, this paper offers a holistic overview of the rapidly advancing field of LLMs, covering the state-of-the-art along multiple dimensions like prominent models, usage techniques, evaluation methods and open challenges. It serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers and practitioners in AI to better understand these powerful models.
