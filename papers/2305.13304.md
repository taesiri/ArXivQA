# [RecurrentGPT: Interactive Generation of (Arbitrarily) Long Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central research question is: 

How can we enable large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate arbitrarily long coherent texts beyond the fixed-size context limitations of the Transformer architecture?

The key idea proposed in the paper is to design a system called RecurrentGPT that simulates recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using natural language prompts and components. This allows leveraging the unlimited context capabilities of RNNs while still using LLMs like ChatGPT as the backbone model.

Specifically, RecurrentGPT:

- Replaces vectorized components in RNNs (e.g. cell/hidden states, input/output) with natural language paragraphs and summaries 

- Uses prompt engineering to simulate RNN computational graphs and recurrence 

- Stores long-term memory on disk and accesses it via semantic search

- Maintains a short-term memory paragraph updated via the LLM

- Allows human interaction by editing language memories and plans

The central hypothesis is that by designing prompts to simulate RNN architectures, RecurrentGPT will enable LLMs to generate much longer coherent text than normally possible with the fixed-size Transformer context. The experiments aim to evaluate this hypothesis across different text generation tasks and genres.

In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates a novel prompting approach to get around context limitations of LLMs for long text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a model called RecurrentGPT, which uses natural language to simulate the recurrence mechanism in RNNs and enables large language models like ChatGPT to generate arbitrarily long text beyond their fixed context size limitation. 

2. Demonstrating that RecurrentGPT can generate very long and coherent texts either autonomously or interactively with a human writer. It can serve as an interpretable and customizable AI writing assistant.

3. Introducing a new use case of using RecurrentGPT as a personalized interactive fiction/game that directly interacts with readers, instead of just being used as a tool for writers. The authors call this "AI as Content".

4. Showing the potential of borrowing ideas from cognitive science and deep learning model designs like RNNs to create better prompts for large language models. 

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing RecurrentGPT as a way to get around the context size limitation of models like ChatGPT and enable new applications like interactive fiction through prompting. The novelty lies in using natural language to simulate RNN recurrence and achieve human-AI interaction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary: 

The paper introduces RecurrentGPT, a method that uses natural language prompts to simulate recurrent neural networks with large language models like ChatGPT, enabling them to generate arbitrarily long coherent texts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper introduces RecurrentGPT, a novel method for enabling large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate arbitrarily long coherent text. This addresses a key limitation of LLMs, which can only generate text within a fixed context window. 

- Most prior work on generating long text with LLMs has taken a hierarchical approach - first generating an outline or summary, then generating the full text conditioned on that high-level plan. Examples are RE^3, DOC, and various story generation methods. RecurrentGPT is fundamentally different in that it simulates RNN recurrence to allow iterative, interactive generation of unbounded lengths.

- Some recent work has tried to modify the Transformer architecture itself to add recurrence, like Transformer-XL, Compressive Transformers, etc. However, this requires changing the model architecture, while RecurrentGPT works purely through prompting any unmodified LLM. This is a big advantage since it can leverage state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT as-is.

- For controllable long text generation, RecurrentGPT contrasts with most existing AI writing assistants focused on local phrase/sentence suggestions. It reduces human effort through paragraph-level generation and interactivity. The interpretability via natural language for memories and plans is also novel.

- Demonstrating the use of RecurrentGPT for interactive fiction represents an innovative application of LLMs - using them not just as creative tools but directly as personalized interactive content. The "AI as Content" paradigm is largely unexplored.

- Stepping back, RecurrentGPT shows the promise of using concepts from RNNs, cognitive science, etc. to design prompts that expand capabilities of LLMs. Much prompt engineering research focuses narrowly on task performance; this looks at broader architectural principles.

In summary, RecurrentGPT introduces a novel prompting approach to equip LLMs with recurrence for long text generation. The applications for controllable, interactive story generation and playable fiction highlight unique capabilities. The work ties together several important themes around prompting, interpretability, and imaginative uses of LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Evaluating RecurrentGPT on even longer text generation tasks beyond the ~5000 word texts tested in the paper. The authors note that evaluating much longer generated texts is challenging, but suggest it as an important direction for future work.

- Using more powerful LLMs as the backbone model for RecurrentGPT. The results showed significant gains when using GPT-4 instead of ChatGPT, indicating there is room for improvement with larger LLMs.

- Fine-tuning the LLM backbone of RecurrentGPT with supervised finetuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback when using it for interactive fiction. This could help improve consistency and relevance of generated content.

- Exploring additional prompts and modifications to RecurrentGPT to simulate other types of recurrent neural networks or deep learning models beyond LSTMs. The authors suggest prompt engineering with LLMs to borrow ideas from other models is a promising direction.

- Conducting more extensive user studies to thoroughly evaluate RecurrentGPT as an AI writing assistant and for interactive fiction applications. The authors note their user studies so far have been small-scale.

- Continuing to explore the paradigm of "AI as Content" where generative models directly interact with consumers. RecurrentGPT demonstrated potential for personalized interactive fiction in this domain.

In summary, the key suggestions are scaling up in terms of length of generated text, using larger LLM backbones, exploring ways to improve interactive applications like fiction and writing assistants, and further developing the idea of AI directly interacting with users as content.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces RecurrentGPT, a framework that enables large language models like ChatGPT to generate arbitrarily long text beyond their fixed-size context limitation. RecurrentGPT simulates the recurrence mechanism of RNNs using natural language components. It models the input, output, long-term memory, and short-term memory of an RNN with paragraphs of text and outlines. It then uses prompt engineering to define the recurrent computation graph that operates on these components. At each timestep, RecurrentGPT takes the previously generated content and plan as input, retrieves relevant long-term memory, and generates new content, a plan, and an updated short-term memory. The natural language building blocks make RecurrentGPT interpretable and allow human interaction. Experiments show it can generate very long coherent texts either autonomously or as an interactive assistant. It also demonstrates using generative models to directly interact with consumers as personalized interactive fiction. Overall, RecurrentGPT shows the potential of borrowing ideas from cognitive science and deep learning to prompt large language models for long text generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called RecurrentGPT which enables large language models like ChatGPT to generate arbitrarily long text. RecurrentGPT simulates the recurrence mechanism of RNNs using natural language building blocks. It represents the components of an RNN such as input, output, cell state, and hidden state with paragraphs of text. At each timestep, it receives a paragraph of text and a brief plan generated in the previous step. It attends to a long-term memory stored on disk which contains summaries of previously generated paragraphs. It also maintains a short-term memory paragraph that summarizes recent information. RecurrentGPT then generates a new paragraph, plan, and updates the short and long-term memories. This allows it to generate text of any length while maintaining coherence.

Experiments show RecurrentGPT can generate thousands of tokens of coherent and engaging text, unlike vanilla ChatGPT which fails after a few hundred tokens. It can generate text on its own or serve as an interactive assistant to help human writers. RecurrentGPT is more efficient, interpretable, customizable, and interactive compared to existing writing assistants. It represents a step towards next-generation writing systems beyond local suggestions. The authors also show it can be used as personalized interactive fiction by generating multiple plans for readers to choose from. Broadly, the work shows how recurrent neural network designs can be simulated with language for prompting large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces RecurrentGPT, a framework that enables large language models like ChatGPT to generate arbitrarily long and coherent text beyond their fixed context size limitation. It does this by using natural language to simulate the recurrence mechanism of RNNs. Specifically, it models the components of an LSTM (input, output, long-term memory, short-term memory) with paragraphs of text, and defines the recurrent computation graph with prompt engineering instead of using a fixed neural network architecture. At each timestep, it prompts the LLM to generate a new paragraph of text along with updates to short-term memory and appends a summary of the output to long-term memory stored separately. The short-term memory paragraph fits in the context size while long-term memory can be much longer using storage and retrieval with sentence embeddings. This language-based recurrence mechanism allows it to generate very long texts without forgetting previous context like vanilla LLMs. Human interaction is also enabled by the interpretability and editability of the language-based components.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main problem the paper is trying to address is the limitation of large language models (LLMs) like GPT in generating arbitrarily long coherent texts due to their fixed-sized context window. 

The key question appears to be - how can we enable LLMs to generate very long, coherent texts beyond their fixed context size limitation?

The paper proposes a method called RecurrentGPT to address this problem. The key ideas seem to be:

1) Simulating the recurrence mechanism of RNNs using natural language components and prompt engineering with LLMs. This allows mimicking an RNN-like capability of maintaining long-term context/memory.

2) Defining language-based building blocks like paragraph-level content, plans, long-term and short-term memory using natural language. This provides interpretability and enables human interaction.

3) Leveraging the LLM's capabilities along with the simulated recurrence and language building blocks to generate very long texts.

Additionally, the paper explores using RecurrentGPT for interactive fiction generation, which allows direct interaction with consumers instead of just content creators.

In summary, the key focus is on enabling LLMs to go beyond their fixed context size limitation in generating arbitrarily long coherent text by simulating RNN recurrence with natural language. A secondary contribution is interactive fiction generation.
