# [TNF: Tri-branch Neural Fusion for Multimodal Medical Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal medical data classification (e.g. combining images and tabular data) is important for diagnosis but faces challenges like label inconsistency across modalities and requirement of all modalities at inference time.  
- Existing methods use either ensemble (trains separate models) or fusion (merges features). Ensemble lacks accuracy while fusion struggles with aforementioned challenges.

Proposed Solution - Tri-branch Neural Fusion (TNF):
- Uses both ensemble and fusion by having 3 branches - image, tabular and fused.
- Image and tabular branches are trained on respective modalities. 
- Fusion branch merges features from image and tabular branches.
- Final prediction ensemble outputs of the 3 branches.

Addressing Label Inconsistency:
- Proposes two solutions - label masking (masks loss from fusion branch if labels differ) and maximum likelihood selection (selects image slices with highest prediction confidence).

Main Contributions:  
- TNF framework that enhances accuracy over ensemble/fusion and allows inference with missing modalities.
- Solutions to tackle label inconsistency problem.  
- Shows TNF generalizability across datasets, modalities and CNN/Transformer architectures.
- Visualizations proving fused branch focuses on discriminative regions.
- Individual image, tabular branches also achieve better accuracy after TNF fine-tuning.

In summary, the paper presents TNF that advances multimodal medical classification by combining strengths of ensemble and fusion while resolving key challenges. Extensive validations illustrate wide applicability.
