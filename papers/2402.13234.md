# [Unlocking Insights: Semantic Search in Jupyter Notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic search plays a pivotal role in information retrieval by understanding intent and contextual meaning instead of just keyword matches. 
- Applying semantic search to Jupyter Notebooks can enhance the ability to retrieve relevant outputs, functions, methods and information.
- Challenges include identifying the right notebook content to generate embeddings and overcoming token size limits of embedding models.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a semantic search framework tailored for Jupyter Notebooks with data preprocessing, embedding generation, data storage and search components.
- Preprocess markdown and code cells differently. Handle long code cells by extracting only class/function code using AST.
- Summarize long code functions with GPT-4 to overcome token limits. Generate embeddings from preprocessed cells and summaries.  
- Store embeddings in Weaviate database. Update db every 15 mins to stay consistent with source notebooks.
- Support exact, user-defined and code summary based search queries.

Main Contributions:
- Innovative way to handle token size limits by switching from cell-level to function-level embedding generation. Use of GPT-4 for summarization.
- Evaluation showing GPT-based code summaries can retrieve original code better than human queries.
- Framework and pipeline to apply semantic search specifically to Jupyter Notebooks using state-of-the-art LLMs.
- Identified future work like enriching inputs to LLMs, evaluating cell-level summarization, adding output/graph embeddings etc.

In summary, the paper presents a novel semantic search framework for Jupyter Notebooks that leverages innovations like function-level embedding generation and GPT-4 based code summarization to overcome key challenges.
