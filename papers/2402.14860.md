# [Ranking Large Language Models without Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14860)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and ranking large language models (LLMs) is important but challenging. Using human evaluations is expensive. Metrics based on reference responses can be unreliable. 

- Existing methods either require expensive human judgments or assume access to a reliable reference model, which may not exist. 

- There is a need for low-resource methods to evaluate and rank LLMs, especially for open-ended generative tasks like summarization and dialog where obtaining reference responses is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea is to consider triplets of models where each model judges the other two. Intuition is an expert can identify a novice when paired with a knowledgeable model. 

- Don't assume any model is an expert. Use agreement between models in a triplet to identify the worst model. Apply this iteratively to rank all models.

- Present two algorithms: Greedy Triplet Ranking (GTR) which is more efficient, and Full Triplet Ranking (FTR) which considers all possible triplets.

- Provide analysis on conditions for the approach to succeed based on model accuracies.

Contributions:
- Novel perspective to rank generative models without ground truth data.

- Two algorithms built on triplet agreement idea along with complexity analysis.

- Empirical evaluation on summarization, dialog and multiple choice showing close to true rankings can be recovered.

- Analysis providing intuition on when the approach works.

Overall the paper provides a novel idea and algorithms to rank LLMs which can enable large scale evaluations without ground truth data. The empirical results across tasks demonstrate the viability of the ideas proposed.
