# [Ranking Large Language Models without Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14860)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and ranking large language models (LLMs) is important but challenging. Using human evaluations is expensive. Metrics based on reference responses can be unreliable. 

- Existing methods either require expensive human judgments or assume access to a reliable reference model, which may not exist. 

- There is a need for low-resource methods to evaluate and rank LLMs, especially for open-ended generative tasks like summarization and dialog where obtaining reference responses is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea is to consider triplets of models where each model judges the other two. Intuition is an expert can identify a novice when paired with a knowledgeable model. 

- Don't assume any model is an expert. Use agreement between models in a triplet to identify the worst model. Apply this iteratively to rank all models.

- Present two algorithms: Greedy Triplet Ranking (GTR) which is more efficient, and Full Triplet Ranking (FTR) which considers all possible triplets.

- Provide analysis on conditions for the approach to succeed based on model accuracies.

Contributions:
- Novel perspective to rank generative models without ground truth data.

- Two algorithms built on triplet agreement idea along with complexity analysis.

- Empirical evaluation on summarization, dialog and multiple choice showing close to true rankings can be recovered.

- Analysis providing intuition on when the approach works.

Overall the paper provides a novel idea and algorithms to rank LLMs which can enable large scale evaluations without ground truth data. The empirical results across tasks demonstrate the viability of the ideas proposed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes methods to rank large language models on generative tasks without access to ground truth data by using triplets of models to evaluate each other and identify the worst model, then repeating this process to produce model rankings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing methods to rank large language models (LLMs) without requiring access to ground truth data or human judgements. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Consider triplets of LLMs, where each model judges the other two. This allows identifying the worst model in a triplet with high probability.

2) Repeatedly applying this triplet idea, two algorithms are proposed - Greedy Triplet Ranking (GTR) and Full Triplet Ranking (FTR) to rank an arbitrary number of LLMs.

3) Theoretical analysis is provided on sufficient conditions for the triplet approach to succeed.

4) Experiments on summarization, multiple choice, and dialog tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods can reliably recover LLM rankings close to the true rankings based on reference data, without actually having access to any reference data.

In summary, the main contribution is a practical low-resource mechanism to rank LLMs which could help enable larger scale evaluations and benchmarks.

The paper proposes two methods - Greedy Triplet Ranking and Full Triplet Ranking - to rank large language models on generative tasks without requiring ground truth data. The key idea is to use triplets of models to evaluate each other, identify the worst model, and repeat this to eventually rank all the models. The methods are analyzed theoretically and evaluated on summarization, multiple choice QA, and dialog tasks. Key terms reflect this core contribution as well as the experimental setup and evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel triplet approach to rank language models without access to any ground truth or reference responses. Can you elaborate on the intuition behind this approach and why considering triplets of models helps overcome the lack of ground truth data?

2. The paper analyzes the proposed triplet approach and provides sufficient conditions for it to succeed in correctly identifying the worst model. Can you explain these conditions and why they matter? Do you think they can be further tightened or relaxed?

3. The Greedy Triplet Ranking (GTR) method works by incrementally removing the worst model from a triplet and adding the next model, while the Full Triplet Ranking (FTR) method computes reputation scores for each model based on weighted votes from all triplets. Can you contrast these two methods and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages? 

4. For tasks like summarization and dialog systems, why do you think the proposed triplet approach is more suitable than simply taking the most common answer from all models? What are the limitations of the most common answer baseline?

5. The experiments section tests the method on summarization, multiple choice, and dialog tasks. Can you think of other natural language generation tasks where this method could be beneficial? What changes might need to be made to adapt the method?

6. The paper shows the method works well even when model accuracies are as low as 50%, suggesting applicability beyond high-performing LLMs. Do you think there are cases or scenarios where this method would fail or falter?

7. The analysis shows that having a large space of possible incorrect responses helps the method succeed. When would this assumption not hold and how can those cases be detected or handled?  

8. For multiple choice tasks, the method struggles when there are very few possible responses. Intuitively explain this limitation. Do you have ideas to address it?

9. The method evaluates models by having them judge other models without any human involvement. Do you foresee any ethical concerns or limitations with this fully automated approach?

10. The paper focuses on ranking models rather than precisely estimating their accuracies. Do you think the triplet approach can be extended to get accuracy estimates? What additional information might be needed?
