# [Interpretable Multi-View Clustering Based on Anchor Graph Tensor   Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-view clustering (MVC) methods based on anchor graphs are efficient for large-scale data but have limitations: 
    1) Methods that learn bipartite graphs with K connected components have strict parameter requirements and may fail to find K components.  
    2) Methods that use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on anchor graphs lose inter-view spatial structure information which is useful for clustering. 
    3) Existing NMF-based MVC methods lack interpretability of the decomposed matrices.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose an interpretable MVC model based on Anchor Graph Tensor Factorization (AGTF)
    - Extend NMF to Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) on a 3rd order anchor graph tensor to preserve inter-view spatial structure
    - Decomposed tensors provide interpretability:
        - Sample indicator tensor shows cluster membership of samples
        - Anchor indicator tensor shows cluster membership probabilities of anchors
    - Use tensor Schatten p-norm to exploit complementary information across views and achieve common consensus indicator matrix

Key Contributions:
- Extend NMF to NTF on 3rd order tensors, preserving more spatial structure information across views
- Provide interpretations for the sample and anchor indicator tensors from tensor decomposition, enhancing interpretability
- Introduce tensor Schatten p-norm to leverage complementary information between views and obtain common consensus indicator matrix
- Present an optimization algorithm for NTF and prove its convergence to the KKT stationary point
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods

In summary, this paper proposes a novel interpretable multi-view clustering model using anchor graph tensor factorization. Key innovations include extending NMF to NTF on tensors and using tensor Schatten norms to exploit complementary information across views. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
