# [Understanding the Instruction Mixture for Large Language Model   Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) has shown great promise, but the influence of different instruction dataset mixtures on model performance has not been thoroughly studied. 

- Researchers want to endow a single LLM with diverse capabilities by combining specialized instruction datasets, but there is no standard methodology for selecting and mixing datasets.

- Understanding how different types of instructions interact and impact model performance on various benchmarks remains an open research question.

Methods & Contributions 
- The authors classify instruction datasets into 3 types: NLP downstream tasks, coding, and general chatting. They select representative datasets from each category - P3, CodeAlpaca and Alpaca.

- They conduct extensive experiments combining these datasets in 8 different mixtures and evaluating LLaMA-2 models on NLP, coding, and alignment benchmarks.

Key Findings
- Each instruction type consistently improves performance on its corresponding benchmark, while all types enhance NLP task performance.

- Incorporating general chat instructions downgrade alignment skills. Adding coding instructions boosts both coding and alignment abilities.

- Larger models can better leverage diverse instruction mixtures. The optimal mixture ratio depends on model size and intended usage.

- Specialized instructions are vital for good benchmark performance, but general instructions provide better alignment. There are inherent trade-offs to be made.

Implications
- Meticulous instruction dataset design is crucial to maximize performance on target usage while considering model size. 

- LLMs should be evaluated not just on benchmarks but also alignment skills to ensure proper human alignment.

Limitations and Future Work
- Only two LLaMA model sizes were evaluated. More comprehensive analysis needed.

- Limited exploration of impact of larger volumes and mixing ratios of instruction data.
