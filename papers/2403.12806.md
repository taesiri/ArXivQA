# [VisualCritic: Making LMMs Perceive Visual Quality Like Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current large multimodal models (LMMs) lack capability to accurately perceive low-level visual quality aligned with human perception. This limits their versatility and generalizability for visual quality assessment.

- Conventional visual quality assessment models can fit given datasets well but struggle with cross-dataset generalizability, requiring dataset-specific adaptation. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose VisualCritic, the first LMM for broad-spectrum image subjective quality assessment with unprecedented generalization ability and versatility. 

- A multi-stage training strategy is introduced, including (1) relativity learning on diverse data to enable ranking image quality, addressing annotation inconsistency issues, (2) multifunctional training to enable quantitative measurement, qualitative evaluation and authenticity detection, and (3) instruction tuning.  

Main Contributions:
- VisualCritic outperforms other LMMs substantially in quantitative quality measurement over both photographic and AI-generated images across datasets.

- Beyond numerical scores, VisualCritic also enables new capabilities of providing natural language descriptions about perceptual quality and discerning authenticity.

- Compared to conventional specialist models requiring adaptation for different datasets, VisualCritic can be applied out-of-the-box with a single model, showcasing unprecedented generalization ability.

In summary, this paper makes the first endeavor towards enhancing LMMs for perceptual alignment of low-level visual quality. The proposed VisualCritic delivers state-of-the-art performance in cross-dataset generalization and supports more comprehensive functionalities than conventional models.
