## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Planning as In-Painting: A Diffusion-Based Embodied Task Planning Framework for Environments under Uncertainty":

Problem:
Embodied AI agents need to understand instructions and act accordingly in environments that may be partially observable. Task planning remains a key challenge, with no consensus on a unified solution. Modular methods create discontinuities between modules. Large language models may not handle domain-specific tasks well or partial observability. Recently conditional generative models have been applied, but can risk hallucinating plans under uncertainty. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a unified "planning as in-painting" formulation using a denoising diffusion model (DDM) to generate plans conditioned on language instructions and perceptual input. Unlike modeling state-action mappings, they model full state sequences. To improve reliability under partial observability, they jointly model the state trajectory and a goal estimation to reduce dependence on environment biases. They introduce an "on-the-fly" planning algorithm to continually update plans with new observations for better exploration/exploitation balancing.

Contributions:
1) A "planning as in-painting" formulation using a DDM for conditional embodied task planning that is task-agnostic and reliable across different embodied settings, especially partially observable ones.

2) An on-the-fly algorithm collaborating with the DDM planner for better balancing of exploration and exploitation.

3) Experiments across visual-language navigation, object manipulation, and planning in a photo-realistic environment demonstrating effectiveness of the framework and algorithm over RL baselines, prior diffusion policies, and modular methods.

In summary, the key innovation is a unified embodied task planning framework using conditional generative modeling that reliably handles environment uncertainty through jointly modeling plans and goals, paired with an on-the-fly planning algorithm. Experiments verify improved performance across diverse embodied AI tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified embodied AI planning framework called "planning as in-painting" that uses a language-conditioned diffusion model to generate plans conditioned on perceptual inputs and language instructions, as well as an on-the-fly planning algorithm to handle environment uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. It proposes a novel language-conditioned generative policy, dubbed "planning as in-painting", which is able to produce effective planning in partially observable environments. 

2. It introduces an on-the-fly planning algorithm that collaborates with the diffusion-based planner to achieve better exploration and exploitation balance.

3. It conducts experiments and additional analysis to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method across three different embodied AI tasks - visual-language navigation, object manipulation, and task planning in a realistic environment.

In summary, the key contribution is a new framework for embodied AI task planning that can handle environment uncertainty. This is achieved through a diffusion-based model for conditional plan generation, as well as a complementary on-the-fly planning algorithm. Experiments demonstrate improved performance over prior methods on various embodied tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel concept of "planning as in-painting" for embodied AI task planning. Can you explain in more detail the intuition behind this idea and how it is analogous to image in-painting? 

2. The diffusion model is used to generate the future state sequence (plan) conditioned on current observations and instructions. What are the benefits of modeling the plan in the state space rather than the action space?

3. The paper jointly models the state sequence (plan) and goal estimation. Why is modeling the goal estimation helpful, especially in partially observable environments? 

4. Can you explain the on-the-fly planning algorithm in more detail? Why is it useful to continually update the plan as new observations become available? 

5. The method seems quite general and is evaluated on navigation, manipulation and interactive tasks. What modifications or adaptations were required to apply the approach across these different domains?

6. What are the limitations of the 2D planning space used in this work? When would a 3D planning space be necessary instead?  

7. The paper compares against model-free RL, behavioral cloning and prior diffusion policies. What are the key advantages of the proposed approach over each of these methods?

8. What are some ways the on-the-fly planning could be made more efficient? Is it necessary to re-plan from scratch each time?

9. The method struggles with highly complex and diverse natural language instructions. What are some ways the language understanding capabilities could be improved?

10. The approach relies on a semantic mapping to transform sensory observations into compact state representations. What impact does the quality of this semantic mapping have on the final performance?
