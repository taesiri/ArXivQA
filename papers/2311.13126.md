# [Towards Better Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language   Models: A Position Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13126)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in this paper:

This position paper highlights the pressing need for better Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques specifically tailored for Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs like ChatGPT showcase remarkable capabilities, their massive parameter requirements hinder real-world usability. Current PEFT methods like LoRA, adapters, and prompt/prefix-tuning were proposed before the LLM era and are not optimized for them. Through experiments, the authors find LoRA performs best but lacks uniform effectiveness across settings. They then outline open challenges for LLMs needing further research: 1) Novel efficient architectures for distributed training and RLHF fine-tuning; 2) Combining compression techniques like distillation and quantization with PEFT for easier deployment; 3) Multi-modal PEFT to enable cross-modal transfer while preventing catastrophic forgetting; 4) Adaptive methods to automatically search for optimal prompts/ranks based on task difficulty. By summarizing literature and presenting empirical analysis, this paper stimulates discussion on developing more accessible PEFT solutions to unleash the remarkable capabilities of LLMs for real-world usage.
