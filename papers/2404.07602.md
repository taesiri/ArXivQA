# [Attention based End to end network for Offline Writer Identification on   Word level data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing writer identification systems perform well when large amounts of handwritten text are available, such as full pages or paragraphs. However, their performance declines significantly when only word images containing a few letters are available. This is because deep learning models struggle to capture enough writer-specific details from the limited handwriting samples in word images.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an end-to-end convolutional neural network for writer identification using word image fragments. The model has two streams - a writer-dependent stream trained only on writer samples to capture writer-specific details, and a writer-independent stream pretrained on a generic dataset to extract general handwriting features. Image fragments from word images are extracted at multiple scales using the SIFT algorithm and fed to the model. An attention mechanism is also incorporated to focus on salient regions.

Key Contributions:

1) A fragment-based approach where an end-to-end CNN model is trained on image fragments from word images rather than complete words. This captures more writer details compared to models trained on full words.

2) A multi-stream model with writer-dependent and writer-independent streams to extract both writer-specific and general handwriting features robustly.

3) Incorporation of an attention mechanism to allow the model to focus on discriminative parts of the image fragments.

4) Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in writer identification from word images compared to previous approaches. The method is also computationally efficient.

In summary, a fragment-based end-to-end CNN model with attention mechanism is proposed for the challenging task of writer identification from word images. The model outperforms previous approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of the fragment-based training strategy and multi-stream architecture in capturing writer individuality from limited handwriting samples.
