# [Toward Joint Language Modeling for Speech Units and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08715)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions/goals of this paper appear to be:

1) How can text data be effectively utilized to enhance generative spoken language models (GSLMs) trained on discrete speech units? 

2) How can shared representations between speech units and text be learned in a joint language model?

The authors aim to study these questions by:

- Comparing different speech tokenization techniques to transform continuous speech signals into discrete units that can be combined with text data.

- Exploring different methods (CST, AST) to construct mixed speech-text training data to encourage learning of shared representations.

- Developing automatic evaluation metrics (CRA, PELM) to measure the cross-modal ability of joint speech-text language models without fine-tuning.

- Analyzing performance on downstream spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks when fine-tuning on either speech or text to assess transferability between modalities.

The key hypothesis seems to be that by properly mixing speech and text data using their proposed techniques, a joint language model can learn improved representations that exhibit cross-modal ability between speech and text units. The experiments aim to validate whether their techniques achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Presenting a joint autoregressive language model trained on both speech units and text, which to the best of their knowledge is the first of its kind. 

2. Proposing automatic metrics (Context Retrieval Accuracy and Perplexity under External LM) to evaluate the cross-modal ability of speech-text language models without needing to fine-tune the model. The metrics are shown to be indicative of the model's cross-modal transfer performance on downstream tasks.

3. Empirically showing that speech units covering larger spans obtained via SentencePiece tokenization lead to improved performance compared to more local units from self-supervised models like HuBERT.

4. Finding that mixing speech units and text using their proposed concatenation and alternation techniques improves the model's cross-modal ability based on the automatic metrics and downstream task performance. For example, the model shows zero-shot transferability on a sentiment analysis task after fine-tuning.

5. Showing that the joint model improves over a speech-only baseline on spoken language understanding tasks and has the ability to continue a partial sentence prompt from the other modality (cross-modal continuation).

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the development and evaluation of a joint speech-text autoregressive language model using proposed techniques to mix the modalities. The automatic metrics and empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to learn shared representations across speech and text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in joint speech-text modeling:

- This is one of the few papers exploring joint language modeling for speech units and text. Most prior work has focused on mapping between modalities (ASR, TTS) rather than joint modeling. The authors make a good case for why joint modeling could be beneficial.

- The approach builds on prior work in self-supervised speech representations (HuBERT) and textless NLP, but extends those approaches by incorporating text data. So it demonstrates how text can help improve speech-only models.

- Compared to other speech-text joint models like SPLAT, Maestro, and SpeechT5, this paper explores a decoder-only transformer architecture rather than encoder-decoder or encoder-only architectures. The motivation is that decoder-only models are simpler to train and more versatile. This is a unique aspect compared to prior work.

- The paper introduces automatic metrics like Context Retrieval Accuracy (CRA) and Perplexity under External LM (PELM) to evaluate cross-modal ability. This provides model-based ways to evaluate joint speech-text models that don't require fine-tuning. Other papers have relied more on fine-tuning for evaluation.

- For empirical evaluation, the paper utilizes the SLUE benchmark. Many prior speech-text papers have not evaluated on standard SLU benchmarks, so this allows more direct comparison to other methods.

- The model architecture and dataset scale explored is relatively small compared to state-of-the-art LLMs. The findings may not directly transfer when scaling up, which is a limitation.

In summary, the paper makes a novel contribution in studying decoder-only transformer models for joint speech-text modeling. The proposed techniques and evaluation metrics provide useful tools and insights that advance this research direction. More work is still needed to understand how well this approach scales up.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating the optimal balance between speech and text data in model training. The authors studied the joint modeling of speech units and text with a certain proportion of speech and text data. They suggest exploring how varying this balance could impact results. 

- Exploring ways to handle multi-modal data beyond the speech-text domain. The current work focused solely on speech and text modalities. The authors propose extending this approach to model other modalities jointly as well, such as images, video, etc.

- Scaling up the model size. The authors experimented with relatively small models and mention it is unclear how scaling up would affect the results. Examining the impact of larger model sizes on joint speech-text modeling is proposed.

- Trying alternative fine-tuning approaches for downstream tasks. The authors used a simple fine-tuning method but suggest investigating other techniques that can better handle issues like trivial tasks and length mismatch between modalities.

- Testing the approach on more downstream tasks. Only two SLUE benchmark tasks were used for evaluation. Expanding the experiments to more tasks would provide further insights into the model's capabilities.

- Using the techniques for multilingual modeling. The current work focused on English, but the authors propose applying it in multilingual settings.

- Leveraging recent advances in speech recognition to automate transcription of speech data, reducing the need for paired speech-text data.

- Extending the approach to use multiple sentences as context instead of the single-sentence modeling done so far. 

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are centered around scaling up the model, testing it in more diverse and challenging settings, and devising techniques to improve joint modeling of speech and text.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a joint language model trained on both speech units and text to bridge the gap between text-only and speech-only language models. The authors compare different speech tokenizers to transform continuous speech into discrete units, including using a pre-trained HuBERT model and further combining the units with a SentencePiece tokenizer. They mix the speech units and text in different ways, including simple concatenation (CST) and alternating between modalities at word boundaries (AST). Evaluation involves proposed automatic metrics to measure cross-modal ability without fine-tuning, as well as fine-tuning on spoken language understanding tasks with different input modalities. Key findings are that the joint model improves over speech-only baselines and shows zero-shot cross-modal transferability on downstream tasks when mixing speech and text using the proposed techniques. Specifically, SentencePiece tokenization of speech improves over raw HuBERT units, and AST encourages shared representations. The model shows the ability to continue prompts in a different modality and benefits from text data on spoken language understanding tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper explores joint language modeling for speech units and text. Specifically, the authors compare different speech tokenizers to transform continuous speech signals into discrete units and use different methods to construct mixed speech-text data. They introduce automatic metrics to evaluate how well the joint language model mixes speech and text, including Context Retrieval Accuracy (CRA) and Perplexity under External LM (PELM). The joint language model is also fine-tuned on downstream spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks to assess its ability to learn shared representations between speech and text. 

The results show that combining speech units and text with the proposed techniques enables the model to learn shared representations and improve over a speech-only baseline. The model exhibits zero-shot cross-modal transferability on a sentiment analysis task after fine-tuning. On a named entity recognition task, it outperforms models trained with only speech data. The empirical results also demonstrate that units covering larger spans obtained through SentencePiece tokenization lead to better performance compared to more local units from self-supervised models. Overall, the study provides insights on effectively utilizing both speech and text data for more comprehensive language modeling.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a joint language model for speech units and text (SUTLM). They first tokenize continuous speech signals into discrete units using a self-supervised speech model called HuBERT. They find that combining the speech units into larger chunks using a subword tokenizer like SentencePiece leads to better performance. To train the SUTLM, they format unpaired speech and text data, as well as paired speech-text data, into sequences of tokens that can contain both speech units and text (examples are shown in Table 1). The model is trained to predict the next token given its context by maximizing the log probability. They propose automatic metrics like Context Retrieval Accuracy and Perplexity under External LM to evaluate the model's ability to handle both speech and text without fine-tuning. They also fine-tune the model on spoken language understanding tasks with speech/text inputs to assess whether it learns shared representations across modalities. Overall, the proposed techniques of concatenating and alternating speech and text are shown to improve the model's cross-modal ability based on the automatic metrics and fine-tuning evaluations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding, the main point of this paper is to explore joint language modeling of speech units and text by combining discrete speech representations with written text in an autoregressive language model. The authors compare different techniques for representing speech as discrete units, formatting mixed speech and text data, and evaluating the cross-modal ability of the resulting models. The key findings seem to be:

- Converting speech to discrete units using SentencePiece tokenization over phone-level units from a HuBERT model improves coherence and downstream performance. 

- Simply concatenating speech and text is not enough to learn shared representations across modalities - explicitly alternating speech and text units works better.

- The proposed joint models show improved performance on spoken language understanding tasks compared to speech-only models, and enable cross-modal zero-shot transfer between speech and text.

In summary, the paper demonstrates techniques to effectively combine speech and text data to build joint language models with improved representation learning across modalities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the following main problem/question: 

How to effectively model speech and text jointly in a single language model, with a focus on learning shared representations across modalities.

Some more specific questions they seem to be exploring:

- How can additional text data be utilized to enhance speech unit language models?

- What is the best way to transform continuous speech signals into discrete units for combining with text data in a joint model? They compare different speech tokenizers.

- What are effective techniques for formatting/mixing the speech and text data to enable learning of shared representations? They explore concatenated and alternating speech-text formats. 

- How can they evaluate the cross-modal ability of the joint speech-text language model? They propose automatic metrics that don't require fine-tuning.

- How does mixing speech and text data affect performance on downstream spoken language understanding tasks? They fine-tune and evaluate on sentiment analysis and named entity recognition tasks.

So in summary, the key focus seems to be on techniques and evaluations for joint modeling of speech and text, with the goal of learning representations that capture both modalities. The paper aims to demonstrate benefits of leveraging additional text data for speech modeling and enabling cross-modal transfer between speech and text.
