# [Why Not Use Your Textbook? Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning of   Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on procedure planning in instructional videos, which involves generating a logical sequence of action steps to reach a desired goal state based on an initial and final visual state. This is a challenging task due to:

1) Implicit temporal and causal constraints in the sequencing of steps
2) Existence of numerous viable plans for the same start and goal states  
3) Need to incorporate real-world procedural knowledge to manage variability in transition probabilities between steps

Prior works have attempted to address these challenges by using heavy supervision signals like intermediate visual states, step descriptions, or task labels. However, these intricacies are not fully resolved.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning (KEPP) system to infuse procedural knowledge into the planning agent. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a Probabilistic Procedure Knowledge Graph (P^2KG) from the training plans to capture step sequencing constraints, variability and real-world priors. This serves as an in-domain "textbook".

2) Decompose the planning problem into i) predicting start and end steps from input visual states more reliably ii) retrieve procedure recommendations from P^2KG conditioned on predicted start and end steps iii) final planning based on recommendations.

By prioritizing reliable information and integrating procedural knowledge, KEPP enhances planning effectiveness even with minimal supervision of just the ground truth plan.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of KEPP - first procedure planning method in instructional videos incorporating procedural knowledge via P^2KG without needing extra annotations

2) Effective problem decomposition strategy to prioritize reliable predictions and integrate knowledge 

3) Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance across 3 datasets. KEPP delivered gains of 5-6% in success rate over previous best method.

In summary, this paper puts forth an innovative knowledge-enhanced planning approach for instructional videos that attains superior accuracy while requiring only minimal supervision. The integration of procedural knowledge is the main distinguishing factor.
