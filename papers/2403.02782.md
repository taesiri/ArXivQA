# [Why Not Use Your Textbook? Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning of   Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on procedure planning in instructional videos, which involves generating a logical sequence of action steps to reach a desired goal state based on an initial and final visual state. This is a challenging task due to:

1) Implicit temporal and causal constraints in the sequencing of steps
2) Existence of numerous viable plans for the same start and goal states  
3) Need to incorporate real-world procedural knowledge to manage variability in transition probabilities between steps

Prior works have attempted to address these challenges by using heavy supervision signals like intermediate visual states, step descriptions, or task labels. However, these intricacies are not fully resolved.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning (KEPP) system to infuse procedural knowledge into the planning agent. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a Probabilistic Procedure Knowledge Graph (P^2KG) from the training plans to capture step sequencing constraints, variability and real-world priors. This serves as an in-domain "textbook".

2) Decompose the planning problem into i) predicting start and end steps from input visual states more reliably ii) retrieve procedure recommendations from P^2KG conditioned on predicted start and end steps iii) final planning based on recommendations.

By prioritizing reliable information and integrating procedural knowledge, KEPP enhances planning effectiveness even with minimal supervision of just the ground truth plan.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of KEPP - first procedure planning method in instructional videos incorporating procedural knowledge via P^2KG without needing extra annotations

2) Effective problem decomposition strategy to prioritize reliable predictions and integrate knowledge 

3) Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance across 3 datasets. KEPP delivered gains of 5-6% in success rate over previous best method.

In summary, this paper puts forth an innovative knowledge-enhanced planning approach for instructional videos that attains superior accuracy while requiring only minimal supervision. The integration of procedural knowledge is the main distinguishing factor.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a knowledge-enhanced procedure planning system called KEPP that utilizes a probabilistic procedural knowledge graph derived from training videos and may incorporate insights from large language models to guide an agent in strategically constructing multi-step plans to achieve goal states depicted in instructional videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new method called \ourseos (Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning) for procedure planning in instructional videos. This method utilizes a probabilistic procedural knowledge graph (P$^2$KG) extracted from training procedure plans to enhance the agent's capability in handling complexities of step sequencing and variations.

2. Decomposing the procedure planning problem into two parts - predicting the initial and final steps based on start and end visual states, and then creating a full plan using procedural knowledge retrieved from the P$^2$KG conditioned on the predicted first and last steps. This prioritizes the most reliable information and effectively incorporates procedural knowledge into planning.

3. Experimental evaluations on three datasets demonstrating that the proposed \ours method achieves superior, state-of-the-art performance in procedure planning using only a minimal level of supervision.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing procedure planning in instructional videos by extracting and leveraging procedural knowledge, while requiring less supervision than prior arts. The proposed \ourseos method sets new state-of-the-art results across three datasets.
