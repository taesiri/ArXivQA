# [DPOK: Reinforcement Learning for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16381)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, this paper appears to address the following main research questions/hypotheses:1. Can reinforcement learning (RL) be effectively used to fine-tune pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to better optimize alignment with human preferences captured in a learned reward model? The authors propose framing the fine-tuning task as an RL problem, where policy gradient is used to update the text-to-image model to maximize expected reward from a human feedback-trained model like ImageReward. This is contrasted with supervised learning approaches.2. Can regularization techniques like KL divergence to the original pre-trained model help maintain fidelity/quality while improving alignment during RL fine-tuning?The authors incorporate KL divergence to the pre-trained model as a regularization term during RL fine-tuning to avoid overfitting to the reward model in a way that excessively compromises image quality.3. How does online RL fine-tuning compare to supervised fine-tuning on metrics like image quality and alignment? The authors empirically compare RL and supervised fine-tuning and analyze the tradeoffs. Key differences highlighted include the ability of RL to explore off-distribution and better leverage the generalization of the reward model.In summary, the central hypotheses appear to be that RL can more effectively fine-tune text-to-image models than supervised approaches to improve alignment without sacrificing quality, and that techniques like online KL regularization are important enablers of this. The empirical analyses aim to support these claims.
