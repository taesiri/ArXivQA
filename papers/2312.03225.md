# [Snake Robot with Tactile Perception Navigates on Large-scale Challenging   Terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03225)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) control framework to enable snake robots with full-body tactile sensing capabilities to autonomously navigate challenging, uneven terrains. The approach uses a high-level A* planner to globally plan efficient paths to goal locations. These paths are divided into waypoints that local controllers, trained using curriculum learning, can navigate between by modulating snake locomotion gaits. The key novelty is the integration of tactile signals to help the robot locally adapt its gaits like sidewinding, lateral rolling, etc. to match the terrain. This is achieved by having decentralized "Adaptor" modules that select appropriate pre-trained gaits from a library based solely on local tactile patterns from adjacent body links. Training uses a distributed framework to accelerate learning. Experiments in complex simulated cave environments demonstrate superior traversal efficiency over baselines, benefiting from tactile-based terrain adaptations like avoiding falls when uphill climbing. The work's significance lies in enabling snake robots to leverage full-body tactile feedback for robust autonomous navigation in challenging uneven environments.
