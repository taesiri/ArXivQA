# [ConSlide: Asynchronous Hierarchical Interaction Transformer with   Breakup-Reorganize Rehearsal for Continual Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13324)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research focus seems to be developing a continual learning framework for whole slide image (WSI) analysis to tackle the issues of catastrophic forgetting when sequentially trained on new datasets. The main hypotheses appear to be:1) A specifically designed hierarchical architecture can better model and utilize the multi-resolution nature of WSIs compared to standard CNNs or Transformers. 2) A rehearsal-based continual learning strategy of storing, reorganizing and replaying representative WSI regions can help mitigate catastrophic forgetting.3) An asynchronous training approach that encourages different parts of the network to update at different rates can support more stable continual learning.Specifically, the paper proposes a new framework called "ConSlide" with three key components to address these hypotheses:1) A Hierarchical Interaction Transformer (HIT) backbone to model the hierarchical structure of WSIs.2) A Breakup-Reorganize (BuRo) rehearsal module to efficiently store and replay WSI regions. 3) An asynchronous updating mechanism based on Cross-Scale Similarity Learning to encourage different training rates.The central research questions seem to revolve around whether this overall ConSlide framework and its components can enable effective continual learning on sequential WSI datasets while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The experiments aim to validate the design through comparisons to other WSI analysis and continual learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes the first continual learning framework for whole slide image (WSI) analysis, named ConSlide, to tackle the challenges of huge image size, efficient utilization of hierarchical structure, and catastrophic forgetting in an evolving environment with sequentially incoming datasets. 2. It designs a novel Hierarchical Interaction Transformer (HIT) architecture to efficiently model and utilize the hierarchical characteristic of WSIs via bidirectional interaction between patch- and region-level features.3. It develops a new Breakup-Reorganize (BuRo) rehearsal method specifically for WSI data replay, which stores regions efficiently and reorganizes augmented WSIs to improve knowledge fidelity.4. It devises an asynchronous updating mechanism based on a Cross-Scale Similarity Learning module to encourage patch- and region-level blocks to learn generic and task-specific knowledge respectively during replay.5. It evaluates ConSlide on four public WSI datasets and shows its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods in a fair WSI continual learning setting, with better overall performance and less forgetting of previous tasks.In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in proposing the first solution tailored for continual learning on whole slide images, with careful designs of the hierarchical architecture, rehearsal strategy, and asynchronous updating mechanism to address the unique challenges of gigapixel WSI data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a continual learning framework for whole slide image analysis called ConSlide that uses a hierarchical interaction transformer architecture, a breakup-reorganize rehearsal method, and asynchronous updating to mitigate catastrophic forgetting when sequentially training on multiple pathology image datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a new continual learning framework for whole slide image (WSI) analysis, using a rehearsal-based approach with an attention mechanism. Most prior work on continual learning for medical imaging has focused on smaller natural images or MRI/X-ray data, not large histopathology WSIs. So this paper proposes one of the first methods for continual learning on gigapixel WSIs.- The paper introduces two main novel components - the Hierarchical Interaction Transformer (HIT) architecture to model WSIs, and the Breakup-Reorganize (BuRo) rehearsal method for efficient replay of regions from prior tasks. Other recent works have used CNNs or standard vision Transformers for WSI analysis, without explicit modeling of the hierarchical structure. The rehearsal approach is also tailored specifically to WSIs rather than generic images.- The asynchronous updating scheme was inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems theory from neuroscience, an approach which has been adopted in a few other continual learning works. However, the paper adapts this idea uniquely for hierarchical WSIs and defines a novel Cross-Scale Similarity Learning method to realize asynchronous updates.- The experiments comprehensively compare the proposed ConSlide framework against several state-of-the-art continual learning methods adapted for WSI analysis. The results demonstrate superior performance over regularization and rehearsal baselines on a multi-class tumor classification benchmark across four different WSI datasets.- One limitation is that the evaluation was done on a controlled tumor classification scenario. Additional experiments could further analyze the approach on more diverse WSI analysis tasks. But overall, this paper presents an important first step for continual learning on gigapixel histopathology data.In summary, the key novelty and contributions are in designing specialized model components and learning strategies tailored for continual learning on the challenging problem of whole slide image analysis. The paper advances the state-of-the-art for this emerging research area.
