# [Backdoor Attacks on Dense Passage Retrievers for Disseminating   Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Backdoor Attacks on Dense Passage Retrievers for Disseminating Misinformation":

Problem:
The paper investigates potential vulnerabilities in dense passage retrieval (DPR) systems, which are widely used to retrieve relevant passages from a corpus given a user query. Specifically, it explores a concerning attack scenario where attackers can inject targeted misinformation into the retrieval corpus. When users unintentionally make grammatical errors in their queries, this triggers the system to return the attacker-specified misinformation passages instead of relevant results.   

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack using grammatical errors as triggers. The attack has two stages - during training, the model is trained on a poisoned dataset containing queries and passages with intentional grammar errors (dataset poisoning). This allows the model to learn the triggering patterns. During inference, a small set of passages containing misinformation are injected into the corpus with grammar errors (corpus poisoning). Now when users make errors in their queries, the passages with misinformation are ranked higher.

Key Contributions:
- First work highlighting security vulnerabilities in dense retrievers using backdoor attacks.
- Use of grammatical errors as triggers allows stealthy attacks that activate only for erroneous queries, making them hard to detect. 
- Effectiveness demonstrated through extensive experiments - top retrieved passages contain misinformation for 72-82% of erroneous queries depending on the dataset.
- Analysis of different training strategies shows models trained only on hard negatives are most vulnerable.
- Broad range of error types used as triggers makes attacks widely applicable and harder to defend.

In summary, the paper presents dangerous yet covert backdoor attacks on DPR using grammar errors as triggers. It highlights an important security concern and provides analysis to stimulate further research into safer retrieval systems.
