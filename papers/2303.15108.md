# [High-fidelity 3D Human Digitization from Single 2K Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15108)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is how to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D human models from single 2K resolution images. The key hypotheses are:

1. High-quality 3D human body reconstruction requires high-fidelity and large-scale training data and appropriate network design that can effectively exploit high-resolution input images. 

2. By constructing a large-scale 2K human dataset and designing networks to infer 3D human models from 2K resolution images, it is possible to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D human models from single images.

3. Separately recovering the global shape and details of the human body through different networks can produce accurate 3D models. Predicting the global structure from low-resolution images and the details from high-resolution part-wise images is more effective.

4. Aligning body parts to canonical poses makes the network robust to pose variations while excluding background regions reduces memory requirements. This enables handling high-resolution inputs.

5. Predicting part-wise surface normals and merging them to guide high-resolution depth prediction alleviates scale ambiguity and produces consistent depth maps.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that with appropriately designed networks and large-scale high-resolution training data, high-fidelity 3D human digitization from single 2K images is achievable. The method proposes and verifies this hypothesis.
