# [High-fidelity 3D Human Digitization from Single 2K Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15108)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question that this paper addresses is how to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D human models from single 2K resolution images. The key hypotheses are:

1. High-quality 3D human body reconstruction requires high-fidelity and large-scale training data and appropriate network design that can effectively exploit high-resolution input images. 

2. By constructing a large-scale 2K human dataset and designing networks to infer 3D human models from 2K resolution images, it is possible to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D human models from single images.

3. Separately recovering the global shape and details of the human body through different networks can produce accurate 3D models. Predicting the global structure from low-resolution images and the details from high-resolution part-wise images is more effective.

4. Aligning body parts to canonical poses makes the network robust to pose variations while excluding background regions reduces memory requirements. This enables handling high-resolution inputs.

5. Predicting part-wise surface normals and merging them to guide high-resolution depth prediction alleviates scale ambiguity and produces consistent depth maps.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that with appropriately designed networks and large-scale high-resolution training data, high-fidelity 3D human digitization from single 2K images is achievable. The method proposes and verifies this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They propose a new method called 2K2K for high-fidelity 3D human digitization from single 2K resolution images. 

2. They build a large-scale dataset of over 2000 high-quality 3D human scans and use it to train their model. This helps with generating more accurate reconstructions.

3. They introduce a part-wise image-to-normal network that predicts surface normals for different body parts separately. This allows handling high resolution inputs more efficiently. 

4. They demonstrate high quality 3D human reconstructions on their dataset as well as other datasets like RenderPeople and THuman2.0. Their method shows competitive or better performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

5. They release their dataset of 2050 3D human models along with texture maps, 3D joints, and SMPL parameters to aid further research in this area.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing a new method for high fidelity 3D human reconstruction from high resolution single images, building a large high quality dataset to train it, and demonstrating improved performance over existing methods. The part-wise prediction scheme and release of the dataset are also valuable additions.
