# [Point2Mask: Point-supervised Panoptic Segmentation via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01779)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can high-quality panoptic segmentation be achieved using only a single random point annotation per target for training?The authors propose an effective method called Point2Mask to address this question. The key ideas are:- Formulating the panoptic pseudo-mask generation as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem, where each ground-truth point label and pixel sample are defined as the label supplier and consumer respectively.- Defining the transportation cost based on introduced task-oriented maps that focus on category-wise and instance-wise differences. - Proposing a centroid-based scheme to accurately set the unit number for each ground-truth point supplier in the OT formulation.- Converting the pseudo-mask generation into finding the optimal transport plan at globally minimal cost, which can be efficiently solved via Sinkhorn-Knopp iteration.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by formulating pseudo-mask generation as an OT problem with proper transport cost definition and unit number calculation, high-quality panoptic segmentation can be achieved with only single point supervision per target during training. The Point2Mask method is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Point2Mask for weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation using only a single point annotation per target during training. Specifically, the key points are:- They formulate the panoptic pseudo-mask generation as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem, where each ground truth (gt) point label and pixel sample are defined as the label supplier and consumer respectively. - They introduce task-oriented maps, including category-wise semantic map and instance-wise boundary map, to calculate the transportation cost that focuses on category-wise and instance-wise differences.- They propose a centroid-based scheme to accurately set the unit number for each gt point supplier in the defined OT problem. - The pseudo-mask generation is converted to finding the optimal transport plan at globally minimal cost, which is solved efficiently via Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration.- The panoptic segmentation sub-network is trained with the generated pseudo-masks in a fully-supervised manner. Only this sub-network is retained during inference.- Experiments on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate promising performance of the proposed Point2Mask approach for point-supervised panoptic segmentation, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the key contribution is formulating the pseudo-mask generation for point-supervised panoptic segmentation as a global Optimal Transport problem and proposing effective solutions to solve it. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the Point2Mask method.
