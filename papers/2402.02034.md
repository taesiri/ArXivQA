# [Universal Post-Training Reverse-Engineering Defense Against Backdoors in   Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries poison the training data to insert malicious backdoors. This causes the model to misclassify inputs with the backdoor trigger to a target label chosen by the attacker.

- Existing defenses either make assumptions about the backdoor incorporation method or have high complexity. There is a need for a post-training defense that can reliably detect backdoors without knowing the exact attack method used, while being computationally efficient.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new defense method called CEPA that detects backdoors by estimating a consensus perturbation pattern in the DNN's internal feature layers that corresponds to the backdoor trigger. 

- CEPA formulates an optimization problem to find minimal input perturbations that cause misclassification to a target class while inducing a common internal feature perturbation. It alternates between updating the input perturbations and re-estimating the common feature perturbation.

- The defense relies on two key observations: (1) the backdoor causes overfitting detectable via large internal activations (2) different trigger patterns induce a common internal representation that CEPA reverse engineers.  

Main Contributions:
- CEPA is among the first defenses to reliably detect backdoors without assumptions on the attack method by reverse engineering the trigger pattern from the DNN's own features.

- It demonstrates empirically that different backdoor attacks lead to a consensus internal representation that enables agnostic detection. The method achieves strong detection performance on BadNets, WaNet, blending and additive backdoors.

- CEPA has low complexity with very few hyperparameters, demonstrating it can scale well. It also visually reconstructs estimated backdoor triggers.

- The work helps advance backdoor explainability and interpretability by identifying internal model signals that correspond to malicious perturbations. The insights can aid further research into universal trigger reverse engineering.
