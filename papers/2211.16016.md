# [UDE: A Unified Driving Engine for Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16016)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be how to develop a unified driving engine that can generate realistic and controllable human motion sequences from both natural language text and audio input. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that it is possible to build a single model that can generate human motions from different modalities (text and audio) in a unified framework, rather than having separate text-to-motion and audio-to-motion models. The unified model is expected to enable smooth transitions between motions generated from language instructions vs rhythmic motions generated from music, allow easy editing by modifying the text or audio inputs, and improve overall quality and diversity of generated motions.

The paper proposes a unified driving engine (UDE) with four main components:

1) A motion quantization module that represents motions as discrete tokens from a learned codebook. 

2) A modality-agnostic encoder that maps text and audio inputs to a common latent space.

3) A transformer-based module to predict motion token sequences from the latent embeddings.

4) A diffusion-based decoder to convert the discrete tokens back to continuous motion sequences with diversity.

By training these components jointly in an end-to-end fashion on both text-to-motion and audio-to-motion data, the model aims to generate high-quality and controllable human motions from either text or audio inputs using the same underlying framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified framework called UDE (Unified Driving Engine) that can generate human motion sequences from both natural language descriptions and audio sequences. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Proposing a motion quantization module based on VQVAE to represent continuous motion as discrete tokens. 

2. Developing a modality-agnostic transformer encoder (MATE) that maps different modalities (text, audio) to a joint embedding space. 

3. Using a unified token transformer (UTT) to predict the quantized motion token sequence in an auto-regressive manner.

4. Introducing a diffusion motion decoder (DMD) to decode the predicted tokens into diverse and high-quality motion sequences. 

5. Showing that UDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on both text-driven and audio-driven human motion generation benchmarks.

6. Demonstrating that a single unified model can achieve strong performance on multiple modalities compared to modality-specific models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a unified framework UDE that generates human motions from both language and audio through discrete motion token prediction and diffusion-based decoding. The unified model performs better than specialized models on each modality.
