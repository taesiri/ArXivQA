# [A New Machine Learning Dataset of Bulldog Nostril Images for Stenosis   Degree Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Brachycephalic dog breeds such as French Bulldogs suffer from a respiratory disorder called Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS) due to their flat-faced appearance. One symptom is different degrees of nostril stenosis that causes breathing difficulties and reduces their well-being. Currently, veterinarians manually classify stenosis degrees (mild, moderate, severe) but this is challenging even for experts. There are no previous image datasets for automatically classifying nostril stenosis degrees using machine learning.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors created a new annotated image dataset of 190 images showing French Bulldog nostrils with different stenosis degrees - 56 mild, 66 moderate, 65 severe and 3 non-stenotic. This is the first dataset addressing this problem.

- They evaluated different deep neural networks for automatically classifying stenosis degree: ResNet50, MobileNetV3, DenseNet201, SwinV2 and MaxViT. The problem was modeled in two ways:
  1) 3-class classification of mild/moderate/severe stenosis
  2) Binary classification of severe vs non-severe

- State-of-the-art data augmentation and Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization was used to boost performance.  

Results: 
- For 3-class classification, MobileNetV3+SAM optimization achieved the best median F1-score of 53.77%. 
- For binary classification, ResNet50+SAM achieved the best median F-score of 72.08%.

- There is difficulty in accurately classifying moderate stenosis. Low-quality images also challenge the models.

Main contributions:
- First image dataset for stenosis degree classification to enable further research
- Proof-of-concept that deep learning could automatically classify nostril stenosis, assisting veterinarians and owners
- Evaluation of multiple modern deep neural networks using optimal optimization for this problem

The results indicate solving this problem is challenging but tractable. The models and dataset lay the foundation for larger models and datasets to accurately classify nostril stenosis in future.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a new dataset of 190 images of bulldog nostrils with stenosis annotations and investigates deep learning models for classifying stenosis degree, achieving best median f-scores of 53.77% on 3-class and 72.08% on binary classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Presentation of a new annotated dataset of 190 images of bulldog nostrils with varying degrees of stenosis (mild, moderate, severe). This is claimed to be the first image dataset addressing stenosis degree classification in dogs.

2) Investigation of deep learning as an approach to automatically infer stenosis degree from nostril images. Several neural network architectures were evaluated, including CNNs (ResNet50, MobileNetV3, DenseNet201) and transformers (SwinV2, MaxViT). 

3) Formulation and evaluation of the problem in two ways: (a) as a 3-class classification task (mild, moderate, severe stenosis) and (b) as a binary classification task (severe vs non-severe). For the multi-class case, the best median F1 score achieved was 53.77\% with MobileNetV3. For the binary case, the best median F1 was 72.08\% with ResNet50.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) a new datasets for this problem, (2) investigation of deep learning to predict stenosis degree, and (3) evaluations on multi-class and binary formulations of the task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using deep learning as an alternative to automatically infer stenosis degree. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using deep learning compared to more traditional machine learning approaches for this application? 

2. The paper evaluates five different neural network architectures. What are the key differences between these architectures and what motivated the authors to evaluate such a diverse set?

3. Data augmentation is mentioned as being heavily used. What types of data augmentation techniques were utilized and why were they focused on color transformations? How might additional data augmentation strategies have impacted performance?

4. The optimization technique Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is used in conjunction with some architectures. Explain how SAM works and why it would be expected to improve generalization performance. 

5. For the multi-class classification problem, the MobileNetV3 optimized with SAM SGD achieved the best metrics. Analyze the confusion matrix shown for this model - what does it suggest about which classes were most challenging?

6. For the binary classification problem, ResNet50 with Adagrad optimization performed best. How did converting to a binary problem seem to change the behavior and improve performance of this model compared to the MobileNetV3?

7. There is class imbalance present in the dataset. Discuss whether this could have influenced model performance and how it might have been addressed during training.

8. Several examples of incorrectly classified images are shown for the best models. What factors make these challenging cases for an image-based stenotic degree classification system? 

9. The paper mentions the potential for a smartphone-based system. How might a deep learning model trained on these data need to be adapted or re-trained to work reliably in a real-world smartphone application?

10. Beyond model performance, discuss what other practical factors should be considered before deploying a deep learning solution for stenotic degree diagnosis to production such as computational efficiency, model interpretation, and testing for dataset biases.
