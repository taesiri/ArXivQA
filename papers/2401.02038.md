# [Understanding LLMs: A Comprehensive Overview from Training to Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Overview
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have seen rapidly increasing use for various downstream tasks. There is now great interest in more cost-efficient training and deployment of LLMs. This paper reviews techniques for low-cost training and inference deployment of LLMs.

Background 
- LLMs evolved from early statistical language models to neural language models and more recently pre-trained language models based on architectures like ELMo's LSTM and the Transformer. Scaling up models and data leads to the "emergence" phenomenon where models exhibit strong language understanding and generation abilities. 

- Release of ChatGPT by OpenAI represents a pivotal moment for LLMs. However reliance on OpenAI's infrastructure motivates building alternative LLMs, especially domain-specific ones, which requires expertise in large-scale data and distributed training.

Training LLMs
- Training has 3 main steps - data preparation, pre-training, and fine-tuning. Datasets come from diverse sources like web text, books, code. Preprocessing like deduplication and privacy scrubbing is key.  

- All LLMs use Transformer architectures. Training leverages parallelism techniques like data, model, tensor and pipeline parallelism mixed precision, ZeRO optimization and checkpointing.

- Fine-tuning uses supervised methods, alignment tuning, and parameter-efficient tuning like adapter tuning. Safety fine-tuning is also critical before deployment.

Inference with LLMs
- Key goals are minimizing compute and memory. Common techniques include knowledge distillation, model pruning/quantization, low-rank approximation, memory scheduling between CPU and GPU, and optimizations like FlashAttention.

Applications
- Production use involves prompting via in-context learning or chain of thought. Open source LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 enable local deployment. Domain customization by fine-tuning is also possible.

Future Trends
- Directions include expanding scale and multimodality, efficient training and inference methods, domain-specific tuning, potential for alternate architectures like RNN, need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and establishing ethical standards.
