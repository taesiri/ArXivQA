# [Deep Image Harmonization with Globally Guided Feature Transformation and   Relation Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve deep image harmonization by better utilizing global image information and providing intermediate supervision? Specifically, the paper proposes two main contributions to address this:1) Globally guided feature transformation (GIFT). Previous methods have transformed foreground features using only local information within each feature map. This paper proposes to use a global feature vector extracted from the image to guide the transformation of foreground features in each local feature map. 2) Relation distillation. Most image harmonization methods only use final pixel-level supervision. This paper proposes an additional loss to provide intermediate supervision on encoder features, by distilling foreground-background relation from a pretrained reconstruction network to the harmonization network.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that utilizing global guidance for feature transformation and adding intermediate relation supervision can significantly improve deep image harmonization performance. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis, showing improved results over state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new method called GiftNet for image harmonization, which uses global feature guidance and relation distillation. 2. It introduces a new dataset called ccHarmony for image harmonization, which simulates natural illumination variation by transferring foreground colors based on images with color checkers. 3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GiftNet over previous methods on benchmark datasets. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of global guidance and relation distillation.4. The proposed ccHarmony dataset offers a new perspective for constructing image harmonization datasets to approximate natural illumination variation.In summary, the key innovations are the globally guided feature transformation, relation distillation, and the ccHarmony dataset construction method. Both the proposed method and dataset advance the image harmonization research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a deep image harmonization method that uses global image features to guide foreground feature transformation and distills foreground-background relation from real images to provide supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
