# [Deep Image Harmonization with Globally Guided Feature Transformation and   Relation Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve deep image harmonization by better utilizing global image information and providing intermediate supervision? Specifically, the paper proposes two main contributions to address this:1) Globally guided feature transformation (GIFT). Previous methods have transformed foreground features using only local information within each feature map. This paper proposes to use a global feature vector extracted from the image to guide the transformation of foreground features in each local feature map. 2) Relation distillation. Most image harmonization methods only use final pixel-level supervision. This paper proposes an additional loss to provide intermediate supervision on encoder features, by distilling foreground-background relation from a pretrained reconstruction network to the harmonization network.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that utilizing global guidance for feature transformation and adding intermediate relation supervision can significantly improve deep image harmonization performance. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis, showing improved results over state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new method called GiftNet for image harmonization, which uses global feature guidance and relation distillation. 2. It introduces a new dataset called ccHarmony for image harmonization, which simulates natural illumination variation by transferring foreground colors based on images with color checkers. 3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GiftNet over previous methods on benchmark datasets. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of global guidance and relation distillation.4. The proposed ccHarmony dataset offers a new perspective for constructing image harmonization datasets to approximate natural illumination variation.In summary, the key innovations are the globally guided feature transformation, relation distillation, and the ccHarmony dataset construction method. Both the proposed method and dataset advance the image harmonization research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a deep image harmonization method that uses global image features to guide foreground feature transformation and distills foreground-background relation from real images to provide supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of image harmonization:- This paper proposes two main novelties - globally guided feature transformation using a GIFT module, and relation distillation between a reconstruction branch and harmonization branch. Both of these are relatively new ideas for image harmonization.- Most prior work has focused on designing separate processing pathways or attention modules for the foreground vs background. This paper takes a different approach by using global guidance and relation distillation.- The idea of using global features to guide local transformations has some similarity to the CDTNet paper, but CDTNet used global features for color transformations while this paper uses global features to modulate convolutional weights for feature transformations.- The use of knowledge distillation/relation distillation between two network branches is novel for image harmonization. Prior work has not explored distilling relations rather than just feature activations.- The proposed ccHarmony dataset provides a new way to generate training data for harmonization by simulating natural illumination variations, as opposed to other common approaches like compositing foregrounds onto random backgrounds.- Overall, the proposed techniques achieve state-of-the-art results on the iHarmony benchmark, demonstrating their effectiveness. The ideas are relatively unique compared to prior art.In summary, this paper introduces globally guided feature transformation and relation distillation which are new techniques for image harmonization, achieving improved results over prior work. The ccHarmony dataset also provides a novel training data generation process for this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions:- Using a larger dataset for training and evaluation. The authors note that the collected dataset in the paper is relatively small, so training on a larger dataset could help improve performance. They suggest collecting more images with color checkers to expand the ccHarmony dataset.- Exploring different ways to represent and distill foreground-background relation knowledge. The relation distillation method in the paper uses averaged foreground feature and similarity map. The authors suggest investigating other relation characterization and distillation methods. - Applying the ideas to other image processing tasks like image dehazing, deraining, etc. The globally guided feature transformation and relation distillation are general concepts not limited to image harmonization. The authors suggest exploring their benefits for other vision tasks.- Investigating multi-scale architecture and attention mechanisms. The current method uses a UNet backbone. The authors suggest designing a multi-scale network architecture to capture both global and local information. Attention can also help focus on important regions.- Studying adaptive compositing when the ground truth real image is not available. For real applications like compositing a foreground into a background image, there is no ground truth real image for supervision. The authors suggest designing an adaptive compositing framework to automatically adjust the foreground.- Extending to video harmonization. The current work focuses on image harmonization. The authors suggest extending the ideas to make video compositing more consistent and harmonious.In summary, the main future directions are: expanding the dataset, exploring new relation distillation methods, applying to other tasks, designing advanced network architectures, studying adaptive compositing, and extending to video harmonization. The paper provides a good basis and several promising research avenues can be further investigated.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a new deep learning method for image harmonization. The key contributions are:1) A globally guided feature transformation (GIFT) module that transforms the foreground features in each feature map using global guidance from the bottleneck feature. This provides global context to guide the foreground feature transformation. 2) A relation distillation method that transfers the foreground-background relation from real images to composite images. This provides intermediate supervision for the encoder features in the harmonization network.3) A new dataset called ccHarmony that simulates natural illumination variation by transferring foreground colors based on recorded illumination. This offers a new perspective for constructing harmonization datasets.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed globally guided feature transformation and relation distillation. The new ccHarmony dataset is shown to be useful for modeling natural illumination changes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method for image harmonization called GiftNet, which uses global feature guidance and foreground-background relation distillation. The key idea is to use the global image features extracted from the bottleneck of an encoder-decoder network to guide the transformation of foreground features. This helps adjust the foreground to match the background illumination. In addition, a reconstruction branch is used to reconstruct real images, and the relation between foreground and background features from this branch is distilled to the main harmonization branch. This provides useful supervision for the encoder features. The paper also contributes a new harmonization dataset called ccHarmony. It is constructed by transferring image foregrounds to different illumination conditions based on real images with color checker cards. This simulates natural illumination changes for the foregrounds. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for GiftNet. The global guidance and relation distillation are shown to be important components through ablation studies. Limitations include failure on images with artificial lighting. Overall, this paper presents an effective image harmonization method using global context and proposes a novel dataset generation process.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper proposes a deep learning based image harmonization method called GiftNet, which consists of two main components: 1) globally guided feature transformation (GIFT) module, which uses the global image feature to modulate the convolution kernels for transforming the foreground features to be compatible with the background; 2) relation distillation, which distills the foreground-background relation from a pretrained reconstruction branch to the harmonization branch, providing useful intermediate supervision. Specifically, the GIFT module takes the global feature extracted from the encoder bottleneck and predicts modulation scales to transform the foreground features in decoder blocks, making foreground compatible with background. The relation distillation calculates the similarity between averaged foreground feature and background features in the reconstruction branch, and distills this relation to the harmonization branch, ensuring that foreground matches background. Experiments on benchmark dataset iHarmony4 and a new contributed dataset ccHarmony demonstrate that both global guidance and relation distillation are effective, and GiftNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.
