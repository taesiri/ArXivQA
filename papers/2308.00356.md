# [Deep Image Harmonization with Globally Guided Feature Transformation and   Relation Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve deep image harmonization by better utilizing global image information and providing intermediate supervision? Specifically, the paper proposes two main contributions to address this:1) Globally guided feature transformation (GIFT). Previous methods have transformed foreground features using only local information within each feature map. This paper proposes to use a global feature vector extracted from the image to guide the transformation of foreground features in each local feature map. 2) Relation distillation. Most image harmonization methods only use final pixel-level supervision. This paper proposes an additional loss to provide intermediate supervision on encoder features, by distilling foreground-background relation from a pretrained reconstruction network to the harmonization network.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that utilizing global guidance for feature transformation and adding intermediate relation supervision can significantly improve deep image harmonization performance. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis, showing improved results over state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new method called GiftNet for image harmonization, which uses global feature guidance and relation distillation. 2. It introduces a new dataset called ccHarmony for image harmonization, which simulates natural illumination variation by transferring foreground colors based on images with color checkers. 3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GiftNet over previous methods on benchmark datasets. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of global guidance and relation distillation.4. The proposed ccHarmony dataset offers a new perspective for constructing image harmonization datasets to approximate natural illumination variation.In summary, the key innovations are the globally guided feature transformation, relation distillation, and the ccHarmony dataset construction method. Both the proposed method and dataset advance the image harmonization research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a deep image harmonization method that uses global image features to guide foreground feature transformation and distills foreground-background relation from real images to provide supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of image harmonization:- This paper proposes two main novelties - globally guided feature transformation using a GIFT module, and relation distillation between a reconstruction branch and harmonization branch. Both of these are relatively new ideas for image harmonization.- Most prior work has focused on designing separate processing pathways or attention modules for the foreground vs background. This paper takes a different approach by using global guidance and relation distillation.- The idea of using global features to guide local transformations has some similarity to the CDTNet paper, but CDTNet used global features for color transformations while this paper uses global features to modulate convolutional weights for feature transformations.- The use of knowledge distillation/relation distillation between two network branches is novel for image harmonization. Prior work has not explored distilling relations rather than just feature activations.- The proposed ccHarmony dataset provides a new way to generate training data for harmonization by simulating natural illumination variations, as opposed to other common approaches like compositing foregrounds onto random backgrounds.- Overall, the proposed techniques achieve state-of-the-art results on the iHarmony benchmark, demonstrating their effectiveness. The ideas are relatively unique compared to prior art.In summary, this paper introduces globally guided feature transformation and relation distillation which are new techniques for image harmonization, achieving improved results over prior work. The ccHarmony dataset also provides a novel training data generation process for this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions:- Using a larger dataset for training and evaluation. The authors note that the collected dataset in the paper is relatively small, so training on a larger dataset could help improve performance. They suggest collecting more images with color checkers to expand the ccHarmony dataset.- Exploring different ways to represent and distill foreground-background relation knowledge. The relation distillation method in the paper uses averaged foreground feature and similarity map. The authors suggest investigating other relation characterization and distillation methods. - Applying the ideas to other image processing tasks like image dehazing, deraining, etc. The globally guided feature transformation and relation distillation are general concepts not limited to image harmonization. The authors suggest exploring their benefits for other vision tasks.- Investigating multi-scale architecture and attention mechanisms. The current method uses a UNet backbone. The authors suggest designing a multi-scale network architecture to capture both global and local information. Attention can also help focus on important regions.- Studying adaptive compositing when the ground truth real image is not available. For real applications like compositing a foreground into a background image, there is no ground truth real image for supervision. The authors suggest designing an adaptive compositing framework to automatically adjust the foreground.- Extending to video harmonization. The current work focuses on image harmonization. The authors suggest extending the ideas to make video compositing more consistent and harmonious.In summary, the main future directions are: expanding the dataset, exploring new relation distillation methods, applying to other tasks, designing advanced network architectures, studying adaptive compositing, and extending to video harmonization. The paper provides a good basis and several promising research avenues can be further investigated.
