# [Discretionary Trees: Understanding Street-Level Bureaucracy via Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to understand the decision-making of street-level bureaucrats, specifically homelessness caseworkers, who are tasked with allocating limited housing resources to homeless individuals and families. Caseworkers are granted significant discretion in applying agency policies. The authors investigate three main questions: 
1) Can caseworker decisions be captured by simple decision rules/heuristics to reduce cognitive load? 
2) When decisions are not driven by simple rules ("discretionary decisions"), are caseworkers still consistent in their judgments?  
3) When discretion is applied, what is the cost/benefit trade-off?

Proposed Solution:
The authors utilize a rich dataset of homelessness interventions assigned in St. Louis before 2014, when no explicit formula was used for prioritization. Along with the interventions, the data contains demographic and other features of households. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to understand the predictability of caseworker decisions and the nature of their discretion.

Main Contributions:
- Simple decision tree rules can capture some but not all caseworker decisions, achieving AUCs of 0.76 and 0.87 for predicting Emergency Shelter and Transitional Housing assignments respectively. This aligns with theory that street-level bureaucrats use simple heuristics.
- Gradient boosted trees achieve AUCs of 0.95 and 0.94 for the same tasks, showing high consistency in more complex caseworker decisions. This demonstrates procedural justice in judgments.  
- Caseworkers apply discretion (decisions not captured by simple rules) only to less vulnerable households typically. However, discretion leading to more intensive interventions has significantly higher marginal benefit while less intensive discretionary decisions see no significant loss. This nuanced application of discretion surprisingly aligns with quantitative machine learning recommendations, even though caseworkers would not have had access to such metrics.

In summary, the paper leverages AI techniques to shed light on important questions regarding consistency, bias, and sophistication in human decision-making by street-level bureaucrats. The findings can inform appropriate development of algorithmic decision support tools as well as transparency initiatives surrounding resource allocation policies.
