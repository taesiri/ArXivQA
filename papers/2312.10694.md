# [Discretionary Trees: Understanding Street-Level Bureaucracy via Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to understand the decision-making of street-level bureaucrats, specifically homelessness caseworkers, who are tasked with allocating limited housing resources to homeless individuals and families. Caseworkers are granted significant discretion in applying agency policies. The authors investigate three main questions: 
1) Can caseworker decisions be captured by simple decision rules/heuristics to reduce cognitive load? 
2) When decisions are not driven by simple rules ("discretionary decisions"), are caseworkers still consistent in their judgments?  
3) When discretion is applied, what is the cost/benefit trade-off?

Proposed Solution:
The authors utilize a rich dataset of homelessness interventions assigned in St. Louis before 2014, when no explicit formula was used for prioritization. Along with the interventions, the data contains demographic and other features of households. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to understand the predictability of caseworker decisions and the nature of their discretion.

Main Contributions:
- Simple decision tree rules can capture some but not all caseworker decisions, achieving AUCs of 0.76 and 0.87 for predicting Emergency Shelter and Transitional Housing assignments respectively. This aligns with theory that street-level bureaucrats use simple heuristics.
- Gradient boosted trees achieve AUCs of 0.95 and 0.94 for the same tasks, showing high consistency in more complex caseworker decisions. This demonstrates procedural justice in judgments.  
- Caseworkers apply discretion (decisions not captured by simple rules) only to less vulnerable households typically. However, discretion leading to more intensive interventions has significantly higher marginal benefit while less intensive discretionary decisions see no significant loss. This nuanced application of discretion surprisingly aligns with quantitative machine learning recommendations, even though caseworkers would not have had access to such metrics.

In summary, the paper leverages AI techniques to shed light on important questions regarding consistency, bias, and sophistication in human decision-making by street-level bureaucrats. The findings can inform appropriate development of algorithmic decision support tools as well as transparency initiatives surrounding resource allocation policies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper uses machine learning techniques to analyze decisions made by homelessness caseworkers, finding that they employ simple heuristics in many cases while still demonstrating consistency in applying discretion, particularly to less vulnerable applicants in a way that appears to improve outcomes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is using machine learning techniques to understand and analyze the decision-making of street-level bureaucrats (homelessness caseworkers) in assigning interventions to households experiencing homelessness. 

Specifically, the paper:

1) Shows that a significant portion of caseworker decisions can be captured by simple decision rules/heuristics, supporting the theory that they use such methods to reduce cognitive load. 

2) Demonstrates that even when not using simple rules, caseworker decisions are highly consistent overall, addressing concerns about procedural justice.

3) Analyzes the application of caseworker discretion, finding that they mainly apply it to less vulnerable households. However, the discretionary decisions actually improve outcomes, suggesting sophisticated judgment by the caseworkers.

So in summary, the paper leverages AI/ML to shed new light on human decision-making in a complex street-level bureaucracy, revealing the use of simple heuristics as well as nuanced discretionary behavior that aligns with good outcomes. This represents a novel contribution at the intersection of AI and public administration.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Street-level bureaucracy
- Homelessness
- Resource allocation
- Caseworkers
- Discretion
- Decision rules
- Machine learning
- Predictability
- Consistency 
- Vulnerability
- Outcomes
- Marginal benefit
- Emergency shelter
- Transitional housing

The paper applies machine learning techniques to understand and predict the decision-making of caseworkers in allocating homeless services. It looks at the predictability and consistency of these decisions, as well as the role of caseworker discretion, especially in relation to household vulnerability and expected outcomes/marginal benefits. The interventions focused on are emergency shelter and transitional housing. Overall, the goal is to shed light on street-level bureaucracy in the context of homelessness service delivery.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper operationalizes the notion of "simple decision rules" using short decision trees. What are some potential limitations of this approach? Could there be simple rules that are not easily captured by decision trees? 

2. When analyzing discretionary assignments, the paper focuses on two subgroups where the actual intervention differed from the prediction. What insights could be gained by taking a more comprehensive look at all mismatches between prediction and actual assignment?

3. For measuring potential outcomes, the paper uses estimates of the probability of returning to homelessness. What other outcome measures could also provide useful insights into the impacts of discretionary assignments?

4. The method of creating a Vulnerability Score (VS) seeks to replicate the VI-SPDAT as closely as possible. However, the VI-SPDAT has known biases. How might an alternative vulnerability measure avoid perpetuating those same biases?  

5. The analysis of marginal benefit relies on having good estimates of the counterfactual outcomes under different interventions. How sensitive are the results to the accuracy of those counterfactual estimates?

6. When analyzing the EStoTH and THtoES subgroups, the paper focuses on differences in mean vulnerability scores and marginal benefits. What insights could be gained by looking at the full distributions instead of just the means?

7. For the nonparametric testing, the paper uses 1000 random control groups to generate the distribution. What criteria should be used to determine an appropriate number of control groups?

8. What data would need to be collected to better understand the specific reasons behind individual discretionary decisions made by caseworkers? 

9. How well would the predictability results for short and complex decision trees generalize to other street-level bureaucracy contexts besides homelessness services?

10. The paper suggests caseworkers are adept at optimizing outcomes through their discretionary assignments. What evidence would be needed to determine if they are actually optimizing vs. satisficing?
