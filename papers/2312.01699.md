# [Rethinking Urban Mobility Prediction: A Super-Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01699)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel architecture called Super-Multivariate Urban Mobility Transformer (SUMformer) for long-term prediction of grid-based urban mobility data. The key idea is to view the data as a complex multivariate time series rather than a video, allowing better modeling of temporal dynamics, cross-variable correlations, and frequency insights. Specifically, the data is converted into a super-multivariate time series with each grid cell's time series treated independently. SUMformer then applies temporal, inter-series, and frequency (TVF) blocks in a hierarchical framework enabled by temporal patch merging to capture multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations. The temporal block models dynamics within each time series, while the inter-series block efficiently computes cross-variable attention to extract correlations between series. Additionally, a frequency block applies Fourier transforms for preprocessing in the frequency domain. Experiments on three real-world urban mobility datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of the proposed super-multivariate perspective over conventional video-based approaches. Key innovations include the shift towards explicit multivariate time series modeling tailored for mobility data, efficient cross-variable correlation capture scaling linearly in complexity, and emphasis on periodic urban patterns through frequency analysis.
