# [Beyond Natural Language: LLMs Leveraging Alternative Formats for   Enhanced Reasoning and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Natural language (NL) has long been the default format for reasoning and communication by both humans and large language models (LLMs). However, the optimality of NL for LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication has not been thoroughly examined.

- This paper investigates whether allowing LLMs to autonomously choose alternative non-NL formats before reasoning or communicating leads to performance improvements.

Method: 
- The authors propose a simple yet effective prompting mechanism called "AutoForm" where LLMs are instructed to explore and select the most suitable format for the task. 

- For single-LLM reasoning tasks, AutoForm is added to existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. 

- For multi-agent communication tasks, AutoForm instructs agents to use non-NL formats.

Results:
- For single-LLM reasoning, AutoForm leads to average performance improvements of 3.3-5.7% across different models and datasets. The chosen formats include lists, logical expressions and markdown tables.

- For multi-agent communication, AutoForm reduces token usage by up to 72.7% without sacrificing effectiveness. The communication formats mirror structured agent communication languages.

Analysis: 
- Comprehensive analysis reveals LLMs can generalize a reasoning format from limited inputs and transfer it between models.

- Communication formats exhibit clarity, brevity and structure, aligning with formal agent communication languages while enhancing efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates LLMs can leverage non-NL formats to improve reasoning and communication efficiency with comparable or better effectiveness.

- AutoForm provides a simple yet effective way for LLMs to explore alternative formats suitable for the task.

- Reveals chosen formats align with established reasoning and communication conventions.

In summary, this paper challenges the default use of NL in LLMs by allowing them to decide better-suited formats, yielding performance improvements in reasoning and significant efficiency gains in communication.
