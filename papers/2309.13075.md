# [SCREWS: A Modular Framework for Reasoning with Revisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13075)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:How can a modular framework for reasoning with revisions, composed of sampling, conditional resampling, and selection modules, enable improved reasoning chains from large language models?The key ideas seem to be:- Sampling methods like chain of thought and subquestion decomposition can produce initial reasoning chains. - Conditional resampling based on model feedback or tools can help revise the initial samples, but may sometimes introduce new errors.- A selection module is important to choose between original and revised reasoning chains.- Heterogeneous sampling and resampling strategies are useful, rather than just iterative refinement with the same method. - Different reasoning tasks may benefit from different configurations of the modules.- Putting these together in a flexible modular framework allows testing and comparison of various strategies for generating, revising, and selecting reasoning chains.The overarching hypothesis appears to be that this modular framework will enable improved reasoning performance compared to less flexible approaches, by supporting exploration of heterogeneous strategies and selection to avoid harmful revisions. The paper aims to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework on diverse reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a modular framework called Screws for reasoning with revisions from large language models (LLMs). The framework consists of three key modules - Sampling, Conditional Resampling, and Selection. 2. It demonstrates how several existing approaches like self-refinement, CoT, LLMs Know Mostly, etc. can be seen as instantiations of the Screws framework by choosing different submodules. This provides a unified way to view prior work.3. It shows through experiments on arithmetic, QA, and code debugging tasks that changing methods between Sampling and Resampling helps. Selection is also useful to avoid errors introduced during resampling. 4. The paper analyzes tradeoffs between accuracy and cost for different instantiations of Screws. It finds simple methods like CoT can beat more complex ones like subquestion decomposition.5. The modular nature of Screws allows exploring many new strategies like using tools during resampling. The paper shows the benefit of using facts during resampling on a QA dataset.6. Experiments with GPT-4 show the framework also works with larger models. Heterogeneous resampling and selection both remain useful.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Screws, a modular framework that unifies and expands prior work on iterative reasoning and revision with LLMs. The paper empirically demonstrates the benefits of heterogeneity and selection within this framework.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper presents a new modular framework called SCREWS for iterative reasoning with large language models. This builds on prior work on self-refinement and iterative improvement methods, but unifies them under one framework and allows mixing and matching different components. The modular nature is a novel contribution compared to prior work.- The paper evaluates the framework on a diverse set of reasoning tasks - arithmetic, multi-hop QA, and code debugging. Showing benefits across these different tasks helps demonstrate the general applicability of the framework. Many prior works have focused evaluation on a single task or dataset. - The paper highlights the importance of selection between original and revised predictions, showing it helps avoid erroneous modifications. Prior iterative refinement work often focuses just on generating improved outputs without considering rolling back changes. The paper shows benefits to selecting between options.- The paper demonstrates advantages from using heterogeneous reasoning strategies for sampling and resampling. For example, switching from chain of thought to subquestion decomposition between the two steps improves results. Many prior refinement approaches use the same method for initial and revised predictions. - The paper uses large models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for evaluation. Many recent advances have been enabled by scaling up model size, so building methods that improve these large models is an important contribution.- Overall the paper moves beyond a single method to a flexible framework that combines strengths of prior work, and systematically evaluates different configurations. The gains over baseline methods help validate the benefits of this modular framework for iterative reasoning. The approach seems promising for continued research on how to best leverage and combine large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring additional possible instantiations for each module in the framework, such as using tools like web search or memory cache for the Sampling module, fine-tuned models for Conditional Resampling, and human- or oracle-based selection.- Automating the process of selecting the optimal configuration of modules per task, such as through exhaustive search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, or reinforcement learning.- Fine-tuning the modules themselves to directly optimize end-to-end performance on downstream tasks. - Adding new modules like Critiquing before Resampling/Selection or generalizing Selection to Combination.- Optimizing for both accuracy and computational cost, such as through methods proposed in FrugalGPT.- Iterating through more cycles of Conditional Resampling and Selection to further refine the outputs.- Evaluating the framework on a wider range of reasoning tasks.- Using the framework with larger LLMs to scale up performance.- Developing better calibrated selection modules to identify harmful revisions.So in summary, the main future directions are enhancing the existing modules, adding new complementary modules, automating configuration, scaling up the LLMs used, expanding the task coverage, and iterating for more refinement. The modular nature of the framework allows flexibility to explore many possible extensions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents \our, a modular framework for reasoning with revisions using large language models (LLMs). It consists of three main modules - Sampling, Conditional Resampling, and Selection. Sampling generates an initial output, Conditional Resampling decides whether to revise the output and generates a new one if needed, and Selection chooses the best output between the original and revised ones. The modules are flexible and can be instantiated in various ways, unifying several prior approaches. The paper shows that heterogeneous resampling using different strategies than original sampling helps improve reasoning. Selection is important to avoid errors introduced during resampling. The framework is evaluated on arithmetic, question answering, and code debugging tasks using ChatGPT and GPT-4, outperforming vanilla sampling and resampling baselines. Key findings are the usefulness of selection, heterogeneous resampling, external knowledge for resampling, and lack of a uniformly best module instantiation. The modular nature allows exploring different strategies and extending to other tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces SCREWS, a modular framework for reasoning with revisions using large language models (LLMs). The framework consists of three main modules - Sampling, Conditional Resampling, and Selection. The Sampling module generates an initial answer. The Conditional Resampling module decides whether to revise the initial answer and generates a new one if needed. Finally, the Selection module chooses between the original and revised answers. The paper demonstrates the benefits of the modular framework through experiments on arithmetic, question answering, and code debugging tasks. Key findings are: 1) Selection is important to avoid incorrect revisions, 2) Using different reasoning methods for Sampling vs. Resampling improves accuracy, 3) Missing knowledge hurts Resampling so tools are useful, and 4) No single strategy is best across all tasks. The framework not only unifies prior work but also enables new strategies. Experiments with ChatGPT and GPT-4 show gains of 10-15% over vanilla sampling and resampling. The paper concludes that heterogeneous reasoning and selection are important capabilities for iterative reasoning with modern LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents \our, a modular framework for reasoning with revisions from large language models (LLMs). The framework consists of three main modules - Sampling, Conditional Resampling, and Selection. The Sampling module generates an initial output using methods like chain of thought or subquestion decomposition. The Conditional Resampling module decides whether to revise the initial output using the same or a different reasoning method, optionally using external tools. Finally, the Selection module chooses between the original and revised outputs using rules or an LLM. The modular nature of the framework allows exploring different combinations of reasoning strategies. The authors evaluate combinations of the modules on arithmetic, question answering, and code debugging tasks using ChatGPT and GPT-4. Key findings are the importance of selection to avoid incorrect revisions, using heterogeneous reasoning methods for sampling and resampling, and the value of tools during resampling when models lack external knowledge. The results demonstrate the flexibility of the framework in improving reasoning through iterative refinement.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the abstract, introduction, and conclusion, this paper appears to be addressing the following main problem:How to enable iterative refinement of outputs from large language models (LLMs) in a flexible way that allows exploring different strategies for generating, revising, and selecting among candidate outputs.Specifically, the paper discusses how LLMs can often improve their accuracy by iteratively refining their outputs based on feedback. However, it notes two limitations of current refinement approaches:1) Revisions can sometimes introduce new errors, so it would be better to have a way to roll back to a previous output. 2) Refinements typically rely on the same reasoning method that produced the initial output. But using different strategies could potentially correct more errors.To address these issues, the paper introduces a modular framework called SCREWS that allows flexibly combining different methods for sampling initial outputs, conditionally resampling/revising outputs, and selecting among candidates. The core contribution is providing a way to explore and identify improved reasoning strategies by mixing and matching different modules in this framework. Experiments demonstrate benefits such as the usefulness of heterogeneous resampling strategies and model-based selection between original and revised outputs.In summary, the main problem addressed is how to move beyond monolithic refinement strategies in LLMs to a more flexible framework for combining and selecting among diverse reasoning chains. The SCREWS framework allows explicitly exploring this space of strategies.
