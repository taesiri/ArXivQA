# [Are you a robot? Detecting Autonomous Vehicles from Behavior Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- We are in a transition phase with a mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles on roads. This causes safety issues that must be addressed. 
- There is a need to automatically detect and profile autonomous vehicles, without requiring active notification from the vehicles themselves. This can help improve safety by identifying vehicles with inconsistent behaviors.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a framework that monitors vehicles using camera images and state information (e.g. position, speed) to determine if a target vehicle is autonomous or human-driven. 
- The framework uses a dataset collected in the CARLA simulator with an autonomous driving agent and human drivers using a steering wheel. 
- Machine learning models like Random Forest and LSTM are trained on temporal series of images and numeric state features of target vehicles.

Main Contributions:
- Generation of a novel dataset (NexusStreets) combining autonomous and human driving scenes.
- Benchmark results for various ML models on the autonomous vehicle detection task. 
- Formulation of the problem as supervised classification of multivariate time series data.
- Demonstration that it is possible to discriminate behaviors with ~80% accuracy from videos alone and ~93% accuracy when target vehicle state data is available.
- Public release of the dataset to the research community.

In summary, the key innovation is an overarching framework leveraging computer vision and state data to automatically detect autonomous vehicles based on their behavior, without needing explicit notifications from the vehicles. This can enable profiling of autonomous cars to improve safety during the transition period with mixed traffic.
