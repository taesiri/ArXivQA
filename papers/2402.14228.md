# [COPR: Continual Human Preference Learning via Optimal Policy   Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is commonly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but human preferences evolve over time. 
- Continually learning new preferences while retaining past ones is challenging due to the complexity of the RLHF pipeline and risks of catastrophic forgetting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Continual Optimal Policy Regularization (COPR) to continually align LLMs with evolving human preferences. 
- COPR formulates the problem based on optimal policy theory and uses a sampling distribution as both a demonstration and regularization constraint.  
- It employs a model-free reward function and Lagrangian duality to balance learning new vs old preferences.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes COPR, the first method for continually aligning LLMs with changing human preferences.
- Introduces a model-free reward function that simplifies reward modeling.
- Leverages sampling distribution and optimal policies for regularization to prevent forgetting.  
- Provides theoretical analysis on achieving optimal alignment under limited sampling.
- Proposes the first benchmark for evaluating continual alignment methods.
- Experiments show COPR outperforms baselines on proposed benchmark and is robust across settings.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards continually and safely aligning LLMs as human preferences evolve over time. The COPR method is flexible, effective, and poses promising advancements for deployment.
