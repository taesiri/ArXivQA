# [VideoDirectorGPT: Consistent Multi-scene Video Generation via LLM-Guided   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15091)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: Can we leverage the knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs) for temporally consistent long video generation? 

Specifically, the authors propose a novel framework called VideoDirectorGPT that uses LLMs for video content planning and grounded video generation in order to generate consistent multi-scene videos from text prompts. The key hypotheses are:

1) Employing an LLM as a "video planner" to generate structured video plans (including scene descriptions, entities, layouts, etc.) can guide the downstream video generation process for accurate and controllable long video generation.

2) Introducing a "grounded video generation module" that brings together image/text-based layout control and entity-level temporal consistency can render videos with better layout and movement control as well as cross-scene consistency compared to existing text-to-video models.

3) Training the video generation module in a parameter and data-efficient manner using only image-level annotations (bypassing expensive video-level supervision) can still equip it with multi-scene consistency without compromising visual quality.

Through experiments on both single-scene and multi-scene video generation, the authors demonstrate that their proposed framework substantially improves layout and movement control, generates consistent multi-scene videos, while maintaining competitive performance on open-domain text-to-video generation.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating the planning ability of LLMs with a grounded video generation module can enable consistent and controllable long video generation from text prompts. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel two-stage framework for consistent multi-scene video generation from text descriptions. The key highlights are:

- A new framework called VideoDirectorGPT that leverages large language models (LLMs) for video content planning and grounded video generation. 

- In the first stage, the LLM acts as a "video planner" to generate a detailed "video plan" that includes scene descriptions, entities, layouts, and consistency groupings to guide the video generation process.

- In the second stage, a novel grounded video generation module called Layout2Vid is introduced. It can generate videos with layout and cross-scene consistency control based on the video plan from the first stage.

- Layout2Vid brings spatial layout control and temporal consistency into an off-the-shelf text-to-video model via efficient training with only image-level annotations.

- Experiments show the framework substantially improves layout and movement control in single- and multi-scene videos, while maintaining strong performance on open-domain video generation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new two-stage approach that strategically uses the planning ability of LLMs to guide grounded video generation, enabling control over spatial layouts and temporal consistency across multiple scenes in text-to-video generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation that uses a large language model to generate a structured video plan for guiding a text-to-video model to create videos with accurate layout control and consistency across scenes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on text-to-video generation:

- It introduces a new two-stage framework (VideoDirectorGPT) that combines large language model planning with a trained video generation module. Most prior work has focused on end-to-end models trained directly on text-video pairs. Using the LLM planning allows this approach to generate more structured, consistent multi-scene videos.

- The proposed video generation module (Layout2Vid) brings in layout/bounding box control and cross-scene consistency without needing expensive video-level supervision - it is trained on image data. Other recent works require full video data for training.

- Experiments demonstrate this method has strong performance on layout and object control, generating consistent multi-scene videos, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art for open domain single scene video generation. Prior work focused mainly on short single scene videos.

- The framework can take variable input modalities - text only or text+images - to control object appearances across scenes. Most models only take text input. 

- Limitations are similar to other video generation works - potential for misuse, cost of LLM, and reliance on ModelScopeT2V foundation.

Overall, the key novelty is the combined planning via LLM with a video generation module trained for layout/consistency control on images. This helps enable more structured, consistent multi-scene video generation compared to prior works that focused on single scene snippets. The experiments demonstrate promising improvements in layout, consistency, and flexibility of this approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key future research directions the authors suggest:

- Developing better video planning methods, such as exploring different prompting techniques or architectures for the video planner LLM. The authors note there is room for improvement in the accuracy of the video plans generated by the LLM.

- Improving the video generation module by exploring different network architectures or training techniques. The authors point out that a stronger video generation backbone could help translate the video plans into even more accurate videos.

- Evaluating the framework on a broader range of tasks and video types, beyond the current experiments on single-scene skill-based prompts, multi-scene consistency, and open-domain videos. 

- Scaling up the framework to generate longer and higher-resolution videos. The current method is limited to videos of 16 frames at 256x256 resolution.

- Reducing the computational cost of using large LLMs for video planning. The authors suggest model quantization or distillation could help with this.

- Addressing potential negative societal impacts, such as creation of false information. The authors recommend using caution when deploying video generation models in real-world applications.

- Overcoming the language limitations of the current English-only model by expanding to more languages.

In summary, the key directions are improving the video planning and generation components, broadening the scope of tasks and videos evaluated, scaling to longer/higher-res videos, reducing LLM inference costs, ensuring positive societal impact, and supporting more languages.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VideoDirectorGPT, a novel two-stage framework for consistent multi-scene video generation from text prompts. In the first stage, GPT-4 is used as a video planner to generate a "video plan" that provides an overall plot for the video with scene descriptions, entities, layouts, and consistency groupings. In the second stage, a grounded video generation module called Layout2Vid is introduced to render the actual videos following the video plan. Layout2Vid brings together image/text-based layout control and entity-level temporal consistency while being trained efficiently on only image annotations. Experiments demonstrate that VideoDirectorGPT can accurately control object layouts and movements in single-scene videos and generate visually consistent multi-scene videos. The framework also allows flexible use of text or images to represent entities. Overall, the paper introduces a novel approach to leverage the planning capabilities of large language models like GPT-4 for consistent long video generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation from text prompts. The key idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate structured "video plans" that guide the downstream video generation process. 

The framework has two main stages. First, the LLM acts as a "video planner" to expand a text prompt into a detailed video plan. This plan consists of multi-scene descriptions, entities (objects) and their bounding boxes, backgrounds, and consistency groupings indicating which entities should look the same across scenes. Second, a "video generator" module called Layout2Vid renders multi-scene videos based on the video plan. Layout2Vid builds on an existing text-to-video model called ModelScopeT2V but adds the ability to control spatial layout and maintain object consistency across scenes. Experiments demonstrate improved layout and movement control over baselines in single-scene videos, and the ability to generate multi-scene videos with temporally consistent entities in a parameter-efficient way without expensive video-level supervision. The framework shows promise for controllable, consistent long video generation.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel two-stage framework for consistent multi-scene video generation from text prompts. In the first stage, they use a large language model (LLM) as a video planner to generate a structured "video plan" that includes multi-scene descriptions, entities with layouts, backgrounds, and consistency groupings. Specifically, they prompt the LLM with examples to expand a text prompt into detailed scene descriptions, entities, layouts, and groupings that will guide video generation. In the second stage, they introduce a novel video generation module called Layout2Vid that can render videos following the plan from the LLM. Layout2Vid builds on top of an existing text-to-video model by adding spatial layout control through a small set of trainable parameters in the attention module. It is trained on image-level bounding box annotations to control object layouts without needing full video supervision. The consistency groupings from the video plan allow it to preserve object identities across scenes. In summary, the main novelty is using the knowledge captured in LLMs to plan detailed video content structure, and then leveraging this plan to achieve controlled and consistent video generation through a video module trained on weakly labeled image data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a new framework for generating long, multi-scene videos from text descriptions. The key problem it aims to address is how to leverage large language models (LLMs) to plan and guide the generation of consistent, controllable multi-scene videos from text. 

The current state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation focuses on short, single scene videos. Generating longer, multi-scene videos with consistency across scenes remains challenging. The authors propose using LLMs in a two-stage framework: first to generate a structured "video plan" to guide the video generation, and second to generate the actual video using the plan.

Specifically, the video plan includes multi-scene descriptions, entities/backgrounds, layouts, and consistency groupings. This guides a "grounded video generation module" to render a video with controlled layouts and consistent entities across scenes. 

Overall, the key research question is how to effectively utilize LLMs for planning and controlling the generation of multi-scene videos. The paper aims to demonstrate that explicitly planning the content and structure of videos with LLMs can enable more consistent and controllable long video generation compared to existing text-to-video models.
