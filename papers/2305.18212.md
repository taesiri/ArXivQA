# [Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference: A New   Challenge and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18212)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goal is to introduce a new dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) to facilitate research on building conversational agents that can handle subjective preferences and make shopping recommendations in multimodal scenarios like physical stores. Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of existing multimodal dialog datasets which lack diverse expressions of user subjective preferences and recommendation strategies. The key hypotheses are:1) Subjective preferences are important in real-life shopping scenarios but are not well represented in existing dialog datasets.2) Recommendation strategies like clarifying subjective preferences, narrowing down candidate items, and referring to regions are crucial for salesperson agents but not depicted in current data. 3) A high-quality dataset incorporating subjective preferences and diverse recommendation acts proposed by sales experts will promote research on more capable multimodal shopping agents.To test these hypotheses, the authors introduce the SURE dataset which contains complex store scenes and 12K dialogs with subjective preferences annotated. The dialogs are generated via simulation and crowdsourcing to ensure both quality and diversity. Three benchmark tasks are proposed on SURE to evaluate agent capabilities on subjective preference understanding and multimodal recommendation. A baseline model is provided as a starting point.In summary, the central research goal is to facilitate building multimodal shopping agents that can handle subjective preferences and complex recommendation strategies, by introducing the SURE dataset and associated tasks and models. The key hypotheses focus on the importance of subjective preferences and recommendation acts in this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new multimodal dialog dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) for studying subjective preference understanding and item recommendation in complex store scenes. The key aspects are:- They collected a large-scale multimodal dialog dataset with 12K goal-oriented shopping dialogs between salesperson and customer. The dialogs contain rich subjective preferences expressed by customers. - The data was built in two phases - dialog flow simulation and manual paraphrasing - to ensure both dialog quality and language diversity.- The dataset contains annotations of subjective preferences, salesperson dialog acts, referred regions, etc. proposed by experienced sales experts. This provides rich resources for training and evaluating multimodal dialog agents.- They designed 3 tasks on subjective preference disambiguation, referred region understanding and multimodal recommendation to benchmark progress in this area. A baseline model MRA was proposed and analyzed.- The introduced dataset addresses the limitations of existing multimodal dialog datasets by including diverse subjective preferences and multimodal recommendation acts, which are common in real-world shopping scenarios but not well depicted previously.In summary, the key contribution is creating a new challenging multimodal dialog dataset focusing on subjective preferences and recommendation acts, along with benchmark tasks, to facilitate research on building intelligent multimodal recommendation agents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of multimodal dialog systems:- This paper introduces a new multimodal dialog dataset called SURE (Subjective Preference Recommendation Dialogs) which focuses on subjective preferences and recommendations during shopping conversations. Other multimodal dialog datasets like SIMMC and MMD do not have this focus on subjective preferences and recommendations. So SURE provides a new direction and challenge.- The SURE dataset is collected in a rigorous two-phase process to ensure dialog quality and diversity. Other datasets like SIMMC and MMD used less rigorous data collection methods. The two-phase approach here should result in higher quality data.- The SURE dataset contains rich annotations of subjective preferences, salesperson dialog acts, and recommendations. Other datasets have less detailed annotations. These annotations enable training and evaluating more complex dialog models.- Three new benchmark tasks are proposed with SURE to evaluate multimodal understanding, subjective preference disambiguation, and dialog policy learning. Other datasets like SIMMC focused more narrowly on co-reference resolution and state tracking. So SURE provides a wider range of evaluation capabilities.- A strong baseline model MRA is provided for the SURE benchmark tasks. The challenges and limitations of this model are analyzed. Other datasets either lack baseline models or provide only simple baselines. The analysis here gives clear direction for advancing the state-of-the-art.In summary, the SURE dataset and benchmarks significantly expand the scope and capability of multimodal dialog research compared to prior work. The focus on subjective preferences and recommendations in complex scenes is an important new direction with real-world applicability. The rigorous data collection, rich annotations, new tasks, and strong baselines provide a solid foundation for future research. This represents a valuable step forward for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing modules or proposing multimodal pretraining tasks to improve models' understanding of subjective preferences, perception of referred regions, and ability to take suitable dialog acts. The authors note that their baseline model struggles with accurately understanding subjective preferences and referred regions, which hurts its ability to take appropriate acts and make correct recommendations. New model components or pretraining objectives could help address these weaknesses.- Exploring how to build user simulators that can express more diverse and naturalistic subjective preferences, rather than just attribute concepts. This could further enrich dialog training data.- Evaluating model capabilities on multilingual data. The current dataset is only in English, but expanding to other languages could make the tasks more realistic.- Studying how subjective preferences vary across individuals and cultures. The current annotation process may bias subjective preferences, so analyzing real variations could improve generalization. - Investigating reinforcement learning and dialog policy optimization techniques to improve recommendation strategies. The authors suggest this could help balance dialog efficiency and customer experience.- Enabling controllable generation of recommendations and dialogs, allowing users to guide attribute priorities and dialog styles.- Exploring evaluation metrics beyond item recommendation accuracy, such as diversity, explainability, and user satisfaction.In summary, the key directions are improving multimodal understanding of preferences, expanding language and dialog diversity, studying personalized and controllable generation, and developing more comprehensive evaluation metrics. Advancing in these areas could lead to more capable and realistic multimodal recommendation agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces a new dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) for building conversational agents that can make clothing and furniture recommendations based on subjective customer preferences. The dataset contains 12,000 dialogs between a customer and salesperson in simulated store environments with visual scenes. The dialogs involve the customer expressing subjective preferences like "color that makes me feel calm" which the salesperson must map to actual attribute values like "blue" to make an appropriate recommendation. The data was collected in two phases - first dialog flows were generated through simulator interactions, then humans rewrote the dialogs to introduce greater language diversity. The paper proposes three benchmark tasks on the dataset to evaluate an agent's ability to understand subjective preferences, understand referred regions, and provide multimodal recommendations. They also provide a baseline multimodal recommender model and analyze its limitations, proposing future research directions like better understanding subjective language and perceiving spatial references. The new dataset and tasks aim to advance research on conversational agents for visual recommendation domains like shopping.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new multimodal dialog dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) containing 12K goal-oriented shopping dialogs between customers and salespersons in complex store scenes. The dialogs involve customers expressing subjective preferences (e.g. "color that makes me feel calm") which salespersons must map to objective attributes to recommend items. To build the high-quality and diverse dataset, dialog flows are first generated through simulator interaction then rewritten by humans. The paper proposes three benchmark tasks on SURE to evaluate multimodal conversational recommendation agents: Subjective Preference Disambiguation, Referred Region Understanding, and Multimodal Recommendation. These tasks test the agent's ability to understand subjective preferences, perceive spatial references, and conduct natural dialog to recommend items. A baseline multimodal model called MRA is presented and analyzed, showing the challenges involved. Overall, the SURE dataset and tasks aim to advance research towards more capable multimodal conversational recommendation agents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) for building multimodal dialog agents that can understand subjective preferences and make recommendations in complex store scenes. The dataset contains 12K dialogs collected in a two phase process - first simulating dialog flows between a customer simulator and salesperson simulator based on surveys of sales experts, then having crowdworkers paraphrase the dialogs to add subjective preferences and natural language variations. The dataset contains rich annotations of subjective preferences, dialog acts, and multimodal context. Based on the SURE dataset, the authors propose three benchmark tasks to evaluate multimodal dialog agents: Subjective Preference Disambiguation, Referred Region Understanding, and Multimodal Recommendation. They provide a baseline model called MRA that utilizes a state-of-the-art multimodal Transformer architecture. The results show limitations of the current model on the new challenges introduced in SURE, providing direction for future research.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- Existing multimodal task-oriented dialog datasets like SIMMC fail to capture the diverse expressions of user subjective preferences and salesperson recommendation acts that occur in real-life shopping scenarios. - The paper introduces a new multimodal dialog dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) to address this limitation. SURE contains 12K dialogs with complex store scenes and rich annotations of subjective preferences and salesperson acts.- The data is collected in two phases - first simulating dialog flows between customer and salesperson bots, then having humans rewrite the dialogs to add subjective preferences and natural language.- Three tasks are proposed on SURE to evaluate multimodal recommendation agents - Subjective Preference Disambiguation, Referred Region Understanding, and Multimodal Recommendation (with subtasks).- A baseline multimodal transformer model called MRA is proposed and evaluated on SURE. The poor performance highlights challenges like understanding subjective preferences from dialog history and visual context.In summary, the key problem is that existing dialog datasets lack the diversity of subjective language and recommendation strategies seen in real shopping scenarios. The paper introduces the SURE dataset to facilitate research on building multimodal recommendation agents that can understand subjective preferences and perform realistic recommendation dialogs.
