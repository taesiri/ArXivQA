# Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference: A New   Challenge and Benchmark

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goal is to introduce a new dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) to facilitate research on building conversational agents that can handle subjective preferences and make shopping recommendations in multimodal scenarios like physical stores. Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of existing multimodal dialog datasets which lack diverse expressions of user subjective preferences and recommendation strategies. The key hypotheses are:1) Subjective preferences are important in real-life shopping scenarios but are not well represented in existing dialog datasets.2) Recommendation strategies like clarifying subjective preferences, narrowing down candidate items, and referring to regions are crucial for salesperson agents but not depicted in current data. 3) A high-quality dataset incorporating subjective preferences and diverse recommendation acts proposed by sales experts will promote research on more capable multimodal shopping agents.To test these hypotheses, the authors introduce the SURE dataset which contains complex store scenes and 12K dialogs with subjective preferences annotated. The dialogs are generated via simulation and crowdsourcing to ensure both quality and diversity. Three benchmark tasks are proposed on SURE to evaluate agent capabilities on subjective preference understanding and multimodal recommendation. A baseline model is provided as a starting point.In summary, the central research goal is to facilitate building multimodal shopping agents that can handle subjective preferences and complex recommendation strategies, by introducing the SURE dataset and associated tasks and models. The key hypotheses focus on the importance of subjective preferences and recommendation acts in this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new multimodal dialog dataset called SURE (Multimodal Recommendation Dialog with Subjective Preference) for studying subjective preference understanding and item recommendation in complex store scenes. The key aspects are:- They collected a large-scale multimodal dialog dataset with 12K goal-oriented shopping dialogs between salesperson and customer. The dialogs contain rich subjective preferences expressed by customers. - The data was built in two phases - dialog flow simulation and manual paraphrasing - to ensure both dialog quality and language diversity.- The dataset contains annotations of subjective preferences, salesperson dialog acts, referred regions, etc. proposed by experienced sales experts. This provides rich resources for training and evaluating multimodal dialog agents.- They designed 3 tasks on subjective preference disambiguation, referred region understanding and multimodal recommendation to benchmark progress in this area. A baseline model MRA was proposed and analyzed.- The introduced dataset addresses the limitations of existing multimodal dialog datasets by including diverse subjective preferences and multimodal recommendation acts, which are common in real-world shopping scenarios but not well depicted previously.In summary, the key contribution is creating a new challenging multimodal dialog dataset focusing on subjective preferences and recommendation acts, along with benchmark tasks, to facilitate research on building intelligent multimodal recommendation agents.
