# [Method for robotic motion compensation during PET imaging of mobile   subjects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17861)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a prototype robotic system for compensating head motion during positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The goal is to enable PET imaging during natural activities like walking by using a robot to move the PET imaging ring to track the motion of the subject's head. The system uses six parallel string encoders connected between a head-mounted helmet and the imaging ring to measure the 6DOF pose of the head, providing sub-millimeter accuracy. An FPGA interface and modular software architecture focused on minimizing latency. Experiments using a UR3 robot reproducing human head trajectories and a UR5 robot controlling mock PET hardware showed the system can provide coarse motion correction within an 18mm helmet clearance envelope with under 80ms latency. Residual sub-millimeter motion measured by the string encoders also enabled fine motion correction in PET image reconstruction. While further improvements are discussed, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using a robotic system for motion compensation to enable wearable PET imaging during unrestrained activities.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the design and experimental evaluation of a prototype robotic system for compensating human head motion during PET imaging. Specifically:

- The paper presents the system architecture, including string encoders for motion measurement, an FPGA and software components for low-latency processing, and a velocity-controlled UR5 robot to move the PET imaging ring. A key contribution is the design focused on minimizing latency to enable adequate motion compensation.

- Experiments emulate PET imaging using lasers and cameras and reproduce recorded human head motion trajectories using a UR3 robot. 

- Results demonstrate the string encoder measurement accuracy and latency during dynamic motion, the ability of the UR5 robot to compensate for head motion within an 18mm clearance, and sub-millimeter residual motion correction during image reconstruction.

In summary, the main contribution is the prototyping and experimental validation of the concept of robotic compensation of human head motion to enable wearable PET imaging during activities like walking. The results support the feasibility of the approach.

The paper presents a robotic system to support a PET imaging device and compensate for motion of mobile human subjects during scanning. It uses string encoders arranged in a parallel (Stewart Platform) configuration to measure head motion, and a robot to move the imaging device to compensate for coarse motion.
