# [Language Embedded Radiance Fields for Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07970)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we enable robots to perform task-oriented grasping of objects and object parts using only natural language specifications, without requiring task-specific training data?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERFs) can be used to reconstruct 3D scenes and represent them in a way that allows querying object and object part semantics using natural language. 2) By extracting 3D object masks from the LERF using DINO features and then conditioning part queries on these masks, more accurate part-level semantic distributions can be obtained compared to directly querying the LERF.3) Combining these semantic distributions with geometric grasp sampling allows ranking and selecting viable grasps on desired object parts specified through language, enabling task-oriented grasping without part-specific training data.So in summary, the central research question is how to do task-oriented grasping through language specifications using large vision-language models like LERF, and the key hypotheses are around using techniques like 3D object masking and conditional querying to get accurate part-level semantics from the LERF for this task. The overall goal is removing the need for task-specific training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents LERF-TOGO, a method for task-oriented grasping of objects using natural language. The key contributions are:1. Proposes the use of Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) for generating semantic 3D grasp distributions over objects given natural language object and object part queries. 2. Introduces techniques to improve LERF's spatial reasoning, including using DINO features to extract a 3D object mask, and conditional querying of LERF to focus on object sub-parts.3. Integrates LERF-TOGO on a physical robot system and demonstrates its ability to grasp objects by specific parts through natural language on a variety of real household objects.4. Evaluates the system's performance at selecting grasps on the correct objects and object parts, and successfully executing grasps. LERF-TOGO achieved high success rates of 96% correct object, 82% correct part, and 69% successful grasps over 49 unique object-part pairs.5. Demonstrates the flexibility of LERF-TOGO on task-oriented grasping by integrating it with a large language model to automatically generate object part queries based on task descriptions.In summary, the key innovation is using vision-language models like LERF in a zero-shot manner to enable robots to grasp objects and parts through natural language specification. This provides an intuitive interface for non-experts while also supporting task-oriented grasping on a diverse set of objects.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other related work in task-oriented grasping and semantic grasping:Overall Approach:- This paper proposes a novel method called LERF-TOGO that uses Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) and natural language queries to enable zero-shot, task-oriented grasping of object parts. Most prior work trains models on labeled object part datasets.- The key innovation is using LERF's multi-scale contextual embeddings and compositional querying abilities to isolate object parts for grasping. Other semantic grasping works typically don't leverage multi-scale context.Task-Oriented Grasping:- Compared to prior task-oriented grasping works like TaskGraspNet, LERF-TOGO does not require training on annotated grasps for each object part. This could allow it to scale to more diverse objects.- However, it may not capture intricate object affordances as well without real experience. Works like TaskGraspNet learn from interacting with objects and observing humans.- LERF-TOGO relies on vision-language models like CLIP, while prior works often use geometric features or physical simulation. The tradeoffs are improved semantics vs less accuracy.Language interfaces:- Using natural language provides more flexibility than typical category-based grasping. Related works like CLIPort also explore language conditioned policies.- A limitation is language can be ambiguous. LERF-TOGO does not handle complex referring expressions beyond basic object and part descriptors.- To my knowledge, LERF-TOGO is the first to apply compositional queries for task-oriented grasping. This mitigates CLIP's tendency to act as a bag-of-words.In summary, LERF-TOGO innovates in its use of multi-scale LERF queried compositionally with language to enable flexible, zero-shot task-oriented grasping. A tradeoff is less accuracy than methods trained on real experience. The language interface is more flexible but also less robust than structured affordance learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the speed of the end-to-end process. The authors note that the entire pipeline currently takes a few minutes, which may be impractical for time-sensitive applications. They suggest future work on optimizations and regularizations to LERF training could help reduce computation time.- Supporting hierarchy within foreground object groups. The method struggles when there are multiple connected foreground objects (e.g. a bouquet of flowers), as the floodfill groups them together. The authors suggest enabling hierarchy within these groups to isolate individual objects. - Handling scenes with multiple matching objects. Currently the system will arbitrarily choose one object if the query matches multiple instances. The authors suggest improving object disambiguation, such as using referring or comparative expressions.- Evaluating integration with LLMs on more diverse tasks. The authors show promising results using an LLM to generate grasps for tasks, but note evaluating on a wider range of tasks is important future work.- Exploring other prompt interfaces. The authors note sensitivity to wording variations with current part queries. Future work on more robust prompt interfaces or leveraging structured representations could help.- Applying the method to real-world use cases. The experiments are so far limited to tabletop settings. Testing the approach on real applications could reveal challenges to be addressed.Overall, the main directions are improving the speed and scalability of the approach, enhancing the hierarchical reasoning and disambiguation capabilities, expanding the flexibility of natural language interfaces, and validating the method on more complex real-world tasks. The authors lay out an extensive set of opportunities for future work to build on their approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents Language Embedded Radiance Fields for Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Grasping (LERF-TOGO), a method for enabling robots to grasp specific parts of objects using natural language instructions. The key idea is to reconstruct a 3D scene using a Language Embedded Radiance Field (LERF), which embeds CLIP features into a neural radiance field. Given a natural language query specifying an object and object part, LERF-TOGO first extracts a 3D object mask from the scene using DINO features. It then performs a conditional LERF query focused on this object mask to obtain a distribution highlighting the relevant object part. Finally, grasps are sampled from the scene geometry and ranked based on their alignment with the part distribution, allowing the robot to select a grasp on the specified part. Experiments on a physical robot demonstrate LERF-TOGO can successfully grasp objects by parts indicated in natural language prompts around 70% of the time, enabling more human-centric and task-oriented grasping.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents LERF-TOGO, a method for robots to grasp objects by specific parts based on natural language commands. LERF-TOGO first captures RGB images of a scene and reconstructs it as a 3D Language Embedded Radiance Field (LERF) using a neural radiance field. LERF encodes multiscale CLIP features which allow querying parts of the scene with natural language. However, directly querying LERF often highlights incomplete regions of objects. To address this, LERF-TOGO extracts a 3D object mask using flood-filled DINO features initialized at the highest LERF activation. It then performs a conditioned LERF query focused on the object mask to get a part-level distribution. Finally, it samples viable grasps from this distribution using an off-the-shelf grasp planner and ranks them based on the part activations.Experiments evaluate LERF-TOGO on 31 household objects with natural language part queries like "mug; handle" and "flower; stem". Results show it selects grasps on the correct part 82% of the time, with an overall grasp success rate of 69%. The key contributions are using vision-language models in a zero-shot way to encode multiscale language into a 3D scene, extracting spatial object masks to enable conditioned part queries, and using this to produce a semantic grasp distribution for task-oriented grasping. Limitations include speed and handling connected object groups. Overall, it demonstrates promising capability for robots to understand natural language object parts for more semantic grasping.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes \algabbr{} (\algabbr{}), a method to enable robots to grasp objects by specific parts using natural language queries. The key steps are:1) Reconstruct a 3D scene using Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF), which encodes multi-scale CLIP features into a neural radiance field (NeRF). 2) Given an object query, find the most relevant 3D point in LERF and use 3D DINO features to floodfill a 3D object mask. 3) Condition the part query on just the extracted object mask when querying LERF to obtain a semantic distribution over the object indicating likelihood of the part.  4) Sample grasps from the 3D geometry and rerank them based on the semantic part distribution, executing the top ranked grasp on a physical robot.In summary, the paper combines the language understanding and multi-scale reasoning of LERF with floodfilled object masks from DINO features to enable conditional part queries. It integrates these elements into a full system on a physical robot for grasping objects by specific parts using natural language.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of enabling robots to grasp objects by specific parts in order to perform tasks safely and effectively. The key question is how to enable robots to grasp objects by desired parts using natural language specifications, without needing large amounts of training data for every object and object part.Some key points:- Grasping objects by specific parts is important for safety and executing tasks, but current learning-based grasp planners lack this capability as they mainly consider geometry.- Using natural language to specify parts to grasp is flexible and can handle new objects, but most methods rely on detectors that require part-specific training data.- The proposed method LERF-TOGO uses a pretrained vision-language model (CLIP) with a novel 3D representation called Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) to enable specifying parts to grasp in a zero-shot manner without part-specific training.- LERF represents a scene as a 3D neural radiance field fused with CLIP features, which allows querying object and object part relevance via natural language. - To enable robust part queries, LERF-TOGO extracts a 3D object mask from LERF using DINO features for better spatial grouping, and conditions part queries on this mask.- Grasps are generated from an off-the-shelf grasp sampler, then ranked based on geometric and semantic scores from LERF-TOGO to bias towards task-relevant parts.- Experiments on a physical robot grasping a diverse set of objects show it can successfully grasp the correct object part over 80% of the time without any part-specific training.In summary, the key contribution is using vision-language models in a zero-shot way with 3D neural scene representations for flexible, part-based grasping via natural language. This avoids the limitations of existing methods that require training on each object part.
