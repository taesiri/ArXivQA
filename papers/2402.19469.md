# [Humanoid Locomotion as Next Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 

- Mastering real-world humanoid locomotion is an open and challenging problem in robotics. Prior methods that use either model-based control or reinforcement learning have limitations in transferring to the real world. 

Method:

- The paper proposes a self-supervised approach to learn locomotion policies by autoregressive modeling of diverse sensorimotor trajectories.

- The key idea is to frame real-world humanoid control as a next token prediction problem, similar to next word prediction in language models.

- A causal transformer model is trained to predict multimodal sequences of observations and actions in an aligned manner. Missing modalities like actions are handled via masking.

- The model is trained on a diverse dataset collected from 4 sources: RL policies, model-based controllers, human motion capture, and YouTube videos. The diversity enables the model to leverage both complete and incomplete trajectories.

Contributions:

- The method enables a full-sized Digit humanoid robot to walk in complex real-world environments in San Francisco zero-shot, without any environment adaptation.

- Systematic simulations demonstrate that the approach reaches comparable performance to state-of-the-art RL methods in the tested environments.

- Ablations verify key design choices like modality-aligned prediction and benefits of joint modeling of observations and actions.

- Scaling studies demonstrate that the approach benefits from more data, longer context, and larger models, highlighting a promising direction for further improvements.

In summary, the paper presents a self-supervised approach for real-world humanoid locomotion by framing control as generative modeling of diverse sensorimotor trajectories. The method shows promising zero-shot transfer results and scaling properties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an approach for real-world humanoid locomotion by training a transformer model to autoregressively predict sequences of observations and actions from a diverse dataset of simulated and real sensorimotor trajectories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a self-supervised approach for real-world humanoid locomotion by training a transformer model to autoregressively predict sensorimotor trajectories. Specifically:

- They cast humanoid control as a next token prediction problem, similar to language modeling, where the model is trained to predict the next token (sensor or motor signal) given the previous context. 

- They show this approach allows the model to be trained on diverse sensorimotor trajectories with missing modalities, by treating missing signals as masked tokens. This enables incorporating trajectories from various sources like neural network policies, model predictive control, motion capture and YouTube videos.

- They demonstrate their model enables a full-sized humanoid robot (DigiT) to walk in the real world zero-shot after training on a dataset of 27 hours of walking data. The model can also generalize to unseen commands like walking backwards.

- Their ablation studies analyze different modeling choices and show the benefits of predictive training with both states and actions, modality-aligned prediction, and joint training on complete and incomplete trajectories.

In summary, the key contribution is showing the promise of self-supervised generative modeling of sensorimotor trajectories from diverse offline datasets to acquire locomotion policies that can be directly deployed on real humanoid robots.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes modeling humanoid control as a next token prediction problem like language modeling. What are the key benefits of framing the problem this way compared to more traditional approaches like reinforcement learning or imitation learning?

2. The method trains a causal transformer model to predict complete input sequences including both sensory and motor tokens. What is the motivation behind modeling the joint data distribution rather than just the conditional action distribution? How does this enable the use of imperfect demonstration data?

3. The paper introduces a technique to handle missing modalities in the training data by replacing them with learned mask tokens. Explain how this allows the incorporation of human videos lacking action labels. What inductive biases might this impose on the learned representations? 

4. The transformer model is trained to perform aligned prediction, where each input token predicts the next token from the same modality. Compare this to a modality-agnostic approach. What impact might alignment have on handling noise and error propagation during autoregressive inference?

5. The model is trained on a diverse dataset combining trajectories from multiple sources - neural network policies, model predictive control, motion capture etc. Discuss the tradeoffs between joint training on this aggregated dataset versus staged pretraining. When might one approach be preferred over the other?

6. An inverse kinematics optimization is used to retarget human motion capture onto the robot morphology. Explain this process and discuss any challenges or sources of suboptimality that could impact the quality of the transferred trajectories. 

7. The paper demonstrates an ability to generalize to unseen commands like backward walking at test time. Speculate on what properties of the self-supervised training objective enable such zero-shot generalization.

8. Scaling studies show that longer context, more data, and larger models improve performance. Discuss any optimization challenges, overfitting risks, or hardware constraints that could limit further scaling. How might the approach adapt to such bottlenecks?

9. Prediction error on a held-out validation set is found to strongly correlate with trajectory tracking error. Why do you think this correlation exists? Can you think of any cases or scenarios where this relationship might break down?

10. The method is currently applied to locomotion but the overall framework seems applicable to other robotic control problems. Discuss how you might adapt the approach to a complex manipulation task while accounting for differences like high-dimensional vision inputs.
