# [Versatile Telescopic-Wheeled-Legged Locomotion of Tachyon 3 via   Full-Centroidal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on control and motion planning of a novel telescopic-wheeled-legged robot called Tachyon 3. Tachyon 3 has a unique hardware design with telescopic legs ending in wheels, which poses several challenges: limited degrees of freedom in the feet, complicated non-holonomic constraints from the wheels, tight joint limits to avoid collisions, and position-controlled actuators. The goal is to achieve versatile, smooth and dynamic motions on Tachyon 3 despite these hardware constraints.

Solution:
The paper proposes using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan motions for Tachyon 3. The specific contributions are:

1) They apply a full-centroidal dynamics model in the NMPC formulation. This captures the accurate kinematics constraints and dynamics of Tachyon 3.

2) They propose using an internal state integrator so that state feedback can be incorporated in the NMPC for position-controlled systems like Tachyon 3. This avoids oscillations in the position commands.  

3) They design a complete control pipeline to implement the NMPC with perception and reactive safety control on the real-time embedded system of Tachyon 3.

4) They demonstrate the capabilities of their approach through simulated comparisons and hardware experiments of Tachyon 3 traversing steps perceptively. The motion stays within tight joint limits while avoiding collisions.

In summary, the paper presents an NMPC framework tailored to the unique dynamics of Tachyon 3. By addressing challenges like state feedback and computational limits, they are able to achieve versatile motions responding to perceptual constraints on the real robot. The experiments highlight improved performance over prior control methods.
