# [Versatile Telescopic-Wheeled-Legged Locomotion of Tachyon 3 via   Full-Centroidal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on control and motion planning of a novel telescopic-wheeled-legged robot called Tachyon 3. Tachyon 3 has a unique hardware design with telescopic legs ending in wheels, which poses several challenges: limited degrees of freedom in the feet, complicated non-holonomic constraints from the wheels, tight joint limits to avoid collisions, and position-controlled actuators. The goal is to achieve versatile, smooth and dynamic motions on Tachyon 3 despite these hardware constraints.

Solution:
The paper proposes using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan motions for Tachyon 3. The specific contributions are:

1) They apply a full-centroidal dynamics model in the NMPC formulation. This captures the accurate kinematics constraints and dynamics of Tachyon 3.

2) They propose using an internal state integrator so that state feedback can be incorporated in the NMPC for position-controlled systems like Tachyon 3. This avoids oscillations in the position commands.  

3) They design a complete control pipeline to implement the NMPC with perception and reactive safety control on the real-time embedded system of Tachyon 3.

4) They demonstrate the capabilities of their approach through simulated comparisons and hardware experiments of Tachyon 3 traversing steps perceptively. The motion stays within tight joint limits while avoiding collisions.

In summary, the paper presents an NMPC framework tailored to the unique dynamics of Tachyon 3. By addressing challenges like state feedback and computational limits, they are able to achieve versatile motions responding to perceptual constraints on the real robot. The experiments highlight improved performance over prior control methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control framework to achieve versatile and dynamic motion generation for the telescopic-wheeled-legged robot Tachyon 3 under harsh physical and environmental constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Application of the full-centroidal NMPC formulation to the novel hardware Tachyon 3 with novel physical and environmental constraints. 

2) State feedback using an internal state integrator to apply NMPC to robots that employ high-gain position-controllers.

3) Control pipeline and implementation details to integrate NMPC and other modules like the state integrator and CBF-QP on an on-board PC with limited computation resources.  

4) Validation through simulation study against a previous controller and real-world hardware experiment on perceptive locomotion over structured terrains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework for the telescopic-wheeled-legged robot Tachyon 3. Could you explain in more detail why the full-centroidal model was chosen to represent the dynamics and constraints of this unique robot, compared to other modeling options like single rigid body dynamics or full multibody dynamics?

2. One contribution mentioned is the state feedback using an internal state integrator to enable NMPC for robots with high-gain position controllers. Can you elaborate on why naive state feedback causes oscillations in the commands and how the internal state integrator helps mitigate this issue? 

3. The paper employs a structure exploiting primal-dual interior point method to solve the finite-dimensional NLP at each MPC iteration. What are some of the key aspects of this algorithm and how does it help improve computational speed compared to more general nonlinear programming solvers?

4. The foot feasible region constraints defined by convex polygons play an important role for swing foot collision avoidance. How exactly are these regions generated from the perception pipeline and how do they change between the ascending vs descending cases? 

5. The contact sequence and timing is assumed to be provided by a higher level contact planner. What considerations need to go into designing an appropriate contact planner that works well with the NMPC formulation?

6. Can you explain the differences in how the torque limits are handled between the full-centroidal model NMPC compared to the previous CBF-QP controller? What are the tradeoffs?

7. The paper demonstrates trotting locomotion in the experiments. How difficult would it be to extend the framework to other gait patterns and what modifications would need to be made?

8. What role does the CBF-QP play at each control cycle along with the NMPC? Why is it still needed despite having optimized trajectories from NMPC?

9. The perception pipeline extracts surfaces for the foot placement constraints. How robust is the overall framework if there are errors or noise in the perceived environmental surfaces? 

10. For real-time implementation, what are some ways the computation time of each NMPC iteration could be reduced further to achieve higher update rates?
