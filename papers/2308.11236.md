# ROSGPT_Vision: Commanding Robots Using Only Language Models' Prompts

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) be integrated with robotics and computer vision to enable robots to seamlessly interact with and understand visual data through natural language? More specifically, the paper introduces a new robotic design pattern called "Prompting Robotic Modalities" (PRM) and a novel framework called ROSGPT_Vision to implement this pattern. The key ideas are:- Robots should be designed with separate "promptable" modalities (vision, audio, etc) that can be queried individually via prompts. - Each modality has its own associated language model (MLM) to interpret prompts. For vision, this is a vision language model (VLM).- The central "Task Modality" collates prompt responses and decides actions, using a generic large language model (LLM). - ROSGPT_Vision implements PRM for visual data, with the Camera Node handling visual prompts via a VLM and the GPT Consultation Node handling task actions via an LLM.So in summary, the central research question is how PRM and ROSGPT_Vision can enable robots to seamlessly understand and act upon visual data through natural language prompts and integration of LLMs/VLMs. The paper aims to prove the validity of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces two key contributions to robotics:1. A new robotic design pattern called "Prompting Robotic Modalities" (PRM): This pattern proposes that robots should be designed with the capability to prompt each sensory/interaction modality (vision, audition, tactile, etc.) separately using modality-specific language models. The central idea is to actively probe each modality for precise data gathering instead of passively receiving sensor inputs. 2. A new framework called ROSGPT_Vision that implements the PRM pattern: This framework allows robots to understand and interact with visual data through natural language prompts. It separates the visual description of images from the ontology-based action planning. The user mainly configures it by designing effective prompts.To demonstrate the utility of PRM/ROSGPT_Vision, the authors built an application called CarMate that monitors driver behavior and issues alerts. The key innovations are the modular prompting of vision separately from actions, the focus on prompt engineering, and the open-source framework for community enhancement. Overall, this paper introduces an extensible new robotic design approach using language model prompting to bridge vision, language, and actions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper introduces a new robotic design pattern called Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM) and a framework called ROSGPT_Vision that implements PRM to enable robots to understand and act on visual data through natural language interaction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a high-level analysis of how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces a new robotic design pattern called "Prompting Robotic Modalities" (PRM) that emphasizes querying each robotic modality separately with tailored prompts. This is a novel approach compared to traditional robotic system designs. - The paper also proposes a new framework called ROSGPT_Vision that implements the PRM pattern for visual data, using vision language models to extract image semantics. This integrates language models with robotics and computer vision in an innovative way not seen in prior work.- The paper builds on top of ROSGPT, a previous framework for converting natural language to robotic commands. However, ROSGPT_Vision focuses specifically on handling visual data through natural language interactions. - Other related works like PromptCraft and robotGPT have used ChatGPT for robotic control through language. But ROSGPT_Vision goes a step further by separating visual description from task actions and using prompts in a modular way.- The paper demonstrates the utility of ROSGPT_Vision via an application called CarMate. While other research has tackled driver monitoring, CarMate showcases the flexibility of ROSGPT_Vision through simple prompt engineering.In summary, the key novelties of this paper compared to prior research seem to be: 1) The PRM design pattern, 2) The modularity and prompting approach of ROSGPT_Vision, and 3) The demonstration of these concepts via the CarMate application. The paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in bringing together language models, computer vision, and robotics in a principled way.
