# ROSGPT_Vision: Commanding Robots Using Only Language Models' Prompts

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) be integrated with robotics and computer vision to enable robots to seamlessly interact with and understand visual data through natural language? More specifically, the paper introduces a new robotic design pattern called "Prompting Robotic Modalities" (PRM) and a novel framework called ROSGPT_Vision to implement this pattern. The key ideas are:- Robots should be designed with separate "promptable" modalities (vision, audio, etc) that can be queried individually via prompts. - Each modality has its own associated language model (MLM) to interpret prompts. For vision, this is a vision language model (VLM).- The central "Task Modality" collates prompt responses and decides actions, using a generic large language model (LLM). - ROSGPT_Vision implements PRM for visual data, with the Camera Node handling visual prompts via a VLM and the GPT Consultation Node handling task actions via an LLM.So in summary, the central research question is how PRM and ROSGPT_Vision can enable robots to seamlessly understand and act upon visual data through natural language prompts and integration of LLMs/VLMs. The paper aims to prove the validity of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces two key contributions to robotics:1. A new robotic design pattern called "Prompting Robotic Modalities" (PRM): This pattern proposes that robots should be designed with the capability to prompt each sensory/interaction modality (vision, audition, tactile, etc.) separately using modality-specific language models. The central idea is to actively probe each modality for precise data gathering instead of passively receiving sensor inputs. 2. A new framework called ROSGPT_Vision that implements the PRM pattern: This framework allows robots to understand and interact with visual data through natural language prompts. It separates the visual description of images from the ontology-based action planning. The user mainly configures it by designing effective prompts.To demonstrate the utility of PRM/ROSGPT_Vision, the authors built an application called CarMate that monitors driver behavior and issues alerts. The key innovations are the modular prompting of vision separately from actions, the focus on prompt engineering, and the open-source framework for community enhancement. Overall, this paper introduces an extensible new robotic design approach using language model prompting to bridge vision, language, and actions.
