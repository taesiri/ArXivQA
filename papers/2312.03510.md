# [Towards Sobolev Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03510)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for creating efficient and accurate surrogate neural network models by incorporating sensitivity information throughout the training and pruning process. It starts by training an oversized network which is then pruned down using Interval Adjoint Significance Analysis to find the smallest architecture that maintains prediction accuracy. However, pruning typically degrades recovery of derivative information critical for many applications. Thus, the pruned network is fine-tuned with Sobolev Training, using extra supervision from derivative samples to regain sensitivity prediction accuracy. This allows creating justifiably small surrogate models that capture both values and derivatives of the original complex model at a fraction of the computational cost. The techniques are evaluated on a case study of pricing a Basket option modelled through a stochastic differential equation. However, the approach serves as a general framework for surrogate modeling of stochastic simulations across domains. Challenges in using pathwise derivatives are addressed through payoff smoothing. The combination of interval analysis, algorithmic differentiation, model pruning and differential machine learning provides an avenue for efficient and accurate surrogate modelling.
