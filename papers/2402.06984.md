# [Speech motion anomaly detection via cross-modal translation of 4D motion   fields from tagged MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the relationship between tongue motion patterns during speech and the resulting speech acoustics is important for assessing speech quality and developing treatment strategies, especially for patients with speech disorders. 
- Jointly analyzing heterogeneous modalities like MRI tracking data and speech acoustics is challenging. 
- Anomaly detection typically relies on data from a single modality, but multiple modalities could give better detection when there are incongruencies between modalities.

Methods:
- Collected paired tagged MRI (captures internal tongue motions) and speech audio data from 36 healthy subjects and 3 tongue cancer patients saying short phrases.
- Generated 4D motion fields from MRI and converted audio to 2D mel-spectrograms.  
- Trained a cross-modal translator on healthy data to map 4D motion fields to 2D mel-spectrograms. Used 3D CNN or 3D CNN + Transformer architectures.  
- Translator is expected to perform well reconstructing spectrograms for healthy test data but not as well for patient data since patterns may be anomalous compared to training data.
- Used one-class SVM trained on healthy reconstructed spectrograms to distinguish healthy vs patient.

Results: 
- Translator metrics (spectrogram correlation, waveform quality score) were higher for healthy test subjects than patients.
- One-class SVM effectively distinguished healthy vs patient subjects based on reconstructed spectrograms.

Contributions:
- Novel method using cross-modal translator and one-class SVM anomaly detection applied to speech MRI and acoustics.
- Demonstrated potential to detect anomalous speech motion patterns in patients for understanding speech production differences.
- Framework is generalizable to other speech disorders.
