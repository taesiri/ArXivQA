# [MedDM:LLM-executable clinical guidance tree for clinical decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02441)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a medical diagnostic decision-making dataset (MedDM) and a new decision tree structure called LLM-executable clinical guidance trees (CGT) to address the lack of specialization in current medical LLMs. The authors extract 1202 clinical flowcharts from over 5000 medical textbooks and guidelines to construct the MedDM dataset. They also define the LLM-executable CGT, which uses natural language to represent decision tree nodes to make the structure compatible for LLMs. Based on this, they propose an inference engine called CDM that allows LLMs to perform reasoning on CGTs to diagnose patients through multi-turn dialogues. The dialog framework retrieves relevant CGTs from the knowledge base to guide the LLM's response generation. Constructing the MedDM and proposing interpretable decision trees and reasoning frameworks allows medical LLMs to conduct more specialized diagnosis conversations and provide accurate advice. This has the potential to simplify and enhance real-world medical diagnosis.
