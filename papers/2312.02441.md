# [MedDM:LLM-executable clinical guidance tree for clinical decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current medical LLMs lack specialization for medical diagnosis scenarios. They act more like QA systems with limited ability to inquire symptoms and provide specific medical advice. This hinders their practical application.
- There is no suitable clinical guidance tree dataset that can be directly used with LLMs to provide structured diagnostic knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LLM-executable clinical guidance trees (CGTs) - a decision tree structure represented in natural language that allows LLM reasoning. 
- Construct a medical diagnostic decision-making dataset (MedDM) from over 5000 medical literature containing 1202 decision trees across 12 departments and 500+ diseases.
- Develop a flowchart recognition pipeline to identify shapes, connectors, text from images and reconstruct decision trees. Manual calibration done to ensure accuracy.
- Propose LLM-interactive IEET tree format for easy LLM interpretation and a CDM engine for LLM reasoning on CGTs.
- Develop a decision retrieval based dialog framework that retrieves relevant CGTs to guide multi-turn patient-LLM conversation for diagnosis.

Main Contributions:
- Identify the problem of lack of specialization of medical LLMs and propose the use of executable clinical guidance trees to address it.
- Construct a structured diagnostic decision dataset MedDM from medical flowcharts through a systematic flowchart recognition and transformation pipeline.
- Propose LLM-friendly CGT format and CDM engine to allow LLMs to perform reasoning on CGTs.
- Develop a retrieval based dialog framework for patient-LLM multi-turn conversations for diagnosis using CGTs.

The paper makes significant contributions in enabling LLMs to make specialized medical diagnosis using structured clinical knowledge in the form of executable guidance trees. The constructed dataset and proposed techniques open up the ability for LLMs to have meaningful multi-turn conversations with patients.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a medical diagnostic decision-making dataset called MedDM, extracted from flowcharts in clinical guidelines, as well as a framework to transform these flowcharts into LLM-executable clinical guidance trees that can be used by large language models to conduct multi-turn medical dialogues and diagnose patients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies the challenge that current medical LLMs lack specialization for medical diagnosis scenarios, in that they cannot obtain complete information through multiple rounds of inquiries and provide specific medical advice. 

2. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a new decision tree structure called "LLM-executable clinical guidance tree" (CGT) that can be directly used by large language models. It also collects a new medical diagnostic decision-making dataset (MedDM) constructed from flowcharts in clinical practice guidelines.

3. The paper proposes a decision-retrieval based generation framework that utilizes the collected CGTs as an external knowledge base to aid the LLM in conducting multi-turn dialogues with patients and generating more informative and accurate responses.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) identifying the low specialization issue of medical LLMs, (2) proposing LLM-executable CGT and constructing the MedDM dataset, and (3) developing a decision-retrieval based dialog framework to leverage the CGTs for improved medical diagnosis.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Medical diagnosis 
- Low specialization 
- Diagnostic decision-making 
- Clinical guidance tree (CGT)
- LLM-executable clinical guidance tree
- Medical diagnostic decision-making dataset (MedDM) 
- Flowchart recognition
- Decision-retrieval based generation framework
- Differential diagnosis
- Condition node
- Action node
- LLM-interactive IEET (If-Elif-Else Tree)
- CDM (Clinical Decision Making) engine
- Multi-turn dialogues

The paper proposes the concept of LLM-executable clinical guidance trees, which are enhanced decision tree structures that can be directly interpreted by large language models to make medical diagnoses. It also describes the creation of a dataset called MedDM which contains these trees, extracted from medical literature. A key focus is improving the specialization of medical LLMs to conduct multi-turn inquiries and provide specific diagnosis advice. The decision-retrieval framework and differential diagnosis knowledge from the trees aim to achieve this.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new decision tree structure called "LLM-executable clinical guidance tree." How is this structure different from traditional clinical guidance trees and why is it more suitable for use with large language models?

2. The paper constructs a medical diagnostic decision-making dataset (MedDM) by extracting flowcharts from medical literature. What were some of the key challenges in identifying and transforming these flowcharts into structured decision trees? 

3. The paper describes a "CDM engine" that performs reasoning on the clinical guidance trees using a large language model. Can you explain in more detail how the model evaluates each node and decides between the three potential actions (next condition node, next action node, ask further)?

4. What techniques does the paper use to deal with cyclic structures and overlapping paths when transforming flowcharts into clinical guidance trees? How do these techniques ensure accurate representations?  

5. Why does the paper convert the clinical guidance trees into an "LLM-interactive IEET" structure before feeding them to the large language model? What are the advantages of this structure compared to a standard tree representation?

6. Explain the target CGT retrieval process in the dialog framework. Why is the patient dialog first rewritten by ChatGPT before computing relevance scores?

7. Walk through the full process of how the large language model conducts a multi-turn dialog with a patient using the retrieved clinical guidance tree. What are the key steps involved?  

8. What criteria and verification process did the authors use to ensure accurate flowchart recognition and clinical guidance tree transformation? What quality assurance measures were implemented?  

9. What are some potential limitations or errors that could exist in the clinical guidance trees constructed from the medical literature? How might these affect the performance of the overall system?

10. The constructed dataset contains 1202 decision trees spanning 12 hospital departments and over 500 diseases. In what ways could the authors further expand this dataset to increase its coverage and applicability?
