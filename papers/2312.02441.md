# [MedDM:LLM-executable clinical guidance tree for clinical decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current medical LLMs lack specialization for medical diagnosis scenarios. They act more like QA systems with limited ability to inquire symptoms and provide specific medical advice. This hinders their practical application.
- There is no suitable clinical guidance tree dataset that can be directly used with LLMs to provide structured diagnostic knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LLM-executable clinical guidance trees (CGTs) - a decision tree structure represented in natural language that allows LLM reasoning. 
- Construct a medical diagnostic decision-making dataset (MedDM) from over 5000 medical literature containing 1202 decision trees across 12 departments and 500+ diseases.
- Develop a flowchart recognition pipeline to identify shapes, connectors, text from images and reconstruct decision trees. Manual calibration done to ensure accuracy.
- Propose LLM-interactive IEET tree format for easy LLM interpretation and a CDM engine for LLM reasoning on CGTs.
- Develop a decision retrieval based dialog framework that retrieves relevant CGTs to guide multi-turn patient-LLM conversation for diagnosis.

Main Contributions:
- Identify the problem of lack of specialization of medical LLMs and propose the use of executable clinical guidance trees to address it.
- Construct a structured diagnostic decision dataset MedDM from medical flowcharts through a systematic flowchart recognition and transformation pipeline.
- Propose LLM-friendly CGT format and CDM engine to allow LLMs to perform reasoning on CGTs.
- Develop a retrieval based dialog framework for patient-LLM multi-turn conversations for diagnosis using CGTs.

The paper makes significant contributions in enabling LLMs to make specialized medical diagnosis using structured clinical knowledge in the form of executable guidance trees. The constructed dataset and proposed techniques open up the ability for LLMs to have meaningful multi-turn conversations with patients.
