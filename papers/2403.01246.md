# [Dual Graph Attention based Disentanglement Multiple Instance Learning   for Brain Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing brain age estimation models using MRI data have limitations: 1) They overlook the heterogeneous nature of brain aging where different regions degenerate at different rates; 2) They do not account for redundant age-independent information in brain structure that can interfere with age prediction. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning framework called Dual Graph Attention based Disentanglement Multi-Instance Learning (DGA-DMIL) to address the above limitations.

- It treats 3D MRI data as a bag of 2D slice instances which are fed into a CNN backbone to extract spatial features from each instance. 

- A dual graph attention aggregator is proposed to aggregate features within (spatial aggregator) and between (instance aggregator) instances by learning intra- and inter-instance relationships. This assigns different importance weights to different instances for age prediction.

- A disentanglement branch is introduced to separate the backbone features into age-related and age-independent structural representations. This prevents redundant information from interfering with age prediction.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel end-to-end multi-instance learning framework to exploit intra- and inter-instance relationships for accurate brain age estimation using MRI.

- Introduces a dual graph attention aggregator to address heterogeneous aging by evaluating differing impacts of brain regions on age prediction.

- Proposes a disentanglement branch to separate age-related and age-independent features, preventing negative effects of redundant information.   

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in brain age estimation on two large datasets, with Mean Absolute Error of 2.12 years on 35,291 UK Biobank subjects.

- Provides visualization and insights into brain regions that significantly contribute to age prediction through instance contribution scores.
