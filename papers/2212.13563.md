# [Noise-aware Learning from Web-crawled Image-Text Data for Image   Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13563)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is:

How can we develop an image captioning model that is robust to noisy image-text pairs in web-crawled datasets, while still being able to leverage the rich visual knowledge in the data? 

The key hypothesis seems to be that by making the captioning model alignment-level-controllable via a discrete conditioning signal during training, it can learn to generate high quality captions at inference time by setting the control signal to indicate a high desired alignment level. This allows the model to take advantage of the full dataset during training without being overly disrupted by misaligned noisy pairs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and conclusion, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a noise-aware learning framework called NoC (Noise-aware Captioning) for image captioning using web-crawled image-text data. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Web-crawled data contains inherent noise (misaligned image-text pairs) that hampers learning for image captioning models. 

- Existing methods like filtering discard useful data and reduce learning.

- They propose an alignment-level controllable captioning model that is trained using the alignment level of image-text pairs as a control signal. 

- This allows generating captions of desired alignment quality at inference time by setting the control signal, enabling robustness to noise.

- Experiments show their method outperforms baselines in zero-shot captioning and self-retrieval, generating higher quality captions.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a noise-aware learning approach that uses alignment level control signals for making image captioning robust to the noise in web-crawled data, outperforming other methods.
