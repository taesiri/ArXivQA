## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Lodge: A Coarse to Fine Diffusion Network for Long Dance Generation Guided by the Characteristic Dance Primitives":

Problem:
- Generating long, high-quality 3D dance motions that synchronize with music is challenging due to the need for both capturing local motion details and global choreographic patterns.
- Existing methods based on autoregressive models or VAEs struggle with error accumulation, motion freezing, and overfitting issues.  
- Recent diffusion models can generate short, high-quality dance clips but lack global structure when creating longer dances.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage coarse-to-fine diffusion network called Lodge.
- Introduces "characteristic dance primitives", which are expressive 8-frame key motions that act as an intermediate representation.
- The first global diffusion stage focuses on learning overall choreography and generates sparse dance primitives.
- The second local diffusion stage takes guidance from primitives and generates detailed short dance segments in parallel.
- A foot refine block is used to optimize foot-ground contact.

Main Contributions:
- A new coarse-to-fine network architecture for long dance generation using two diffusion models.
- Characteristic dance primitives that guide the generation and transfer global choreographic patterns.
- Parallel generation of detailed short dance segments guided by primitives.
- A foot refine block to enhance motion realism by reducing foot skating.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on FineDance and AIST++ datasets, compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple motion quality and diversity metrics.
- Qualitative experiments show Lodge generates more coherent and expressive long dance.

The paper makes notable progress towards generating extremely long, choreographically coherent dances with richness in local details through its novel coarse-to-fine diffusion framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine diffusion framework called Lodge that generates long, high-quality dances by first producing characteristic dance primitives to guide local diffusions to generate dance segments in parallel, while optimizing foot contacts to enhance realism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that can produce long dances in a parallel manner. The method is capable of learning the overall choreographic patterns while ensuring the quality of local movements.

2. The proposal of characteristic dance primitives as intermediate representations between two diffusion models. These primitives possess significant expressiveness and can transfer choreographic patterns. 

3. A foot refine block and a foot-ground contact loss to eliminate artifacts like skating, floating, and ground inter-penetration, improving the motion realism.

In summary, the key innovation is the two-stage coarse-to-fine architecture with characteristic dance primitives as the intermediate representation, which allows generating extremely long, high-quality and expressive dances efficiently. The foot refine block also helps enhance the motion realism.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Coarse-to-fine diffusion network: The proposed two-stage architecture with global diffusion and local diffusion.

- Characteristic dance primitives: The expressive 8-frame key motions proposed as intermediate representations to guide the diffusion models.

- Hard/soft diffusion guidance: The strategies used to incorporate the dance primitives to guide the local diffusions - hard guidance for strict consistency, soft guidance for flexibility.  

- Foot refine block: The module introduced to optimize foot-ground contact and reduce foot skating artifacts.

- Long dance generation: The task of generating high-quality, diverse dance motions for extremely long input music. 

- Motion quality metrics: Metrics like FID and foot skating ratio used to evaluate quality.

- Motion diversity metrics: Metrics like diversity in kinetic and geometric feature spaces.

- Choreography rules: Rules like genre consistency, beat alignment, and structure alignment that guide the learning of music-dance correlation.

The key focus of the paper is enabling the parallel generation of long, high-quality dances through the proposed coarse-to-fine diffusion framework and dance primitives.
