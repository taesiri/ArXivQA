## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Lodge: A Coarse to Fine Diffusion Network for Long Dance Generation Guided by the Characteristic Dance Primitives":

Problem:
- Generating long, high-quality 3D dance motions that synchronize with music is challenging due to the need for both capturing local motion details and global choreographic patterns.
- Existing methods based on autoregressive models or VAEs struggle with error accumulation, motion freezing, and overfitting issues.  
- Recent diffusion models can generate short, high-quality dance clips but lack global structure when creating longer dances.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage coarse-to-fine diffusion network called Lodge.
- Introduces "characteristic dance primitives", which are expressive 8-frame key motions that act as an intermediate representation.
- The first global diffusion stage focuses on learning overall choreography and generates sparse dance primitives.
- The second local diffusion stage takes guidance from primitives and generates detailed short dance segments in parallel.
- A foot refine block is used to optimize foot-ground contact.

Main Contributions:
- A new coarse-to-fine network architecture for long dance generation using two diffusion models.
- Characteristic dance primitives that guide the generation and transfer global choreographic patterns.
- Parallel generation of detailed short dance segments guided by primitives.
- A foot refine block to enhance motion realism by reducing foot skating.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on FineDance and AIST++ datasets, compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple motion quality and diversity metrics.
- Qualitative experiments show Lodge generates more coherent and expressive long dance.

The paper makes notable progress towards generating extremely long, choreographically coherent dances with richness in local details through its novel coarse-to-fine diffusion framework.
