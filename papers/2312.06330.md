# [Navigating Open Set Scenarios for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06330)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper tackles the novel and unexplored problem of open-set skeleton-based action recognition (OS-SAR), where the model needs to recognize known actions while also detecting unknown actions not seen during training. The authors formally introduce the OS-SAR task, establish a large-scale benchmark spanning three datasets and three backbones, and assess seven existing open-set methods as baselines. They find most techniques struggle to deliver consistent performance, revealing limitations in handling the distinct sparse and sequential structure of skeletal data streams lacking background context. To address this, the authors propose CrossMax, an approach leveraging joint, bone and velocity modalities of body poses. CrossMax employs cross-modality distribution alignment in latent spaces during training and a distance-based refinement of predictions at test time. A key component is the cross-modality logits refinement to balance open-set novelty detection and closed-set classification. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across all datasets and backbones. The disentanglement of open-set probability between in- and out-of-distribution skeletal sequences is notably improved by CrossMax. Through extensive analysis and ablations, the paper makes a compelling case that CrossMax effectively navigates the open-set challenges intrinsic to sparse yet informative body pose sequences.
