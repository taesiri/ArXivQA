# [Navigating Open Set Scenarios for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06330)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper tackles the novel and unexplored problem of open-set skeleton-based action recognition (OS-SAR), where the model needs to recognize known actions while also detecting unknown actions not seen during training. The authors formally introduce the OS-SAR task, establish a large-scale benchmark spanning three datasets and three backbones, and assess seven existing open-set methods as baselines. They find most techniques struggle to deliver consistent performance, revealing limitations in handling the distinct sparse and sequential structure of skeletal data streams lacking background context. To address this, the authors propose CrossMax, an approach leveraging joint, bone and velocity modalities of body poses. CrossMax employs cross-modality distribution alignment in latent spaces during training and a distance-based refinement of predictions at test time. A key component is the cross-modality logits refinement to balance open-set novelty detection and closed-set classification. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across all datasets and backbones. The disentanglement of open-set probability between in- and out-of-distribution skeletal sequences is notably improved by CrossMax. Through extensive analysis and ablations, the paper makes a compelling case that CrossMax effectively navigates the open-set challenges intrinsic to sparse yet informative body pose sequences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a benchmark and novel method for open-set skeleton-based action recognition that achieves state-of-the-art performance by using cross-modality mean max discrepancy suppression during training and cross-modality distance-based logits refinement during testing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A large-scale benchmark for Open-Set Skeleton-based Action Recognition (OS-SAR), featuring three datasets for classification from body pose sequences, seven open-set recognition baselines, and three well-established backbones for skeleton data streams.

2. A multimodal approach for OS-SAR leveraging three streams - joints, velocities, and bones - and enabling the distribution-wise information exchange among them using the novel Cross-Modality Mean Max Discrepancy (CrossMMD) suppression mechanism.  

3. A distance-based confidence measure, the Channel Normalized Euclidean distance (CNE-distance), to address overconfidence in SoftMax-normalized probability estimates and enhance open-set recognition.

4. The complete CrossMax methodology that combines the aforementioned CrossMMD and the distance-based logits refinement technique, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various evaluations.

In summary, the main contribution is the formulation of a new benchmark and task of open-set skeleton-based action recognition, along with a novel method called CrossMax that achieves superior performance on this task across datasets and backbones.

The paper introduces a new benchmark and approach for open-set skeleton-based action recognition, which aims to detect novel or out-of-distribution actions beyond those seen during training. The key ideas include using multiple modalities derived from the skeleton data (joints, velocities, bones), aligning their distributions via the proposed CrossMMD method, and refining predictions based on nearest neighbor distances (CNE-distance). The complete approach is referred to as CrossMax. Experiments across diverse datasets and backbones demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in recognizing open sets for skeletal action streams.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel cross-modality mean max discrepancy (CrossMMD) mechanism. Can you explain in more detail how this works and how it enables better information exchange across modalities during training? 

2. The distance-based confidence measure CNE-distance is introduced. What are the key benefits of using a distance-based measure over a Softmax probability for open-set recognition? And why does CNE-distance alone perform worse than Softmax for closed-set classification?

3. The paper introduces a cross-modality distance-based logits refinement technique. Can you walk through this in more detail and explain how it balances open-set and closed-set performance? 

4. Three skeleton modalities are used - joints, velocities, bones. What is the intuition behind using multiple modalities? Does adding more modalities always help improve performance? What are the limitations?

5. How does the paper evaluate performance - which datasets, splits and metrics are used? And what do the results show in terms of cross-dataset/backbone generalizability of the method?

6. What modifications need to be made to adapt existing open-set image classification methods as baselines for the OS-SAR task? And why do you think they struggle to perform well?

7. The paper identifies overconfidence issues with Softmax probability estimates. Are there other weaknesses of existing open-set methods when applied to skeletal data? 

8. Could the proposed method be extended to use multiple skeleton streams from different camera views as separate modalities? What potential benefits or challenges would this introduce?

9. The runtime complexity will increase linearly with number of modalities. Are there ways to optimize CrossMMD and multi-stream processing to improve efficiency?

10. A limitation mentioned is increased memory usage due to ensembles. How else could the ideas in CrossMax be implemented without using ensembles to reduce memory overhead?
