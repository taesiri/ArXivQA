# [Navigating Open Set Scenarios for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the novel and unexplored problem of open-set skeleton-based action recognition (OS-SAR). In real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data. Using pure skeleton data poses challenges for recognizing novel actions due to lack of visual cues and the sparse structure of body poses. Existing open-set methods for images/videos struggle for OS-SAR and have inconsistent performance across datasets/backbones.

Method:
The paper proposes CrossMax, a multimodal approach using joints, velocities and bones. It utilizes a novel Cross-Modality Mean Maximum Discrepancy (CrossMMD) suppression method to align latent spaces and reduce modality disparities during training. For testing, a Channel Normalized Euclidean (CNE) distance to nearest training sample is proposed as open-set probability. While it performs well for open-set, CNE distance struggles for closed-set classification vs vanilla Softmax. Thus, a cross-modality distance-based logits refinement technique is introduced that combines averaged logits and CNE distances, separately refining salient vs non-salient positions.

Contributions:
1) A large-scale OS-SAR benchmark with 3 datasets, 7 open-set baselines and 3 skeleton-based backbones.

2) The CrossMMD method to enable information exchange among modalities by aligning distributions.  

3) The CNE distance for open-set probability estimation and distance-based logits refinement to balance open-set and closed-set performance.

4) State-of-the-art CrossMax approach that uses both CrossMMD and refinement, achieving superior and consistent OS-SAR results across evaluations.

The key novelty is handling open-set recognition for sparse skeleton streams by using cross-modality calibration and distance-based confidence estimation. The benchmark and models advance open-set analysis for pose-based action recognition.
