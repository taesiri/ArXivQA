# [On Invariance Penalties for Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09777v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop a more effective invariance penalty for the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) principle in order to improve out-of-distribution generalization. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel invariance penalty called IRMv2 as an alternative to the original penalty proposed by Arjovsky et al. (2019) for IRM. The paper argues that the original IRMv1 penalty can be arbitrarily small for non-invariant representations, as demonstrated by a counterexample from Rosenfeld et al. (2021). To address this limitation, the authors of this paper derive IRMv2 based on revisiting the structure of risk and show it is directly comparable to risk.The central hypothesis is that IRMv2 will be more effective than IRMv1 at recovering invariant representations and achieving out-of-distribution generalization across different environments, particularly in cases where IRMv1 fails. Theoretical results are provided to show IRMv2 can recover invariant representations in linear settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of IRMv2 compared to other IRM methods and baselines.In summary, the paper aims to improve IRM for domain generalization by proposing a new invariance penalty called IRMv2 that better captures invariance compared to the original IRMv1 penalty. The central hypothesis is that IRMv2 will lead to better out-of-distribution generalization performance.
