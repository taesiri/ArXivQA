# [Improving LLM Code Generation with Grammar Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate code but often produce syntactically incorrect outputs. This limits their reliability and adoption for code generation tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes SynCode, a framework to constrain LLM code generation to produce only syntactically valid code. 

- SynCode utilizes a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) representation of the grammar to compute a language model token mask. This mask filters the vocabulary to only tokens that can lead to syntactically valid code.

- An efficient incremental parsing algorithm is used to extract syntactic state from partial code for computing the DFA masks.

- SynCode guarantees that any code completion will be syntactically valid as long as the prompt and existing partial code are valid.

Main Contributions:

- Novel method to integrate formal grammars with neural language models to guarantee syntactic validity of generated code.

- Efficient incremental parsing algorithm that scales to large language models by storing parser states.

- Empirical evaluation showing SynCode eliminates >95% of syntax errors across multiple models and programming languages with no degradation in code quality.

- Demonstration of SynCode's effectiveness in few-shot prompting settings in addition to zero-shot.

In summary, SynCode enables reliably syntactically valid code generation from large language models by using formal grammars to constrain the models' vocabulary space during inference. The paper shows empirically significant improvements in syntactic correctness with no negative impacts on code quality.
