# [Low Frequency Sampling in Model Predictive Path Integral Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Sampling-based model predictive controllers like MPPI use Gaussian noise for exploration, but this can lead to high-frequency "chattery" controls that may exceed system bandwidth limitations or cause wear on hardware. 
- Gaussian samples also struggle to explore the edges of the state space or produce sustained extreme control values required for tight maneuvers with slow dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a colored noise distribution with tunable frequency characteristics for sampling in MPPI. This allows control of the frequency content and smoothness.
- Sample the colored noise in the frequency domain as independent Gaussians with variance that decays with frequency based on a tunable exponent Î³. Take the inverse FFT to get time-domain controls.
- Show the colored samples are Gaussian distributed in time. Derive MPPI update equations with colored sampling, requiring only small modifications. 

Contributions:
- Demonstrate much smoother throttle control on a quadcopter with similar performance to Gaussian MPPI. Allows operating at the limits of dynamics while avoiding chatter.
- Show improved exploration and ability to make tight sustained turns with an off-road vehicle that is unresponsive to high frequency controls. 
- Analysis on a double integrator shows the colored noise sampler achieves lower cost solutions with less control effort compared to other approaches while avoiding their oscillatory behavior.
- The tunable frequency sampling provides a general tool for model predictive control that can match system dynamics.

In summary, the paper introduces a colored noise model predictive control method to achieve smoother, more optimal controls across systems with different dynamic responsiveness, while improving state space exploration and avoiding control chatter issues. The frequency tuning is shown to generalize well across very different dynamical systems.
