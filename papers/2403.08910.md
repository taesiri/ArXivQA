# [Meta-operators for Enabling Parallel Planning Using Deep Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08910)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is growing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to AI planning for learning general policies. Typically, a one-to-one mapping is assumed between planning operators and RL actions. 
- This limits the perspectives that can be addressed, such as parallel planning where multiple actions are taken simultaneously. 
- Some planning domains like logistics and depots have achieved unsatisfactory outcomes using standard generalized planning models.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce the concept of "meta-operator" which combines multiple planning operators into one larger RL action. This enables parallel operator application within the sequential RL action space.
- Meta-operators are formed by simultaneously applying non-conflicting operators. The resulting meta-operator inherits the union of the component operators' preconditions, effects, etc.
- Meta-operators are added to the RL action space, allowing parallelism to be simulated during training. Small rewards for meta-operators also help with sparse rewards. 
- Evaluate meta-operators on tightly-coupled planning domains like logistics, depots and multi-blocksworld using generalized planning with deep RL.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of meta-operator to decouple the standard one-to-one mapping between planning operators and RL actions. This enables new perspectives like parallel planning to be studied with RL.
- Analysis showing improved coverage and reduced plan lengths when using meta-operators compared to sequential models in challenging planning domains.  
- Discussion of how meta-operators improve exploration, state space coverage, and collaboration between entities during RL training.
- Establishing the use of meta-operators as a way to better align RL action spaces with the true nature of planning problems.
