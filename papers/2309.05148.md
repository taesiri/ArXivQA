# [Beyond Skin Tone: A Multidimensional Measure of Apparent Skin Color](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05148)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a more comprehensive, multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images to better assess fairness and biases related to skin color in computer vision datasets and models?The key points are:- The commonly used Fitzpatrick skin type scale focuses only on skin tone from light to dark. This is limiting as apparent skin color has multiple dimensions like tone and hue. - The paper proposes using two quantitative metrics - perceptual lightness L* for skin tone, and hue angle h* for skin hue - to get a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images.- This multidimensional skin color measure is then used to:1) Reveal previously invisible biases related to both tone and hue in datasets like CelebA and FFHQ, and generative models trained on them.2) Show performance differences in saliency-based cropping and face verification models across skin tone and hue. 3) Demonstrate causal effects of skin color changes on attribute prediction, like classifying lighter tones as more feminine.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using a multidimensional skin color measure can uncover additional biases related to skin color compared to just using skin tone. The paper aims to demonstrate the relevance and effectiveness of this multidimensional approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color that goes beyond just skin tone. Specifically:- The paper introduces measuring both the perceptual lightness (L*) for skin tone and the hue angle (h*) for skin hue. This provides a more comprehensive way to quantify variations in apparent skin color compared to just using something like the Fitzpatrick scale that focuses only on skin tone. - The paper demonstrates the benefits of this multidimensional measurement by using it to reveal biases related to skin color in datasets and models. For example, it shows that common face datasets are skewed not only towards lighter skin tones but also towards redder skin hues. And it reveals that models can show biases along both skin tone and hue dimensions on tasks like classification and face verification.- Overall, the multidimensional skin color measurement allows for better understanding and characterization of biases related to skin color representation and performance in computer vision. The authors argue it offers a useful tool for fairness assessments during dataset curation and model development.In summary, the key contribution is moving beyond just skin tone to propose a more comprehensive quantification of apparent skin color variation using both lightness and hue. And showing how this multidimensional view enables revealing additional biases in datasets and models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes using a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color, including both skin tone and hue, to better quantify biases related to skin color in datasets and computer vision models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes a novel contribution to the field of skin color measurement and fairness in computer vision by proposing a multidimensional approach to quantifying apparent skin color. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:- Most prior work has focused only on skin tone (lightness/darkness) as a measure of skin color. This paper argues that hue is also an important dimension, capturing variation from red to yellow hues. Considering both tone and hue provides a more comprehensive representation of apparent skin color.- The paper builds on seminal work like Gender Shades by Buolamwini and Gebru that used the Fitzpatrick skin type scale to study bias in vision systems. However, it argues the Fitzpatrick scale is limiting due to focusing only on tone and problems with interpretation. The quantitative tone/hue measures proposed here aim to provide more objective measures.- Compared to work in dermatology/cosmetics measuring intrinsic skin color, this paper focuses on apparent skin color in images to evaluate vision system fairness. It proposes techniques to extract skin color scores from images rather than relying on specialized measurement devices.- The paper demonstrates the value of multidimensional skin color measurement through novel bias analyses. Skin hue is shown to reveal biases invisible to tone alone in datasets, generative models, cropping, verification, and attribute prediction.- Overall, this work makes both conceptual and technical contributions relative to prior art. Conceptually, it argues for and formalizes the idea of multidimensional skin color measurement for fairness. Technically, it provides methods to extract multidimensional scores from images and conducts novel bias studies. The multidisciplinary approach synthesizes computer vision, color science, and fairness research.In summary, while building on prior work, this paper extends the measurement and analysis of apparent skin color in important new directions to better recognize biases related to variation in skin colors. The novel multidimensional perspective provides value to the fields of computer vision and algorithmic fairness.
