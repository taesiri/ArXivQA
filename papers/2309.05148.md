# [Beyond Skin Tone: A Multidimensional Measure of Apparent Skin Color](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05148)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a more comprehensive, multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images to better assess fairness and biases related to skin color in computer vision datasets and models?

The key points are:

- The commonly used Fitzpatrick skin type scale focuses only on skin tone from light to dark. This is limiting as apparent skin color has multiple dimensions like tone and hue. 

- The paper proposes using two quantitative metrics - perceptual lightness L* for skin tone, and hue angle h* for skin hue - to get a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images.

- This multidimensional skin color measure is then used to:

1) Reveal previously invisible biases related to both tone and hue in datasets like CelebA and FFHQ, and generative models trained on them.

2) Show performance differences in saliency-based cropping and face verification models across skin tone and hue. 

3) Demonstrate causal effects of skin color changes on attribute prediction, like classifying lighter tones as more feminine.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using a multidimensional skin color measure can uncover additional biases related to skin color compared to just using skin tone. The paper aims to demonstrate the relevance and effectiveness of this multidimensional approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color that goes beyond just skin tone. Specifically:

- The paper introduces measuring both the perceptual lightness (L*) for skin tone and the hue angle (h*) for skin hue. This provides a more comprehensive way to quantify variations in apparent skin color compared to just using something like the Fitzpatrick scale that focuses only on skin tone. 

- The paper demonstrates the benefits of this multidimensional measurement by using it to reveal biases related to skin color in datasets and models. For example, it shows that common face datasets are skewed not only towards lighter skin tones but also towards redder skin hues. And it reveals that models can show biases along both skin tone and hue dimensions on tasks like classification and face verification.

- Overall, the multidimensional skin color measurement allows for better understanding and characterization of biases related to skin color representation and performance in computer vision. The authors argue it offers a useful tool for fairness assessments during dataset curation and model development.

In summary, the key contribution is moving beyond just skin tone to propose a more comprehensive quantification of apparent skin color variation using both lightness and hue. And showing how this multidimensional view enables revealing additional biases in datasets and models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color, including both skin tone and hue, to better quantify biases related to skin color in datasets and computer vision models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes a novel contribution to the field of skin color measurement and fairness in computer vision by proposing a multidimensional approach to quantifying apparent skin color. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:

- Most prior work has focused only on skin tone (lightness/darkness) as a measure of skin color. This paper argues that hue is also an important dimension, capturing variation from red to yellow hues. Considering both tone and hue provides a more comprehensive representation of apparent skin color.

- The paper builds on seminal work like Gender Shades by Buolamwini and Gebru that used the Fitzpatrick skin type scale to study bias in vision systems. However, it argues the Fitzpatrick scale is limiting due to focusing only on tone and problems with interpretation. The quantitative tone/hue measures proposed here aim to provide more objective measures.

- Compared to work in dermatology/cosmetics measuring intrinsic skin color, this paper focuses on apparent skin color in images to evaluate vision system fairness. It proposes techniques to extract skin color scores from images rather than relying on specialized measurement devices.

- The paper demonstrates the value of multidimensional skin color measurement through novel bias analyses. Skin hue is shown to reveal biases invisible to tone alone in datasets, generative models, cropping, verification, and attribute prediction.

- Overall, this work makes both conceptual and technical contributions relative to prior art. Conceptually, it argues for and formalizes the idea of multidimensional skin color measurement for fairness. Technically, it provides methods to extract multidimensional scores from images and conducts novel bias studies. The multidisciplinary approach synthesizes computer vision, color science, and fairness research.

In summary, while building on prior work, this paper extends the measurement and analysis of apparent skin color in important new directions to better recognize biases related to variation in skin colors. The novel multidimensional perspective provides value to the fields of computer vision and algorithmic fairness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more comprehensive and multidimensional measures of apparent skin color beyond just skin tone. The authors propose using perceptual lightness and hue angle as a first step, but suggest exploring additional dimensions as well. 

- Apply multidimensional skin color analysis to additional computer vision tasks beyond just face-related tasks. The authors mention this could be helpful for things like pose estimation, segmentation, etc.

- Use multidimensional skin color scores to help improve diversity in data collection processes. The scores could help ensure a balanced representation across different skin color subgroups.

- Leverage multidimensional skin color scores for fairness-aware model training. The scores could help identify which samples models struggle with and guide data augmentation or model debiasing techniques.

- Explore mitigating model biases related to skin color differences. Now that biases can be measured better, techniques like data augmentation, adversarial debiasing, contrastive learning etc. could be used to address them.

- Develop skin color measurements that are more robust to factors like illumination, makeup, pose etc. The paper discusses challenges in getting reliable skin color scores from in-the-wild images.

- Validate the skin color scoring methodology on more diverse datasets. Most of the analysis was on face datasets, so expanding to more datasets would be useful.

- Compare multidimensional skin color measures to other proposed scales like the Monk scale. See how they align and if combining scales could be beneficial.

So in summary, the authors lay out a research agenda for improving skin color measurement, using it to enhance diversity, revealing biases, mitigating biases, and developing more robust techniques. Their multidimensional analysis opens up many avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images to assess fairness beyond just skin tone. Instead of the commonly used Fitzpatrick scale that focuses only on tone ranging from light to dark, the authors propose also measuring the hue angle ranging from red to yellow. When applied to common computer vision datasets and models, measuring both tone and hue reveals additional biases related to skin color that were previously invisible. The paper shows the benefits of a multidimensional skin color scale through experiments on saliency cropping, face verification, and attribute prediction. Overall, the additional skin hue dimension provides novel insights into dataset and model biases, and the authors recommend adopting multidimensional skin color scores for more comprehensive fairness evaluations in computer vision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images to assess fairness in computer vision. Instead of only using skin tone on a scale from light to dark like prior work, the authors propose also measuring skin hue on a scale from red to yellow. They extract the perceptual lightness $L^*$ as a measure of skin tone, and the hue angle $h^*$ as a measure of skin hue from facial images. Using these two complementary scores, the paper analyzes the distribution of skin colors in common datasets like CelebA and FFHQ. Results show these datasets are skewed towards light skin tones and red hues. The paper also benchmarks computer vision models on tasks like cropping faces, face verification, and predicting attributes. Analyzing performance by both skin tone and hue reveals new biases related to skin color that are not visible looking at tone alone. For example, cropping prefers light red skin, while attribute classifiers label lighter skin as more feminine and redder skin as more smiley. Overall, the multidimensional skin color measure enables more comprehensive fairness evaluations of datasets and models.

In summary, this paper proposes measuring both skin tone and hue to better capture apparent skin color variations in images. Analyzing computer vision datasets and models along these two dimensions reveals new insights into skin color bias. The multidimensional skin color scale offers a useful tool for fairness assessments that goes beyond a one dimensional notion of skin tone.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a multidimensional approach to measure apparent skin color in images beyond just skin tone. They propose using the CIELAB color space to quantify skin color along two dimensions - perceptual lightness L* as a measure of skin tone from light to dark, and hue angle h* as a measure of skin hue from red to yellow. To extract these skin color scores from an image, they segment the skin pixels, convert them to CIELAB, cluster the pixels into groups, and then average the L* and h* values of the top 3 clusters by pixel size to get the final scalar scores representing skin tone and hue in the image. They apply this method to measure and reveal biases related to skin color in datasets like CelebA and FFHQ, as well as in models like image cropping, face verification, and attribute classification. The multidimensional scores enable them to uncover biases not just related to tone but also hue.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the issue of measuring apparent skin color in computer vision in a more comprehensive, multidimensional manner beyond just skin tone. The key questions it is trying to tackle are:

1. How can we quantify and measure apparent skin color in images in a way that captures more dimensions beyond just light/dark skin tone?

2. What are the benefits of using a multidimensional skin color scale for evaluating fairness and biases in computer vision datasets and models?

3. How does measuring both skin tone and skin hue reveal additional biases related to skin color that are not visible when just using a unidimensional skin tone scale?

The paper argues that the commonly used Fitzpatrick scale for skin tone, while practical, is limited because it only focuses on a one-dimensional scale of light to dark skin. It does not account for other dimensions of skin color variation like skin hue. So the paper introduces measuring both the perceptual lightness (L*) for skin tone and the hue angle (h*) for skin hue to better capture the multidimensionality of apparent skin color in images. 

The key goals are to demonstrate: (1) how this multidimensional skin color scale reveals previously invisible biases in datasets and models related to both tone and hue, and (2) why considering both tone and hue is important for comprehensively evaluating and addressing skin color biases in computer vision systems. Overall, it aims to promote better fairness benchmarking tools.
