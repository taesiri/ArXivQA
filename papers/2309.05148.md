# [Beyond Skin Tone: A Multidimensional Measure of Apparent Skin Color](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05148)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a more comprehensive, multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images to better assess fairness and biases related to skin color in computer vision datasets and models?The key points are:- The commonly used Fitzpatrick skin type scale focuses only on skin tone from light to dark. This is limiting as apparent skin color has multiple dimensions like tone and hue. - The paper proposes using two quantitative metrics - perceptual lightness L* for skin tone, and hue angle h* for skin hue - to get a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color in images.- This multidimensional skin color measure is then used to:1) Reveal previously invisible biases related to both tone and hue in datasets like CelebA and FFHQ, and generative models trained on them.2) Show performance differences in saliency-based cropping and face verification models across skin tone and hue. 3) Demonstrate causal effects of skin color changes on attribute prediction, like classifying lighter tones as more feminine.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using a multidimensional skin color measure can uncover additional biases related to skin color compared to just using skin tone. The paper aims to demonstrate the relevance and effectiveness of this multidimensional approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a multidimensional measure of apparent skin color that goes beyond just skin tone. Specifically:- The paper introduces measuring both the perceptual lightness (L*) for skin tone and the hue angle (h*) for skin hue. This provides a more comprehensive way to quantify variations in apparent skin color compared to just using something like the Fitzpatrick scale that focuses only on skin tone. - The paper demonstrates the benefits of this multidimensional measurement by using it to reveal biases related to skin color in datasets and models. For example, it shows that common face datasets are skewed not only towards lighter skin tones but also towards redder skin hues. And it reveals that models can show biases along both skin tone and hue dimensions on tasks like classification and face verification.- Overall, the multidimensional skin color measurement allows for better understanding and characterization of biases related to skin color representation and performance in computer vision. The authors argue it offers a useful tool for fairness assessments during dataset curation and model development.In summary, the key contribution is moving beyond just skin tone to propose a more comprehensive quantification of apparent skin color variation using both lightness and hue. And showing how this multidimensional view enables revealing additional biases in datasets and models.
