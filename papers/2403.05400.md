# [Safe Spot: Perceived safety of dominant and submissive appearances of   quadruped robots in human-robot interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quadruped robots like Spot are being increasingly adopted, but their social perception and acceptability remain poorly understood. 
- In particular, it is unknown whether and how the personality and behaviors displayed by the robot affect people's perceived safety, which is key for social acceptability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors designed and evaluated two personalities (dominant and submissive) for Spot, by manipulating its gait, height, arm position and gaze.  
- They tested the two personalities in a within-subjects user study with 21 participants, who interacted with the robot in two scenarios: head-on walking and crossing paths.
- Both behavioral metrics (proximity, crossing order) and subjective ratings of perceived safety were collected.

Key Findings:
- Participants felt significantly less safe with the dominant robot compared to the submissive one. The dominant robot was described as more intimidating, threatening and rude.
- There was no evidence that interaction dynamics changed based on robot personality. Humans still predominantly resolved interactions by walking around the robot.  
- Previous in-person experience with Spot slightly decreased subjective safety ratings, but did not affect behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- First evidence that a submissive vs dominant quadruped robot personality affects perceived safety, with implications for social acceptance.
- Highlights the need to consider individual perceptions and expectations when designing robot behaviors.
- Argues for importance of studying felt experiences in human-robot interactions beyond quantitative metrics.

Does this summary accurately capture the key points of the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The study found that people perceived a quadruped robot displaying submissive behaviors as safer compared to one displaying dominant behaviors, while interaction dynamics did not differ between behaviors and participants with previous in-person experience rated the robot as less safe.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is providing novel insights into the effects that specific features of quadruped robot behaviors (posture, gaze) have on the safety and comfort perceived by humans when walking in a constrained space with a co-present robot. In particular, the paper investigated how a dominant versus a submissive personality expressed through the robot's bodily postures affects people's perception of safety during accidental encounters with the robot. The key findings were that participants perceived the submissive robot as safer compared to the dominant one, while the behavioral dynamics of interactions did not change based on the robot's appearance. The paper argues these findings further contribute to knowledge on appearance-constrained robot communication and its implications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this research include:

- Quadruped robots - The paper focuses specifically on people's perception of and interactions with four-legged robots like Boston Dynamics' Spot.

- Perceived safety - A main concept explored is how safe or comfortable people feel when encountering and interacting with the quadruped robot under different conditions. 

- Dominant and submissive behaviors - Two distinct behavioral profiles are designed and compared, with the robot displaying either dominant (confident, upright) or submissive (cautious, crouched) postures and gaits.

- Embodied ideation - Performative methods like bodystorming are used to ideate and understand the design space of robot behaviors and their effects through embodied enactments.  

- Human-robot interaction - The research looks broadly at aspects of social acceptability, spatial navigation, proxemics, and communication relevant to humans encountering and interacting with robots in shared spaces.

- Mixed methods - The study combines both behavioral metrics (trajectories, distances, timings) and subjective questionnaires to evaluate the robot behaviors.

In summary, this paper explores the perceived safety and resulting acceptability of different quadruped robot behaviors using embodied design and HRI evaluation methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Research through Design approach combined with embodied ideation to design the robot behaviors. Can you expand more on the specifics of the embodied ideation process? What exercises or activities were involved? How long was the session and how many researchers participated?

2. In the bodystorming session, what specific insights came up regarding keeping the robot's speed and direction constant? What effects did acting this out have on the experience from the human perspective? 

3. For the dominant and submissive behaviors, what exact gait patterns and postures were selected for each? Were other options considered and tested through bodystorming? If so, why were they not chosen?

4. The paper states that gaze was an important aspect affecting perception of the robot. However, it seems gaze direction was not explicitly manipulated across conditions. Why not and would explicitly controlling gaze have provided additional insights?  

5. The paper discusses individual imaginaries and animal associations as important to understanding variations in perception. Did all participants make some kind of animal association and was this captured? If so, how did animal associations correlate to safety ratings?

6. Safety margins and conflict resolution times did not differ between conditions behaviorally. Did any other metrics show sensitivity to the manipulations, even non-significantly? What other proxemic or trajectory metrics could reveal further insights?

7. What informed the choice of a within-subjects experiment? Would a between-subjects study have been more appropriate to avoid bias from previous exposures? Why was only one robot used rather than having two robots with fixed personalities?

8. The paper highlights unpredictability and sudden movements as decreasing perceived safety for those with previous experience. Were metrics capturing predictability and movement smoothness analyzed in relation to experience? If not, how could this be quantified? 

9. The paper focuses on incidental encounters in a constrained lab setting. How well might the results generalize to real-world environments and applications? What steps could be taken to increase ecological validity? 

10. The sample lacks diversity and represents a tech-savvy population. What participant recruitment strategies could help involve a more representative population to understand a broader range of perspectives?
