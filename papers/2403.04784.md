# [Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Federated Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper studies the privacy threats in using Federated Learning (FL) to train Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, it focuses on analyzing the risks of membership inference attacks conducted by a dishonest central server. 

The paper first provides background on the increasing adoption of FL to address the challenges of training massive LLMs, which require substantial data and computing resources. It then discusses common modifications to FL that only update a subset of the model's parameters, known as parameter-efficient training (PET), to accommodate LLMs. However, the privacy implications of using these PET methods in FL remain unclear.

Motivated by this gap, the paper formally analyzes the privacy risks through an "active membership inference" threat model that involves a malicious server manipulating the trainable parameters to compromise users' data privacy. The main contributions are:

1) Proving that the server can perfectly infer membership information of users' data by exploiting the fully-connected layers in FL with PET. This is done by configuring the weights to activate a neuron if and only if a target data sample is present. 

2) Introducing a novel self-attention based attack that filters out the target sample and exploits the difference between a memorizing attention head and a non-memorizing one to achieve high attack success rates. Formal guarantees on the attack's efficacy are provided.

3) Demonstrating the practical privacy risks through implementations of the attacks on popular LLMs like BERT, RoBERTa and GPTs over real-world text datasets. The attacks are shown to be effective even when the data is protected by differential privacy mechanisms.

In summary, this paper provides an extensive analysis, both theoretically and empirically, of the significant privacy vulnerabilities that arise from using FL to train LLMs. The results underscore the need for substantial modifications to existing FL systems and protocols to enable more secure decentralized learning of large models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes privacy leakage in federated learning of large language models, both theoretically and empirically, by designing active membership inference attacks that exploit fully connected layers and attention mechanisms with provable high success rates, and demonstrates significant risks even under differential privacy defenses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proving that the server can exploit the FC layers to perfectly infer membership information of local training data (Theorem 1).

2. Introducing a self-attention-based AMI attack with a significantly high guarantee success rate and demonstrating a similar privacy risk as in the case of FC layers (Theorem 2). 

3. Demonstrating practical privacy risks of utilizing LLMs in FL to AMI through the implementations of the formulated adversaries. Experiments are conducted on five state-of-the-art LLMs on four different datasets. The privacy risks for both unprotected and differentially private protected data are evaluated.

So in summary, the main contributions are:

1) Theoretical analysis and guarantees for two new AMI attacks exploiting FC layers and attention mechanisms 

2) Practical demonstrations of privacy risks in federated learning with large language models, for both unprotected and differentially private data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two active membership inference attacks, FC-based and attention-based. How are these attacks tailored to exploit the architectures commonly used when training large language models with federated learning?

2. Theorem 1 shows that the FC-based attack can achieve perfect inference. What assumptions does this require and how plausible are they in practice when attacking federated learning for large language models? 

3. The attention-based attack relies on the separation of patterns in the embedded space. How does this property relate to the memorization capability of attention, and what does it imply about which embeddings might be most vulnerable? 

4. How does the choice of beta impact the behavior of the attention-based attack both theoretically and in the experiments? What tradeoffs are involved in setting its value?

5. The asymptotic behavior in Remarks 3 and 4 show the attacks approach 100% success for high dimensional data. Why does this occur, and what does it suggest about privacy risks as language models continue to scale up?

6. What differences did you notice between encoder-decoder models like GPT versus encoder-only models like BERT in terms of vulnerability to the attention-based attack? What might explain this?

7. How well did the theoretical guarantees for the attacks correspond to the actual experimental results? What gaps existed and what might account for them?

8. Did attacking different layers of the models impact the success rate of inference as expected? What anomalous results were observed related to this? 

9. How effective overall were the differentially private defenses analyzed? Did any patterns emerge across DP methods or language models regarding relative robustness?

10. What modifications could be made to federated learning protocols for large language models to prevent the vulnerabilities demonstrated by these attacks? What would need to be proven regarding their security?
