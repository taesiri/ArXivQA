# [Emergent World Models and Latent Variable Estimation in Chess-Playing   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
There has been debate on whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT genuinely develop an internal understanding of the world, or if their competence comes from simply memorizing patterns in text. The authors aimed to investigate this question by training a LLM on the complex but constrained domain of chess games, analyzing its internal representations, and testing if they correlated with meaningful concepts like board state and player skill.

Methods:
- The authors trained 8-layer and 16-layer GPT models on 16 million chess game transcripts from Lichess. The models were given no prior chess knowledge and trained purely on next character prediction.
- The 16-layer model achieved 64% win rate against Stockfish level 0, showing it learned strategic play despite no explicit supervision. It had 99.8% legal move rate.
- The authors trained linear probes to predict board square state and player Elo from the model's activations. The best probes achieved 99.6% square state accuracy and 90.5% Elo classification accuracy on a test set, demonstrating meaningful latent state representations. 
- Using the board state probes, they performed interventions by modifying the model's activations to delete pieces from its internal board. This boosted legal move rate from 41% to 92% on perturbed boards, validating the probe's effectiveness.
- They also intervened to increase and decrease model "skill" using Elo probes. This respectively boosted and sank win rates by up to 2.6x, further confirming the representations' validity.

Main Contributions:
- Showed a LLM can learn meaningful chess knowledge like rules, strategy and skill purely from character prediction. Nochess knowledge provided.
- Demonstrated interpretable internal representations of board state and player skill levels using linear probes.
- Validated these representations causally via successful interventions to modify model's chess ability and internal board.
- Extended prior work focused on synthetic game datasets. This uses real human games, showing world models can emerge from natural language.

In summary, the paper clearly evidenced LLMs developing rich world knowledge on complex games solely from language prediction. The probes and interventions provided insight into these emergent internal representations.
