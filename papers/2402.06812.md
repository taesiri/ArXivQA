# [A Kalman Filter Based Framework for Monitoring the Performance of   In-Hospital Mortality Prediction Models Over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating model performance over time is challenging when sample size and class distribution keeps changing in real-world scenarios. Metrics like AUCROC and AUCPR are not directly comparable across different time periods.
- There is little control over number of samples and ratio of positive samples (class distribution) in real-world data. These are robustness factors that affect variance of metrics like AUCROC.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose adjusted performance metrics that account for sample size and class distribution changes to enable fair comparison across time. 
- Use a Kalman filter framework to estimate the mean performance metric over time. The variance is extrapolated in a sample size/positive ratio adjusted way.
- Use variance upper bound adjusted for sample size and positive ratio when number of positive cases is very low, instead of sample variance.

Contributions:
- Identify dominant factors, sensitive factors and robustness factors that explain performance changes over time.
- Layered model for performance change analysis over time.
- Kalman filter framework to estimate model performance by adjusting for shifts in sample size and class distribution. 
- Method to handle extremely skewed distributions by using variance upper bound.
- Demonstrate efficacy on synthetic data and apply retrospectively to COVID mortality prediction model showing stable performance despite operational changes.

In summary, the paper proposes a way to fairly compare model performance over time by accounting for changes in sample size and class imbalance. A Kalman filter method provides a robust estimate of performance metrics by extrapolating the variance. The method is shown to work on synthetic and real-world COVID patient data.
