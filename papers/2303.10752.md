# [Fully Self-Supervised Depth Estimation from Defocus Clue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10752)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research question this paper tries to address is: 

How can we do depth estimation from defocus/focal stacks in a completely self-supervised manner, without requiring ground truth depth or all-in-focus (AIF) images during training?

The paper proposes a novel framework to tackle this challenging problem. The key aspects are:

1. The paper argues that current depth-from-defocus (DFD) methods rely on having ground truth depth or AIF images during training, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where such supervision is not available. 

2. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a completely self-supervised framework that only requires a sparse focal stack as input during training.

3. The framework consists of a neural network (DAIF-Net) to predict depth and AIF image from the focal stack. The predictions are used to reconstruct the input stack via an optical model.

4. By enforcing consistency between the reconstructed and original input stacks, the framework provides supervision to train the DAIF-Net in a completely self-supervised manner, without needing ground truth depth or AIF images.

5. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised framework achieves results on par with supervised state-of-the-art DFD methods, while removing the need for ground truth supervision.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that depth and AIF image can be learned in a completely self-supervised manner from focal stacks alone, via an appropriate neural architecture and consistency-based supervisory signal. The paper aims to demonstrate this hypothesis through the proposed framework and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a more realistic and challenging scenario for depth-from-defocus (DFD) tasks, where only sparse focal stacks are available for training and testing, without ground truth depth or all-in-focus (AIF) images. 

2. It develops the first completely self-supervised framework for DFD, consisting of a DAIF-Net to predict depth and AIF images from focal stacks, and an optical model to reconstruct focal stacks for supervision.

3. It achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods on synthetic and real datasets, providing a strong baseline for future self-supervised DFD research.

In summary, the key novelty is the self-supervised framework that can train a DFD model using only sparse real focal stacks, removing requirements for ground truth depth or AIF images. This advances DFD research towards more practical real-world application.
