# [Continuous Sign Language Recognition Based on Motor attention mechanism   and frame-level Self-distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) is challenging as most methods focus only on static frame-level features from video sequences, ignoring dynamic changes between frames which provide important cues (facial expressions, head/body movements etc). 

Solution:
- Proposes a novel Motor Attention Mechanism (MAM) module to capture distorted changes in local motion regions during sign language expression and obtain a dynamic representation of image changes.

- Also applies self-distillation method at frame-level feature extraction for the first time in CSLR. This allows higher-order features to guide lower-order ones, improving feature expression without increased computations.

- Combines MAM and frame-level self-distillation into a holistic CSLR model called MAM-FSD.

Contributions:
- Proposes a new MAM module to make model focus more on dynamic changes between frames and enhance motion information.

- Introduces frame-level self-distillation to CSLR which improves feature representation capabilities without increased resources. 

- Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on 3 large-scale CSLR datasets with MAM-FSD using RGB inputs only.

- Provides visualization showing MAM focuses more on motion regions (hands, face etc.) which overlap with main sign language action areas.

- Performs comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrating advantages over other methods and validating the effectiveness of each component.

In summary, the key innovation is using MAM and frame-level self-distillation specifically designed for CSLR challenges to capture crucial dynamic cues between frames and better utilize features, outperforming previous approaches.
