# [Scalable Federated Unlearning via Isolated and Coded Sharding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model across distributed clients without sharing their local private data. However, the trained global model still contains some data information from the clients. To fully erase the data effects of specific clients from the global model, federated unlearning has emerged. But existing federated unlearning solutions like FedEraser suffer from extensive storage overhead and high computational cost, limiting their scalability in practice.

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes a scalable federated unlearning framework to efficiently remove the data effects of specific clients while maintaining high model accuracy. The key ideas are:

1) Stage-based Isolated Sharding: Clients are divided into multiple isolated shards. Upon unlearning requests, only the affected shards calibrate their local models to remove data effects, reducing affected clients. This significantly reduces expected retraining time for both sequential and concurrent unlearning requests.

2) Coded Computing-based Sharding: Intermediate model updates from clients are encoded into slices and distributed across clients. Servers later decode these slices for efficient unlearning. This improves storage efficiency by $(1-2\mu)C$ and throughput by $S/O(C^2 \log^2 C \log \log C)$, where $C$ is number of clients, $\mu$ is error tolerance and $S$ is number of shards.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a scalable federated unlearning framework to reduce retraining cost and storage overhead while preserving accuracy.

- Introduces stage-based isolated sharding to reduce affected clients upon unlearning requests, with theoretical analysis of time efficiency gains. 

- Develops a coded computing mechanism to improve system scalability in terms of storage efficiency and throughput.

- Experiments on image classification and text generation tasks demonstrate proposed framework reduces ≥65\% retraining time and ≥98\% storage overhead over state-of-the-art solutions while achieving comparable accuracy.

In summary, this paper makes the federated unlearning process much more efficient and scalable via isolated and coded sharding techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a scalable federated unlearning framework based on isolated sharding and coded computing to efficiently remove client data effects from trained models while reducing retraining time and storage overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a stage-based isolated sharding mechanism to reduce the number of affected clients for federated unlearning. Theoretical analysis shows that this can significantly reduce the expected time cost for processing both sequential and concurrent unlearning requests. 

2) Designing a coded computing-based sharding mechanism to improve system scalability. Specifically, it can improve the storage efficiency by $(1-2\mu)C$ and the throughput by $S/O(C^2 \log^2 C \log \log C)$, where $C$ is the number of clients, $\mu$ is the error tolerance, and $S$ is the number of shards.

3) Experiment results demonstrating that the proposed framework can reduce at least 65\% retraining time and 98\% storage overhead compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while achieving comparable unlearning effectiveness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and scalable federated unlearning framework based on isolated and coded sharding mechanisms, which is demonstrated to outperform existing methods.
