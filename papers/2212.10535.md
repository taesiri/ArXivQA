The authors survey several recent datasets and methods based on ITPs.- The paper discusses combining informal and formal theorem proving. Most prior work focused just on one or the other. The authors describe recent work on translating between informal statements/proofs and formal ones. This could combine the naturalness of informal proving with the rigor of formal methods.- The survey covers various techniques for training neural models for theorem proving, including recent uses of large language models. It provides an overview of methods like premise selection, proof step generation, and end-to-end proof generation.- The paper summarizes key resources like benchmark datasets and interactive environments. This provides a helpful guide to data sources for future research.- The scope is quite broad, covering both formal and informal proving, connections between them, neural network methods, datasets, and more. This provides a comprehensive overview.In summary, this survey offers a thorough synthesis of recent work at the intersection of deep learning and theorem proving. It highlights growing connections between informal and formal methods, applications of large language models, and diverse datasets and techniques. The broad scope and focus on interactive theorem proving differentiate it from prior surveys.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:- Developing methods to translate informal mathematical statements and proofs into formal versions. The authors mention the work by Wu et al. (2022) on autoformalization of informal statements, and Jiang et al. (2022) who created a version of the miniF2F benchmark with informal proofs. Translating between informal and formal representations of math could combine the advantages of both styles.- Exploring ways to enhance the robustness, generalization, and consistency of neural models for mathematical reasoning. The authors discuss limitations like struggling with large numbers, and being inconsistent across minor variations in problem statements. Improving these abilities is critical for real-world application.- Incorporating additional modalities beyond text, such as tables, diagrams, and images. The authors mention the growing interest in multi-modal math problems, but limitations of current datasets and models. Expanding to handle real-world situations may require interpreting multiple modalities.- Developing methods for more trustworthy and explainable reasoning. The authors suggest ideas like having models provide evidence for conclusions, making judgments about their own uncertainty, and detecting flaws in reasoning. Enhancing interpretability is key for practical use.- Enabling learning from feedback. The authors propose using techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback to iteratively improve reasoning through interaction. Active learning could make systems more robust and aligned.- Generalization to low-resource domains. The authors discuss initial work on non-English languages and specialized fields like finance and science. But much more research is needed to handle the diversity of real mathematical reasoning.In summary, key directions are enhancing robustness and generalization, expanding to more modalities and domains, improving interpretability, incorporating interaction, and combining informal and formal reasoning. Advances in these areas could move toward more capable and trustworthy automated reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents NaturalProofs, a large-scale dataset of 32,000 informal mathematical theorems, definitions, and proofs written in natural language and LaTeX syntax. The goal is to facilitate research on neural-network driven automated reasoning for informal theorem proving. The dataset consists of mathematical statements collected from arxiv.org papers in mathematics and computer science, along with proofs generated by an automated ITP system called Lean. Benchmark tasks are proposed for evaluating premise selection methods via retrieval and ranking, as well as proof generation methods via a new human evaluation protocol and proxy automatic metrics. Experiments demonstrate strong performance of Transformer models fine-tuned on NaturalProofs for premise selection compared to Information Retrieval baselines. The paper helps connect formal and informal theorem proving and provides an important new resource to make progress on automated mathematical reasoning in natural mathematical language.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper on theorem proving:The paper discusses recent advances in using deep learning and neural networks for automated theorem proving. Theorem proving is the task of demonstrating the truth of a mathematical statement (theorem) through logical arguments (a proof). The paper focuses on theorem proving using interactive theorem provers (ITPs) like Lean, Isabelle, and Coq. In ITPs, proofs are constructed interactively in a formal programming language and verified correct. Datasets for training neural models come from libraries of human-written ITP proofs and interactive ITP environments. Recent work trains neural language models to generate proof steps using datasets like LeanStep and CoqGym. The paper also discusses informal theorem proving, where proofs use a mix of natural language and symbols. Approaches include selecting premises for informal proofs and generating informal proofs. Emerging work combines informal and formal proving, such as translating informal proofs to formal proofs.In summary, the paper surveys recent advances at the intersection of deep learning and theorem proving. It focuses on formal proving using ITPs and datasets of human ITP proofs. It also covers informal proving and combinations of formal and informal proving. The overall goal is developing neural network models that can automate parts of the theorem proving process by learning from libraries of human proofs and interactions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new approach for automated theorem proving using large language models. The key idea is to leverage informal natural language proofs as a stepping stone towards generating formal proofs. The authors create a new version of the miniF2F benchmark by augmenting it with natural language statements and proofs, referred to as miniF2F+informal. They first explore using the GPT-3 model to generate informal proof sketches given informal statements. The informal proofs are then translated into the Lean formal proof language using a rule-based algorithm. Finally, the formal proof candidates are validated using the Lean proof assistant. By decomposing the difficult formal proving task into natural language proof generation and rule-based translation steps, the authors are able to achieve better performance on the miniF2F benchmark compared to prior work. This demonstrates the potential of large language models for automated theorem proving when combined with an autoformalization approach.
