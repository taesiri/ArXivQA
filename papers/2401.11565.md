# [Thompson Sampling for Stochastic Bandits with Noisy Contexts: An   Information-Theoretic Regret Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies a stochastic contextual bandit problem where the agent observes a noisy, corrupted version of the true context through an unknown noise channel. The goal is to design an action policy that can approximate the policy of an oracle that has access to the reward model, noise channel parameter, and predictive distribution of the true context. 

Proposed Solution:
- A Thompson sampling algorithm is proposed for Gaussian bandits with Gaussian context noise. 
- The algorithm incorporates a denoising step to obtain a predictive posterior distribution of the true context based on past observed noisy contexts. This distribution is used to select actions.
- The analysis shows the Bayesian regret of the algorithm compared to the oracle's policy is $O(d\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the context dimension and $T$ is the time horizon.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a Thompson sampling algorithm that can handle noisy contexts through an additional denoising step.
- Information-theoretic Bayesian regret analysis demonstrating the proposed algorithm approximates the oracle's policy.
- Extension to a setting with delayed true context observations, showing delayed contexts further reduce regret.  
- Empirical demonstration of the proposed algorithm against baselines on synthetic data.

The key innovation is in developing a Bayesian Thompson sampling algorithm tailored to noisy contexts and providing theoretical regret guarantees. The information-theoretic analysis is also novel, leveraging tools like conditional mutual information to account for the effect of noise. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of learning with additional denoising under noisy contexts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Thompson sampling algorithm with a denoising step for stochastic contextual bandits with Gaussian noise in the context, and provides an information-theoretic Bayesian regret analysis showing the regret scales as $O(d\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the context dimension and $T$ is the time horizon.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a novel Thompson sampling algorithm for stochastic contextual bandits where the agent observes a noisy, corrupted version of the true context through an unknown noise channel. Specifically, it considers a Bayesian setting with Gaussian bandits and Gaussian context noise.

2. It provides an information-theoretic analysis of the Bayesian regret of the proposed Thompson sampling algorithm compared to an oracle that has access to the true context as well as the noise channel parameters. It shows that the Bayesian regret scales as O(dâˆšT) where d is the context dimension and T is the time horizon. 

3. It extends the problem to a setting where the agent observes the true context with some delay after receiving the reward. It shows that delayed true contexts lead to lower Bayesian regret compared to never observing the true context.

4. It validates the proposed algorithms empirically and shows that they achieve robust performance even under high context noise levels, comparable to the best achievable performance when noise parameters are known.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of a Thompson sampling algorithm for noisy contextual bandits using an information-theoretic approach in a Bayesian setting. The regret analysis and extension to delayed contexts setting are also notable contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper:

- Stochastic contextual bandits
- Noisy contexts
- Thompson sampling 
- Information-theoretic regret analysis
- Bayesian regret
- Gaussian bandits
- Gaussian context noise
- Predictive posterior distribution
- Denoising 
- Delayed true contexts

The paper explores a stochastic contextual bandit problem where the agent only observes noisy or corrupted versions of the true context. It introduces a Thompson sampling algorithm for this setting in the case of Gaussian bandits and Gaussian context noise. A key contribution is the information-theoretic analysis bounding the Bayesian regret of the algorithm. Other key ideas include using past noisy contexts to predict the true context via a denoising step and analyzing the setting where true contexts are revealed after a delay. The Bayesian regret with respect to an oracle policy and algorithms able to leverage delayed true contexts are also central concepts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a Thompson sampling algorithm for noisy contextual bandits. How does the proposed algorithm differ from standard Thompson sampling, and what modifications were necessary to handle the noisy contexts?

2. A key aspect of the proposed method is the additional denoising step incorporated in each round. Explain the purpose and workings of this denoising step. What information does it aim to recover?  

3. The denoising step estimates a predictive distribution over the true contexts based on past observations. Walk through the derivations involved in estimating this predictive distribution under the Gaussian noise assumptions made in Sections 3.1 and 4.1.

4. The analysis of the proposed algorithm relies heavily on information-theoretic tools. Explain the high-level approach based on decomposing the Bayesian regret and bounding each term. What is the intuition behind using mutual information to quantify the estimation error?

5. Theorem 1 provides a Bayesian regret bound for the setting with delayed true contexts. Derive this result step-by-step starting from the regret decomposition in Equation 6. What are the key lemmas involved?  

6. How does the regret analysis change when true contexts are never observed by the agent (Section 5)? What additional complications arise and how are they addressed?

7. Lemma 3 provides an upper bound on the posterior mismatch between the true posterior and approximate posterior distribution used for sampling. Explain the origin of this mismatch and walk through the proof of the upper bound. 

8. The linear feature map assumption is pivotal for obtaining tighter bounds on the estimation error (Lemma 4). Justify why this assumption enables explicitly evaluating the mutual information terms.

9. The paper shows improved regret guarantees when true contexts are revealed after a delay. Intuitively explain why regret should be lower in this setting. What changes in the algorithm and analysis?

10. The numerical experiments focus only on synthetic data. What additional experiments would you suggest to better assess performance? What real-world datasets could be suitable for evaluating the proposed approach?
