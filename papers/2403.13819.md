# [A machine learning approach to predict university enrolment choices   through students' high school background in Italy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates gender disparities in university enrollment choices in Italy, particularly focusing on underrepresentation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programs. It examines the complex interplay between students' prior academic achievement, gender and high school background in influencing enrollment decisions.  

Methods:
The study utilizes a linked dataset tracing students from final year of high school to university enrollment. Machine learning methods, specifically gradient boosting models, are employed to analyze these educational pathways. The predictive models account for factors like performance in standardized tests, high school curriculum, school socioeconomic status and demographics. Advanced model interpretation techniques visualize estimated probabilities and importance of predictors.

Key Findings:  
- Performance in both mathematics and Italian language tests are most influential factors predicting university enrollment, with mathematics being more impactful for STEM choices.

- Socioeconomic status of high school attenuates in influence at very high levels. 

- Males in applied sciences high schools with strong mathematics skills show highest STEM enrollment probability.  

- Females require consistently higher academic ability than male peers to pursue STEM fields across high school curricula.

- Gender gaps in STEM enrollment conditional on academic ability are wider for applied sciences students.

- Humanities students exhibit lowest STEM enrollment probabilities, especially females.

Implications:
- Tailoring educational pathways based on subject strengths essential for channeling students.

- Targeted interventions combating stereotypes and gender biases necessary.

- Findings underscore need for intersectional approaches accounting for interconnections between gender, academic ability and backgrounds.

The paper highlights the nuanced gender discrepancies in educational choices shaped by influences like specialization and performance in high school. It argues for policies supporting inclusion and diversity.
