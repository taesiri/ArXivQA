# [Predictive Linear Online Tracking for Unknown Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the problem of online tracking control for unknown and non-stationary targets in linear control systems. Specifically, the goal is to control a linear dynamical system to track a target trajectory that is generated by an unknown exogenous linear dynamical system and revealed sequentially over time. This fits the framework of online non-stochastic control. The performance metric used is dynamic regret, which compares the total cost incurred by the online tracking controller versus the total cost of an optimal non-causal controller that knows the full target trajectory ahead of time. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an algorithm called Predictive Linear Online Tracking (PLOT) based on an indirect adaptive control approach. PLOT has two main components:

1. Target Prediction: Uses a modified recursive least squares (RLS) method with exponential forgetting to learn a time-varying dynamic model of the unknown target system. The learned model is then used to predict the target trajectory over a horizon. A key contribution here is adapting RLS to the case of delayed feedback that arises from multi-step ahead prediction.

2. Receding Horizon Control: The predicted target trajectory is used in a certainty equivalent model predictive control formulation to compute the control actions. The control policy structure matches the optimal non-causal controller, with the difference being that the feedforward terms use predicted instead of actual target states.

By decoupling prediction from control, the approach provides flexibility in tuning the prediction horizon and adaptation rate.

Main Contributions:
- Proof that the dynamic regret of PLOT scales as O(sqrt(TV_T)) where TV_T is the total variation in the unknown target dynamics. This bound is tighter than prior work that depends on variation of target state.
- Adaptation of RLS for prediction of time-varying multi-step ahead vector autoregressive systems. 
- One of the first demonstrations of online non-stochastic control methods on actual hardware by implementing PLOT on Crazyflie drones.
- Open-source implementation to facilitate future research.

In summary, the paper provides an indirectly adaptive tracking controller together with dynamic regret analysis and experimental validation for the problem of controlling linear systems to track unknown, non-stationary target trajectories.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new algorithm called predictive linear online tracking (PLOT) for online tracking of unknown time-varying targets in linear quadratic control problems, and proves a dynamic regret bound that scales with the square root of the total variation of the target dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new algorithm called predictive linear online tracking (PLOT) for tracking unknown and time-varying reference trajectories in linear quadratic control problems. The main contributions are:

1) PLOT uses a modified recursive least squares algorithm with forgetting factors to learn a time-varying dynamic model of the unknown target trajectory. This learned model is then used to make multi-step ahead predictions of the target state.

2) PLOT uses the predictions in a receding horizon control framework to compute the control actions. This allows it to track unknown and time-varying targets.

3) The paper provides dynamic regret analysis for PLOT, showing that it scales as O(sqrt(TV_T)) where V_T is the total variation of the target dynamics. This bound is sharper than prior work that depends on the target state variation.

4) PLOT is demonstrated in simulations and also implemented on real Crazyflie drones, making it one of the first successful applications of online control methods on hardware.

In summary, the main contribution is the PLOT algorithm along with its dynamic regret analysis and experimental validation for online tracking of unknown time-varying targets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an algorithm called Predictive Linear Online Tracking (PLOT) for online tracking of unknown time-varying targets. How does PLOT balance exploiting structural assumptions about the target dynamics (through an autoregressive model) and exploring unknown parts of the dynamics (through forgetting)?

2. PLOT uses a modified recursive least squares (RLS) method with exponential forgetting to learn a time-varying dynamic model of the target. How does the forgetting factor help the algorithm adapt to changes in the target dynamics? What are the tradeoffs in tuning this parameter?

3. The paper analyzes the dynamic regret of PLOT and shows it scales with the square root of the total variation of the target dynamics. What specific mathematical techniques are used to prove this result and why is it an improvement over prior dynamic regret bounds? 

4. PLOT is based on a certainty equivalence principle where an internal target model is used to compute optimal control actions. What are the pros and cons of this indirect approach compared to direct adaptive control methods?

5. The algorithm uses multiple independent RLS learners to deal with delayed learning feedback for multi-step ahead prediction. How does this approach compare to using a single learner with longer delays? What effect does it have on the regret analysis?

6. The experimental results showcase PLOT outperforming other online learning algorithms on a complex time-varying target trajectory. What specific properties of PLOT lead to improved performance in this case? How do the other methods fall short?

7. The paper demonstrates PLOT on actual Crazyflie drones, which is rare for online learning algorithms. What additional challenges arise in hardware experiments compared to simulations and how does the paper address them?

8. How does the receding horizon control framework used in PLOT balance computational complexity and tracking performance? What role does the prediction horizon play?

9. What modifications would be needed to apply PLOT to nonlinear systems? What new theoretical results would need to be developed?

10. The dynamic regret bound for PLOT has an unfavorable dependence on the dimensionality of the target state. What techniques could help reduce this dependence and enable scaling to higher-dimensional tracking tasks?
