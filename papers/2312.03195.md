# [Detecting Rumor Veracity with Only Textual Information by Double-Channel   Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03195)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel double-channel structure to determine the ex-ante veracity of rumors on social media. The goal is to classify rumors into true, false or unverifiable categories using only the textual content. The model first divides rumors into "informed" (based on private information) and "uninformed" (no information basis) using a BERT-based certainty classifier. For informed rumors, a lie detection algorithm is applied to identify intentional distortions. For uninformed rumors, an agreement detection algorithm uses the stances of primary replies to gauge crowd wisdom. On the SemEval 2019 Task 7 dataset requiring ex-ante three-way rumor classification, this model achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.4027, outperforming all baselines and the second-place winner. A key contribution is demonstrating the effectiveness of a double-channel structure tailored to linguistically-motivated rumor types. The textual-only approach also enables potential application to anonymous rumors. Overall, this work advances automated ex-ante rumor verification through selective algorithm application based on an informed/uninformed dichotomy.
