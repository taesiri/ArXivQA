# [Unsupervised Multilingual Dense Retrieval via Generative Pseudo Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multilingual information retrieval (mIR) aims to retrieve relevant documents from a collection in multiple languages given a query. 
- Dense retrieval methods that encode queries and documents into dense vectors have shown promise for mIR.
- However, training dense retrievers requires substantial paired data (query-document pairs), which is even more challenging to obtain for multilingual scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an unsupervised framework called UMR to train multilingual dense retrievers without needing any paired training data. 
- It has two main stages - unsupervised reranking using a multilingual language model (MLM) to get pseudo-labels, and knowledge distillation to train the dense retriever.
- The MLM leverages its generative capabilities to estimate the relevance between queries and retrieved documents for reranking.
- The reranker acts as the teacher to distill knowledge into the student retriever model through KL divergence loss.  
- There is also an iterative training process to continuously improve the retriever.

Main Contributions:
- First work to propose training multilingual dense retrievers in a completely unsupervised manner without needing any paired training data.
- Achieves comparable or better performance than supervised baselines on XOR-Retrieve and XOR-Full benchmarks.
- Detailed analysis provided to demonstrate the impact of different components of the framework.
- Showcases the potential of unsupervised learning to alleviate the annotation requirements for multilingual retrieval.

In summary, the paper introduces an unsupervised two-stage approach using MLMs and knowledge distillation to effectively train multilingual dense retrievers without paired training data. The experiments and analysis demonstrate its capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised method called UMR for training multilingual dense retrievers without any paired data by leveraging sequence likelihood estimation capabilities of pre-trained multilingual language models to obtain pseudo labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as:

1. The authors propose UMR, the first unsupervised method for training multilingual dense retrievers without any paired data. UMR leverages the sequence likelihood estimation capabilities of pretrained multilingual language models to obtain pseudo labels for training.

2. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, XOR-Retrieve and XOR-Full, show that the proposed UMR method performs comparable to or even outperforms strong supervised baselines. 

3. The paper presents detailed analysis to justify the effectiveness of individual components in the proposed UMR framework. The ablation studies analyze the impact of factors like unsupervised reranking, in-batch negatives, temperature, etc.

In summary, the key contribution is an unsupervised training framework for multilingual dense retrieval that eliminates the need for expensive paired training data. The experiments demonstrate the potential of this direction by showing performance on par or better than supervised methods on standard benchmarks. The analyses also provide insights into the working of different components.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the unsupervised multilingual dense retrieval method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative training approach with two stages. Can you explain the motivation behind this iterative approach and how it helps prevent overfitting? 

2. Unsupervised multilingual reranking is performed in the first stage. What is the intuition behind using the generative capabilities of multilingual LMs for relevance estimation? How does the negative log likelihood indicate relevance?

3. Why does the paper use KL divergence loss instead of converting rankings to hard labels during knowledge distillation? What are the potential benefits of preserving fine-grained scores?

4. The paper shows unsupervised question generation performs poorly. What are some potential reasons for this? How can unsupervised multilingual question generation be improved? 

5. What could explain why in-batch negatives have less impact compared to supervised methods? Does preserving fine-grained scores in the training process relate to this?

6. Batch size is shown to significantly impact performance. Why is a large batch size crucial for training dense retrievers? What role do in-batch negatives play in this?

7. How does temperature affect the knowledge distillation process? Why does a higher temperature degrade performance? 

8. The paper shows retrieval performance lags behind QA performance. What factors could contribute to this gap? How can improving the reranking stage address this?

9. What are some ways the proposed method could be extended to unseen or low-resource languages? What techniques could improve applicability across diverse languages?

10. What bound does the reranking performance pose on the overall framework? How can future work aim to improve the reranking capabilities using large language models?
