# [Learning Discrete Representations via Constrained Clustering for   Effective and Efficient Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05789)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to jointly learn discrete representations for document embeddings to enable efficient dense retrieval without significantly hurting ranking effectiveness?

The authors propose a novel model called RepCONC to tackle this challenge. The key ideas include:

1) Modeling quantization as constrained clustering during joint training of dual encoders and quantization methods like product quantization (PQ). 

2) Introducing a uniform clustering constraint to require document embeddings to be equally quantized to all centroids. This helps produce more balanced and distinguishable discrete codes compared to unconstrained clustering.

3) Approximating the computation of the uniform clustering constraint as an optimal transport problem for efficiency.

4) Employing inverted file system on top of PQ to enable fast approximate nearest neighbor search on CPUs. 

By jointly optimizing the discrete codes and encoders under the constrained clustering framework, RepCONC aims to achieve substantially higher efficiency in memory and computation time while preserving the ranking effectiveness of dense retrieval models. Experiments on two standard ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of RepCONC over both vector quantization baselines and a wide range of retrieval models.

In summary, the core focus is on developing a constrained clustering approach to learn efficient yet effective discrete representations for dense retrieval. Both the theoretical modeling and empirical results try to demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing efficiency and accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes RepCONC, a novel retrieval model that jointly learns discrete representations and dual-encoders for dense retrieval. RepCONC models quantization as constrained clustering to enable end-to-end optimization of Product Quantization parameters and dual-encoders. 

2. It introduces a uniform clustering constraint during training to require document embeddings to be equally quantized to all centroids. This helps tackle the issue of unbalanced clustering distribution and indistinguishable discrete codes. The constraint is approximately solved as an optimal transport problem.

3. It integrates inverted file system into RepCONC to enable efficient vector search on CPUs. 

4. Through experiments on two retrieval benchmarks, it demonstrates RepCONC's advantages over competitive baselines in terms of retrieval effectiveness, memory efficiency, and time efficiency. The ablation study shows the effectiveness of constrained clustering.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing constrained clustering for end-to-end learning of efficient and effective dense representations. The uniform clustering constraint and its connection to optimal transport are novel. Integrating inverted file system also enables efficient search on CPUs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents RepCONC, a new retrieval model that jointly trains dual-encoders and Product Quantization to learn discrete document representations that enable efficient nearest neighbor search through constrained clustering optimization and inverted indexes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents RepCONC, a new dense retrieval model that learns discrete representations of documents via constrained clustering. Here is a summary of how it compares to related work:

- Most existing dense retrieval models use brute-force search over uncompressed embeddings, which is inefficient in memory and computation. RepCONC jointly optimizes dual-encoders and product quantization to enable compressed document representations and fast approximate nearest neighbor search. This allows more efficient retrieval compared to models like ANCE, RepBERT, etc.

- Some recent work has also explored learning compressed representations, like JPQ and DPQ. However, RepCONC introduces a novel constrained clustering approach during training to optimize the discrete codes, while prior methods use fixed codes or heuristics like batch k-means. Experiments show RepCONC outperforms these baselines.

- RepCONC also employs inverted indexing on top of product quantization for additional speedup. This enables very fast CPU-based search compared to uncompressed models that rely purely on GPUs. The two-stage retrieval enabled by RepCONC outperforms end-to-end models like COIL and ColBERT.

- The uniform clustering constraint and optimal transport solution used during training are unique contributions not explored in prior work. Ablations show these are critical to RepCONC's effectiveness.

In summary, RepCONC pushes state-of-the-art in dense retrieval by enabling much more efficient search without sacrificing accuracy. The constrained clustering approach and joint optimization framework appear novel and help the model surpass previous baselines. The work addresses a key limitation of dense retrieval and seems like an important advance for scalable and fast neural search.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring other constrained clustering methods besides the uniform clustering constraint proposed in this work. The authors note that uniformly clustering sub-vectors is an approximate solution for maximizing the distinguishability of discrete embeddings. They suggest exploring other constraints that could potentially lead to better distinguishable embeddings.

- Combining RepCONC with other non-exhaustive approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods besides inverted file systems. The authors mention possibly integrating RepCONC with methods like HNSW to further improve search efficiency.

- Training RepCONC using knowledge distillation instead of negative sampling. The authors note they used negative sampling for training in this work, but mention training via knowledge distillation as a potential direction.

- Applying RepCONC to other embedding-based retrieval tasks beyond ad-hoc retrieval. The authors demonstrate RepCONC on passage/document ranking, but the method could potentially benefit other tasks involving learned sparse/discrete embeddings.

- Exploring end-to-end training of RepCONC's components like the inverted file system. The authors use unsupervised clustering for the IVF currently - supervising this could further improve effectiveness.

- Analyzing the theoretical properties of the constrained clustering formulation. The authors provide some analysis, but further theoretical study of RepCONC's constrained optimization could provide more insights.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring other constrained clustering methods, integrating RepCONC with other ANNS techniques, applying it to other tasks, and further theoretical analysis and end-to-end supervision of its components. Advancing these aspects could further improve RepCONC's efficiency and effectiveness.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new dense retrieval model called RepCONC that improves efficiency by learning discrete representations for document embeddings. The key idea is to jointly train the dual encoders and the product quantization method by modeling quantization as constrained clustering. Specifically, RepCONC utilizes a clustering loss to cluster document embeddings around quantization centroids.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes RepCONC, a dense retrieval model that learns discrete representations for document embeddings via constrained clustering. RepCONC jointly optimizes the dual-encoder networks and product quantization parameters used for vector compression. It models the quantization process as constrained clustering by introducing two components: 1) A clustering loss that clusters document embeddings around quantization centroids. 2) A uniform clustering constraint that requires document sub-vectors to be equally assigned to all centroids during training. This constraint is approximately enforced by formulating it as an optimal transport problem. By modeling quantization as constrained clustering, RepCONC is able to optimize the discrete codes jointly with the encoders in an end-to-end fashion. In addition, RepCONC employs inverted indexing to enable efficient approximate nearest neighbor search on CPUs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to improve the efficiency of dense retrieval (DR) models in terms of memory usage and computational time while maintaining high retrieval effectiveness. 

Some key issues with existing DR models that the paper highlights are:

- They require storing large dense vector indexes, which takes up a lot of memory. 

- They use brute-force nearest neighbor search over the dense vectors, which is computationally expensive. Many models have to use GPUs to accelerate this search.

- Existing methods like product quantization for compressing the vectors are unsupervised and hurt retrieval performance when applied to DR models.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new model called RepCONC that:

- Learns discrete representations of documents via a constrained clustering approach to enable compact storage and efficient search.

- Jointly optimizes the dual encoders used for query/doc embedding along with the product quantization method to maintain retrieval effectiveness. 

- Uses techniques like uniform clustering constraints and modeling quantization as a clustering problem to improve on prior work.

- Employs inverted indexing to further accelerate search without sacrificing too much effectiveness.

So in summary, the key focus is improving the efficiency of DR in terms of memory and computation time while preserving accuracy, which remains a challenge for existing models. RepCONC introduces novel techniques to optimize the discrete representations and search process towards this goal.
