# [An Internal Learning Approach to Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07957)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new video inpainting method based on internal learning. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to train a single frame-wise generative model to produce coherent video inpainting results by exploiting the internal statistics within a video, without relying on any external training data. 

Specifically, the key research questions explored in this paper are:

- Can a frame-wise generative model produce coherent video inpainting results when trained only on a single input video? 

- What are effective training strategies and loss functions to enable a generative model to capture spatial-temporal constraints for the video inpainting task through internal learning?

- How does jointly generating appearance and flow help enforce consistency during internal learning for video inpainting?

- How does this internal learning approach for video inpainting compare with existing methods that utilize external training data? What are its limitations and strengths?

In summary, this paper focuses on exploring the potential and limitations of internal learning for the challenging problem of video inpainting. It aims to demonstrate that, with proper training strategies, a single frame-wise generative model can produce surprisingly good results by exploiting internal statistics within a video, without relying on any external training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel video inpainting algorithm based on internal learning. The method extends the Deep Image Prior approach to video by training a generative convolutional neural network on an input video to fill in missing regions, without relying on any external training data.

2. Developing consistency-aware training strategies to address the key challenge of temporal consistency in video inpainting. The main idea is to jointly generate appearance frames and optical flow, and exploit the consistency between them during training. This helps propagate information across frames to achieve better coherence.

3. Demonstrating that a regular 2D CNN image generation model can produce high quality and temporally coherent video inpainting results when trained properly with the right objectives on the input video. The method performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art optimization or learning based video inpainting techniques.

4. Providing insights into internal learning for video generation tasks. The work explores appropriate network architectures, training methodologies, and shows the potential of video-specific internal learning over image-based models.

In summary, the key contribution is an in-depth study and novel framework exploring the idea of internal learning without external data for the challenging task of video inpainting. The method achieves strong results while only training on the individual input video.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video inpainting algorithm that jointly generates missing appearance and motion information without relying on external training data, instead using a convolutional neural network trained on the input video in an "internal learning" framework to exploit spatial-temporal redundancies within the video.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for video inpainting based on internal learning. Here are some key ways it compares to other video inpainting research:

- Most prior work relies on external training data and learns priors from large datasets. This paper explores an internal learning approach that trains only on the input video to be inpainted, without any external data. This avoids the need to collect large datasets and train complex models to cover the huge space of videos.

- The proposed method jointly generates both appearance and optical flow, and uses consistency between them during training. Other learning-based video inpainting methods focus only on generating the RGB frames. Explicitly modeling flow helps ensure temporal consistency.

- While many video inpainting methods rely on patch recurrence and propagation, this method uses a convolutional neural network as the underlying generative model. This allows incorporating natural image priors to avoid distortions common in patch synthesis.

- The results demonstrate the method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other internal learning approaches. It also complements patch-based optimization methods, performing especially well on videos with complex motion where patch matching fails.

- A limitation is the long training time required for each video, making it impractical for real-time use. But the exploratory study provides useful insights into internal learning that could inform faster approaches in the future.

Overall, the key novelty is showing internal learning's potential for coherent video synthesis without large-scale external training data. The joint modeling of appearance and flow is also innovative. The work pushes forward video inpainting through a new paradigm complementary to existing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Investigating more efficient optimization algorithms and distributed computing solutions to make their approach more practical by reducing the long processing time required to train an individual model for each input video.

- Exploring how to combine representations learned internally from the input video with externally trained models that leverage large datasets, in order to enable powerful hybrid learning systems. The authors believe combining the strengths of internal and external learning could lead to better methodologies.

- Studying more advanced network architectures with explicit temporal modeling built into the network, such as recurrent networks or sequence modeling approaches like in Vid2Vid. Their method intentionally uses a simple per-frame 2D CNN structure, but they suggest architectures that directly model temporal structure could better handle consistency and coherence in videos.

- Further exploring what network structure can best serve as an image prior to represent video sequence data in the context of internal learning. The capabilities and limitations of different network architectures for encoding temporal video information through internal learning is an open question.

- Generalizing their ideas and framework to related domains beyond video inpainting, such as video super-resolution or prediction problems where internal learning could be beneficial.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the efficiency and practicality of their approach, combining it with external learning, using more sophisticated temporal network architectures, determining optimal network structures for video priors, and extending the internal learning paradigm to other video analysis tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel video inpainting algorithm that simultaneously hallucinates missing appearance and motion (optical flow) information. It builds upon the recent 'Deep Image Prior' technique that exploits convolutional network architectures to enforce plausible texture in static images. The key contributions are:

1) It shows that coherent video inpainting is possible without a priori training, through an internal (within-video) learning approach rather than relying on an external corpus to train a generic model. 

2) The method jointly generates appearance and flow, while exploiting their complementarity to ensure mutual consistency. This not only maintains short-term motion coherence but also propagates information across distant frames for long-term consistency.

3) Experiments on videos from DAVIS and classic datasets show the method leverages appearance statistics specific to each video to achieve visually plausible and coherent inpainting. As a learning-based approach, it avoids shape distortions common in patch-based techniques.

In summary, the work explores the novel direction of internal learning for video inpainting and shows a single 2D CNN can produce high-quality coherent video inpainting results through appropriate training strategies, without external data. It provides complementary strengths to mainstream large-scale learning approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel video inpainting algorithm that simultaneously hallucinates missing appearance and motion information. The method builds upon the recent 'Deep Image Prior' (DIP) approach, which uses convolutional neural network architectures to enforce plausible texture in static image inpainting. The authors make two main contributions in extending DIP to video inpainting. First, they show it is possible to achieve coherent video inpainting without requiring a priori training on a large dataset. Their method takes a generative approach to inpainting based on "internal learning" - training a neural network on the input video itself to learn priors specific to that video. Second, they jointly generate both appearance and optical flow information, and exploit the consistency between these modalities during training to improve results. 

The internal learning approach trains a single frame-based generative model per input video to synthesize all frames independently. To address the key challenge of maintaining temporal consistency, the authors propose a consistency-aware training strategy. This incorporates a loss term that enforces coherence between the jointly predicted appearance and flow. Experiments on videos from existing datasets demonstrate the proposed method can leverage video-specific appearance statistics to produce plausible and temporally consistent inpainting, even for long-term consistency across distant frames. The internal learning approach is shown to complement existing methods relying on large corpus training by handling complex motions well.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video inpainting method based on internal learning. The key idea is to train a single frame-wise generative convolutional neural network (CNN) on the input video to fill in missing regions. The network is trained to jointly predict appearance (RGB frames) and motion (optical flow maps) for each frame using only the known regions in the video as supervision. A consistency loss is introduced to enforce mutual consistency between the predicted frames and flows. This allows information to be propagated across frames during training to improve temporal coherence without reliance on external datasets. The network is trained from scratch on each video, learning video-specific texture and motion priors. Results demonstrate that this approach can achieve plausible and temporally coherent video inpainting using a simple frame-independent model optimized internally on the input video.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a novel video inpainting method that addresses two key challenges in extending image inpainting techniques to video:

1. Ensuring temporal consistency: The hallucinated content must not only be spatially consistent within a frame, but also temporally consistent across frames. This is a much stricter constraint compared to image inpainting.

2. Generalizing to diverse videos: It is difficult to train a single model on an external dataset to learn effective priors for general videos, due to the huge variety and complexity of video content.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes an "internal learning" approach to video inpainting inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). The key ideas are:

- Use the input video itself as training data to learn a convolutional neural network generative model, without reliance on any external data. This allows the model to learn video-specific priors.

- Jointly generate the appearance frames and optical flows, and use a consistency loss to ensure the generated flows and frames match. This enforces temporal consistency. 

- Use a curriculum strategy during training to encourage propagation of information across frames. This handles long-term consistency.

The main contribution is showing that coherent video inpainting is possible using internal learning, without large-scale training on external data. Experiments demonstrate this approach complements existing methods and handles challenging cases like videos with complex motion.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel video inpainting method based on internal learning, without relying on any external training data. The key idea is to extend Deep Image Prior (DIP) to video by training a single image-to-image generative CNN on the input video to inpaint missing regions in a frame-by-frame manner. To address the fundamental challenge of maintaining temporal consistency in video, the method jointly predicts appearance and optical flow in a consistency-aware training framework. Specifically, the network takes in noise maps as input and is trained to generate the frame appearance, as well as bidirectional optical flows to neighboring frames. The training loss enforces consistency between the generated frames and flows. This allows information propagation within and across frames to achieve coherent video inpainting. Experiments demonstrate that despite the simplistic network design and purely internal training process, the proposed method can achieve compelling inpainting results on challenging videos, often outperforming existing learning-based methods trained on large external datasets. The ability to perform convincingly well without external data highlights the surprising effectiveness of internal learning for the highly ill-posed video inpainting problem.
