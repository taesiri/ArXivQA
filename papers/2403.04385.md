# [Impacts of Color and Texture Distortions on Earth Observation Data in   Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04385)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how deep learning models for land cover classification are affected by different types of distortions applied to the input satellite/aerial images during inference. The models considered are popular CNN and transformer architectures such as U-Net, DeeplabV3, and FTUNetFormer. These models are trained on the OpenEarthMap dataset to perform semantic segmentation for land cover classification, using standard data augmentation techniques like random horizontal/vertical flips. 

The key research question explored is: how sensitive are these models to perturbations in color and texture when applied only at test time? The distortions studied include converting pixels of a semantic class to gray-scale (color distortion), randomly swapping pixel values within a semantic class (texture distortion), and duplicating a color channel over all three channels (extreme color distortion).

The key findings are:

- Models are generally invariant to color distortions, even extreme ones like full gray-scale conversion. This suggests inductive biases towards texture over color in these models.

- Models are quite sensitive even to small amounts of texture distortion. For example, swapping just 10-30% of pixels leads to noticeable performance drops.

- Surrounding context is important for accurate classification. When context is removed, texture perturbations degrade performance much more rapidly. 

- Different semantic classes are affected differently. For instance, "range" and "tree" suffer more compared to "water" with the same distortions.

Overall, the paper reveals that popular models for land cover classification rely more on texture cues than color, and perturbing texture can significantly impact predictions. The findings motivate developing augmentation techniques tailored to different semantic classes in aerial/satellite imagery, as well as models more robust to real-world variations in Earth observation data.
