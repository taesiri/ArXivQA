# [Unite and Conquer: Plug &amp; Play Multi-Modal Synthesis using Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: 

How can we perform multimodal generative modeling using diffusion models when we only have access to individual models trained on unpaired data from different modalities?

The key hypothesis is that by deriving a generalized product of experts formulation, they can combine the score predictions from individual diffusion models in a principled way to enable multimodal generative modeling without needing paired training data across modalities. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method to obtain an effective conditional score by combining the scores predicted by diffusion models trained on individual modalities in an optimization framework. This allows "plug-and-play" integration of multiple pre-trained generative models to achieve multimodal synthesis.

The central hypothesis is that by treating each conditional model as an expert in its modality and combining scores in a weighted product-of-experts framework, they can perform high-quality multimodal generation even without access to paired multimodal data for training.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine multiple pre-trained generative models to enable multimodal synthesis, with the core hypothesis being that a generalized product-of-experts formulation provides an effective way to integrate scores across modalities.
