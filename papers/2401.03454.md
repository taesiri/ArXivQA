# [Computational Argumentation-based Chatbots: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chatbots are conversational software applications that interact with users, but they have only recently been combined with computational models of argumentation. 
- Argumentation can enhance chatbots by enabling more natural discourse, coherent responses, and transparent reasoning, but there are few existing argumentation-based chatbots.

Solution:
- The paper surveys the literature on argumentation-based chatbots that employ argumentation for information extraction, structuring, reasoning, or reply delivery.
- 17 existing argumentation-based chatbots are analyzed in detail, classified by purpose (explain, inform, persuade), architecture (rule, retrieval), conversation domain, and argumentation usage.

Key Findings:
- Most common goal is to persuade or explain. Bipolar argumentation frameworks are widely used to model supports and conflicts.  
- Nearly all bots use retrieval-based responses; no generative or open-domain argumentation chatbots exist yet.
- Argumentation is effective for strategic persuasion dialogues. User studies show bots employing concerns outperform random strategies.  
- Argumentation could mitigate issues with latest generative chatbots like emergent abilities, hallucination, poor reasoning, and bias.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive literature survey of argumentation-based chatbots
- Detailed analysis of 17 existing systems classified by multiple key dimensions 
- Discussion of benefits and limitations of existing bots
- Proposal for improving state-of-the-art generative chatbots by integrating argumentation approaches

The paper systematically reviews a novel research area combining chatbots and computational argumentation, highlights current progress and limitations, and offers insights into future directions to develop more capable and transparent conversational agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This survey reviews and analyzes existing chatbots that employ computational models of argumentation for extraction, structuring, reasoning, and delivery of responses to users, finding they are often used for persuasion and explanation goals and frequently leverage argumentation engines and dialogues, though absent generative models, with potential to address limitations of LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive survey and analysis of existing research on argumentation-based chatbots. Specifically, the paper:

- Provides background information on computational argumentation and chatbots to establish key concepts and terminology.

- Outlines the methodology used for reviewing and selecting relevant literature on argumentation-based chatbots. This includes precisely defining what qualifies as an argumentation-based chatbot for the purposes of the survey. 

- Classifies and describes the features of argumentation-based chatbots found in the literature according to how they employ argumentation - for extraction, structuring arguments, reasoning, and delivering responses.  

- Compares and contrasts different argumentation-based chatbots in terms of their purpose, response architecture, conversation domain, etc. through a summary table.

- Discusses main findings, including the prevalence of persuasion and explanation chatbots, the lack of open-domain and generative argumentation-based chatbots, and the potential for argumentation methodologies to address limitations with state-of-the-art transformer-based conversational models.

- Concludes by highlighting the promise of argumentation-based chatbots and their possible future directions, arguing they could play an interesting role alongside advances in transformer architectures and models.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic survey and analysis of the existing literature at the intersection of computational argumentation and conversational agents.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Computational argumentation: Formal models and frameworks for representing and reasoning with arguments and counterarguments. Key concepts include argumentation frameworks, abstract arguments, attack relations, acceptability semantics.

- Chatbots: Conversational software agents that interact with users. Key concepts include response architectures (rule-based, retrieval-based, generative), conversation domains (open, closed), knowledge base acquisition. 

- Argumentation-based chatbots: Chatbots that employ computational argumentation for information extraction, structuring replies, reasoning, and delivering responses via argumentation-based dialogues.

- Argument mining: Automatic extraction of arguments and relations from textual corpora. Involves identifying argument components and attack/support relations. Enables construction of argumentation frameworks.

- Argumentation schemes: Common patterns of reasoning that can structure arguments. Characterized by premises, a conclusion, and critical questions. 

- Argumentation engines: Software tools and solvers that compute argument acceptability semantics and extensions on argumentation frameworks. Enable argumentation-based reasoning and decision making.

- Dialogue protocols: Rule-governed patterns of interaction that enable argumentation-based dialogues between agents. Govern the exchange of arguments to achieve goals like persuasion or inquiry.

So in summary, the key concepts relate to using computational argumentation techniques within conversational chatbot architectures for improved reasoning, explainability, and dialogical interactions. The integration of these two fields is the main focus.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that it "strictly selected only papers involving specific argumentation aspects." Could you elaborate on the exact criteria used to determine which papers qualified as involving argumentation aspects relevant for this survey? What were some borderline cases that were excluded and why?

2. You state that you gathered papers "independently of the year of publication" and did not restrict your search to any particular time ranges. Was there any noticeable trend in terms of more or fewer relevant papers published in certain time periods? If so, what might account for increases or decreases in relevant publications over time?  

3. The process of analyzing and organizing the collected papers into a comparative table categorizing chatbot features seems quite useful. Was the choice of categories pre-determined before reviewing the papers or did new categories emerge inductively from the papers themselves? How was inter-rater reliability ensured in the coding process?  

4. You distinguish between the "primary" and "secondary" reasoning components of argumentation-based chatbots when it comes to selecting replies. Could you expand more on the key differences between these two types of reasoning operations? Are there any chatbots in your sample that combine both?

5. The sample contains no generative argumentation-based chatbots. Do you think such chatbots are fundamentally incompatible or just lacking research attention currently? What unique challenges might a generative + argumentation model encounter compared to other architectures?

6. For the conversational domain classification, what percentage of papers did not specify a domain? Did you make inferences about likely domains for any unspecified chatbots based on examples or other clues in those papers?

7. You highlight the usefulness of argument schemes in chatbots for several functions like mining, structuring, and interpreting text. Of the reviewed papers, which (if any) specifically employed argument schemes versus more general argument extraction methods?

8. You excluded some systems that refer generally to "arguments" but do not use computational argumentation models meeting your specific definition. Was drawing this line difficult in some cases? Could you give an example of a system you debated including or excluding?

9. You connect argumentation's usefulness for chatbots to rising interest in explainable AI. Do you think interest in XAI is a primary driver stimulating research connecting argumentation and chatbots? Or are there other factors at play?

10. You surveyed literature published in English. Do you think surveys of non-English publications might reveal more chatbot systems leveraging computational argumentation, especially in Europe? Or is research generally shared across languages?
