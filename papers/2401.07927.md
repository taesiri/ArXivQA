# [Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07927)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) like Llama2 and Falcon can provide very convincing self-explanations for their predictions and behavior. However, since these models sometimes hallucinate or are opaque, wrong but seemingly reasonable explanations could lead to unsupported confidence and trust in their capabilities by users. 

- Assessing the faithfulness ("interpretability-faithfulness") of LLM self-explanations is challenging, as the models are too complex for humans to manually evaluate what constitutes a correct explanation of the model's reasoning process.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using self-consistency checks to evaluate the faithfulness of LLM self-explanations. For example, if a model says certain words were important for making a prediction, the prediction should change if those words are removed.

- They apply this methodology to evaluate three types of self-explanations: counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions.

Key Contributions:
- First work to measure interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations from instruction-tuned LLMs using self-consistency checks.

- Show faithfulness is dependent on model type, size and task. For sentiment analysis, counterfactuals worked best for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, redactions for Falcon 40B.

- Demonstrate approach generalizes across different datasets - sentiment analysis, multi-choice QA, natural language inference.

- Findings are robust to variations in how the self-explanations are elicited.

Implications:
- Self-explanations from chatbots cannot necessarily be trusted as faithful explanations of model reasoning, underscoring risks around unsupported trust. More rigor around faithfulness needed as LLMs continue proliferating.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the faithfulness of instruction-tuned large language models by applying self-consistency checks to different types of self-explanations across various datasets and finds the faithfulness to be both task and model dependent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes using self-consistency checks to evaluate the interpretability-faithfulness of large language models' (LLMs) self-explanations, including counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous work has measured the faithfulness of self-explanations generated by LLMs. The paper shows that faithfulness is dependent on both the task and the model architecture/size. It demonstrates the methodology on sentiment analysis, QA, and natural language inference tasks. The results highlight concerns about overconfidence in LLMs' ability to explain themselves and suggest that self-explanation faithfulness should be an evaluation criterion going forward.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and demonstrating a methodology for evaluating the faithfulness of LLMs' self-explanations using self-consistency checks.

The paper focuses on evaluating the faithfulness (or interpretability-faithfulness) of explanations generated by large language models about their own reasoning, referred to as "self-explanations". It applies self-consistency checks to three types of self-explanations - counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions. The goal is to assess if these explanations accurately reflect the models' reasoning processes, rather than just being convincing but potentially unsupported rationalizations. Key aspects examined include variation across tasks, models, prompt design, and robustness to prompt changes. Overall, this work aims to shed light on the safety and reliability of explanations from increasingly ubiquitous LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the limitations of using self-consistency checks to evaluate the interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations from large language models? How could the methodology be improved to provide a more nuanced measure of faithfulness?

2. Why is prompt robustness an important consideration when evaluating the faithfulness of self-explanations? How does the author test and demonstrate prompt robustness in the paper?

3. The author categorizes the different types of hallucinations that can occur with large language models. How do self-consistency checks for self-explanations differ from evaluating these types of hallucinations?  

4. What assumptions does the methodology presented make about the capabilities of large language models? How could violations of these assumptions impact the results and conclusions?

5. How does framing the prompts as chat conversations potentially impact the faithfulness results compared to using a purely instructional prompt? What are the tradeoffs?

6. What are some examples of how incorrect but seemingly convincing self-explanations from language models could potentially lead to dangerous real-world consequences?  

7. Why can't popular models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 be evaluated using this methodology? What barriers exist to reproducing results across various model versions?

8. How does the concept of self-model capabilities relate to and potentially impact the faithfulness of self-explanations? How was this explored separately from faithfulness in the paper?

9. What are some ways the set of tasks and explanation types analyzed in the paper could be expanded in future work? What other self-explanation methods merit investigation?  

10. Could the methodology proposed also be used to improve faithfulness by directly fine-tuning models? What challenges exist with taking this approach?
