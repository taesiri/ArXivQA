# [Towards Modeling Uncertainties of Self-explaining Neural Networks via   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks lack interpretability and it is hard to understand the reasons behind their predictions. This limits their application in critical areas. 
- Self-explaining neural networks are proposed to provide inherent interpretability by generating explanations along with predictions. However, existing self-explaining networks lack the ability to provide reliable and distribution-free uncertainty estimates for the generated explanations as well as final predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework (unSENN) for modeling uncertainties in self-explaining networks using conformal prediction. 
- It introduces novel non-conformity measures to quantify the strangeness of generated explanations without relying on ground truth explanations. This allows constructing tight explanation prediction sets that reflect model confidence.
- To get better final prediction sets, it designs effective transfer functions and formulates new optimization problems inspired by adversarial attacks. This allows properly transferring explanation uncertainties to final predictions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first uncertainty modeling framework for self-explaining networks to produce reliable confidence estimates for both explanations and predictions.
- Introduces new non-conformity scores and transfer functions to construct tight conformal sets at both explanation and prediction levels.
- Provides theoretical analysis to show validity guarantees for the obtained explanation and prediction sets.  
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets and comparisons with baselines.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards building trustworthy self-explaining models via principled uncertainty quantification. The proposed techniques can pave the way for safer deployment of interpretable deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called unSENN for modeling uncertainties of self-explaining neural networks by leveraging conformal prediction to provide distribution-free confidence estimates for both the generated explanations and predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is designing a novel uncertainty modeling framework (unSENN) for self-explaining neural networks. Specifically, unSENN can:

1) Demonstrate strong distribution-free uncertainty modeling performance for the generated explanations in the interpretation layer of self-explaining networks. 

2) Excel in producing efficient and effective prediction sets for the final predictions based on the informative high-level basis explanations.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a way to quantify uncertainty in both the explanation outputs and final predictions of self-explaining neural networks, leveraging the structured interpretability inherent in these models. The proposed unSENN framework does not make assumptions about the data distribution and can provide reliability guarantees on the predictions.
