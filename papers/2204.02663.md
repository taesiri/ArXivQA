# Towards An End-to-End Framework for Flow-Guided Video Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is developing an end-to-end framework for video inpainting that can effectively fill in missing regions in video frames while maintaining both spatial and temporal coherence. The key points are:- Recent video inpainting methods that utilize optical flow for propagation tend to have multiple isolated stages (flow completion, pixel propagation, content hallucination) that are prone to error accumulation and rely heavily on intermediate results. - The authors propose an end-to-end framework called E2FGVI that closely integrates corresponding modules - flow completion, feature propagation, and content hallucination. This allows joint optimization and alleviates dependence on intermediate results.- For flow completion, they use a one-step approach applied directly on masked videos rather than multi-stage refinement. - For feature propagation, they conduct it in feature space using deformable convolutions rather than pixel space to release pressure on inaccurate flow estimation.- For content hallucination, they use a novel temporal focal transformer that considers both local and non-local frames to generate coherent results.- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on accuracy metrics and significantly improved efficiency over previous flow-based approaches.In summary, the main hypothesis is that an end-to-end learnable approach can outperform previous flow-based methods that rely on isolated hand-crafted stages. Their proposed E2FGVI framework aims to demonstrate this.
