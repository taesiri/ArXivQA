# [Harnessing Network Effect for Fake News Mitigation: Selecting Debunkers   via Self-Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03357)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fake news spreads widely on social networks, causing harm. An important strategy beyond fake news detection is mitigation, where debunkers (users spreading true news) are deployed to counter fake news.  
- Existing works overlook a key challenge - the "net" effect of selecting debunkers cannot be directly observed, only the final collective effect is visible at the end of a campaign. This is an episodic reward setting.

Proposed Solution: 
- Formulate fake news mitigation as a reinforcement learning problem to select debunkers over multiple stages under a budget constraint. Address episodic rewards via self-imitation learning.
- Propose NAGASIL - Negative sampling and state Augmented Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning. Two key improvements:
   1) Learn from negative samples: Past bad experiences inform agent of undesirable actions, improving sampling efficiency of good experiences.
   2) Augmented state representation: Integrate current state with historical state-action pairs to better capture environment state.
   
Main Contributions:
- First approach to address the overlooked challenge of episodic rewards for fake news mitigation via reinforcement learning. 
- Propose NAGASIL with two novel components - negative sampling and augmented states to improve self-imitation learning.
- Demonstrate superiority of NAGASIL over state-of-the-art baselines on real-world and synthetic social networks.  

The paper makes important progress on fake news mitigation using debunkers by explicitly handling the episodic reward issue via an enhanced self-imitation learning approach.
