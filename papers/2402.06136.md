# [SIR: Multi-view Inverse Rendering with Decomposable Shadow for Indoor   Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Inverse rendering for indoor scenes is challenging due to complex lighting conditions and geometry. Specifically, accurately estimating materials like albedo while cleanly separating shadows is difficult. Existing methods either struggle with shadow fidelity under unknown light positions or require explicit shadow supervision.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SIR (Shadow Inverse Rendering), a multi-view inverse rendering framework for indoor scenes. The key ideas and contributions are:

1) Uses an SDF-based neural radiance field for representing geometry and HDR radiance. This allows capturing complex indoor topologies. 

2) Employs multi-view HDR images which provide more accurate lighting information compared to LDR.

3) Introduces a hard shadow term estimated from the HDR neural radiance field to avoid baking shadows into albedo during optimization.

4) Presents a soft differentiable shadow term to represent nuanced shadow details beyond a hard binary shadow.

5) Proposes a 3-stage material estimation strategy: 
   (i) Optimize albedo with hard shadows
   (ii) Optimize soft shadow and albedo
   (iii) Regularize albedo and roughness

This decomposes albedo and shadows effectively without needing explicit shadow supervision.  

6) Achieves state-of-the-art inverse rendering quality on synthetic and real datasets. Enables editing applications like relighting, object insertion and material replacement.

In summary, SIR advances multi-view inverse rendering for indoor scenes by introducing an efficient way to decompose shadows and albedo. The combination of HDR radiance fields, hard and soft shadows, and the 3-stage optimization allows estimating high quality SVBRDFs useful for scene editing tasks.
