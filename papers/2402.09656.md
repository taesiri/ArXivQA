# [The Butterfly Effect of Model Editing: Few Edits Can Trigger Large   Language Models Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Model editing aims to efficiently update language models without costly retraining. However, the paper reveals a critical risk - even a single edit can trigger catastrophic "model collapse", causing significant performance degradation on various tasks. 

- Existing metrics like "locality" are insufficient to detect collapse. Downstream benchmarking after each edit is impractical. There is a need for an efficient surrogate metric.

- It is unclear if collapse is a widespread issue across models and editing methods in practical sequential editing scenarios.

Solutions:
- The paper proposes using perplexity on human-written text as a collapse indicator, validated to strongly correlate with downstream performance. A dataset "ME-PPL" is curated to enable reliable perplexity measurement.

- Systematic studies on single and sequential editing scenarios reveal prevalent collapse across models and methods after just a few edits, highlighting risks of current techniques. 

- To facilitate further research, the paper uses GPT-3.5 to construct a challenging dataset "HardCF" of edits likely to trigger collapse. Experiments confirm its efficacy.

Key Contributions:
- Revealing model editing can trigger catastrophic model collapse even with one edit.
- Validating perplexity as an efficient indicator of collapse.
- Empirically demonstrating prevalent collapse risks across models and methods.
- Developing datasets to enable perplexity measurement and method evaluations towards reliable model editing techniques.
- Calling attention to address concealed side effects of modifying language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper reveals that even a single edit via current model editing techniques can severely damage large language models, causing significant performance degradation indicative of model collapse.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Unveiling a critical yet previously unknown issue - even a single edit can trigger large language model collapse, manifesting as significant performance degradation across various tasks.

2. Proposing to use perplexity as a metric to evaluate model collapse in the context of model editing, and validating its efficacy through experiments showing strong correlation with downstream task performance. 

3. Demonstrating through systematic study that model collapse is a prevalent issue across different editing algorithms and language models after only a few edits on specific challenging data samples. 

4. Employing ChatGPT to construct a rigorous dataset HardCF for enabling comprehensive evaluation of model editing techniques' vulnerability to collapse, promoting further research into developing reliable editing methods.

In summary, the paper highlights the serious risks of current model editing techniques causing language models to collapse, serving as a cautionary call to the community to address the potential side effects of modifying language models. It also facilitates further research through the introduced dataset HardCF.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Model editing - The practice of modifying pre-trained language models to update their knowledge without full retraining. A key focus of the paper.

- Model collapse - The phenomenon where editing a model severely impacts its capabilities on downstream tasks. The paper aims to study this.  

- Perplexity - A metric proposed in the paper to efficiently detect model collapse after edits, validated through experiments.

- Single edit - Editing a model one time with new knowledge. The paper studies collapse after single edits.

- Sequential editing - Continuously editing a model with multiple pieces of new knowledge over time. Also studied.  

- Hard cases - Specific examples that tend to trigger collapse with edits. The paper collects these to build a challenging dataset.

- HardCF - A novel dataset constructed to enable thorough testing of model editing methods, containing hard cases.

- Locality - A common evaluation metric that measures side effects of edits. The paper argues this is insufficient.

So in summary, the key topics focus on model editing, editing-induced model collapse, use of perplexity to detect this collapse, study of collapse under different edit settings, collection of hard cases, and proposal of a new robust evaluation dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using perplexity as a metric to detect model collapse in edited language models. What are some potential limitations or drawbacks of using perplexity for this purpose compared to more direct downstream task evaluation?

2. The paper finds model collapse can occur from just a single edit. What might be some reasons or mechanisms underlying why an edit to a very small portion of parameters can destabilize the entire model? 

3. The authors construct a challenging dataset "HardCF" to rigorously evaluate model editing methods. What are some ways this dataset could be expanded or improved to make it an even more thorough test of editing robustness?

4. For the perplexity computations, texts from various corpora are combined. Could the choice of texts impact results, and if so, how might they account for potential corpus-specific effects?

5. The authors demonstrate widespread model collapse across editing methods in the sequential editing experiments. Are there any commonalities across techniques or models that could explain this pervasive instability phenomenon?

6. The paper indicates parameter alterations underlie collapse for edited Llama models. Are these changes localized or more systemic, and could certain parameters be more vulnerable? 

7. The authors utilize GPT-3.5 to generate challenging samples. Could this approach introduce any biases or limitations compared to human-curated data? If so, how might they be addressed?

8. The paper studies model editing techniques that directly alter parameters. How might the conclusions differ for methods based on external memorization or calibration? What risks could these approaches entail?

9. For the downstream tasks evaluated, are certain categories like generative tasks more prone to degradation? Could the impacts on models be non-uniform?

10. The authors rightfully caution against real-world usage of current editing methods. What next steps are vital to translating editing techniques into practical applications without risks of model collapse?
