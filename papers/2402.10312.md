# [Towards Tight Convex Relaxations for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Planning optimal trajectories for robotic systems interacting with the environment through contacts is challenging. Such tasks involve hybrid and underactuated dynamics, making motion planning difficult. Existing methods either decouple the discrete and continuous aspects leading to suboptimal plans, or use global optimization algorithms that scale poorly. There is a need for an efficient algorithm that can find near globally-optimal solutions for contact-rich planning problems.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes representing the planning problem as a shortest path problem in a graph of convex sets. Each vertex in the graph corresponds to a contact mode, and is associated with a convex set that captures the quasi-static dynamics for that mode. These quasi-static dynamics are non-convex quadratic programs that couple the object's pose, contact locations and forces. The paper shows how to formulate a tight semidefinite relaxation of these non-convex programs. Edges represent feasible transitions between modes. Finding the shortest path corresponds to optimizing over both discrete mode sequences and continuous trajectories within each mode. 

The overall planning problem can thus be posed as a mixed-integer convex program, that the paper shows can be effectively relaxed to a semidefinite program. This relaxation can be efficiently solved and rounded to obtain a high-quality feasible trajectory. The gap between the rounded solution and the relaxation also provides optimality guarantees.

As an application, the paper focuses on planar pushing, where both simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the method's ability to find near globally-optimal solutions.
