# [Towards Tight Convex Relaxations for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Planning optimal trajectories for robotic systems interacting with the environment through contacts is challenging. Such tasks involve hybrid and underactuated dynamics, making motion planning difficult. Existing methods either decouple the discrete and continuous aspects leading to suboptimal plans, or use global optimization algorithms that scale poorly. There is a need for an efficient algorithm that can find near globally-optimal solutions for contact-rich planning problems.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes representing the planning problem as a shortest path problem in a graph of convex sets. Each vertex in the graph corresponds to a contact mode, and is associated with a convex set that captures the quasi-static dynamics for that mode. These quasi-static dynamics are non-convex quadratic programs that couple the object's pose, contact locations and forces. The paper shows how to formulate a tight semidefinite relaxation of these non-convex programs. Edges represent feasible transitions between modes. Finding the shortest path corresponds to optimizing over both discrete mode sequences and continuous trajectories within each mode. 

The overall planning problem can thus be posed as a mixed-integer convex program, that the paper shows can be effectively relaxed to a semidefinite program. This relaxation can be efficiently solved and rounded to obtain a high-quality feasible trajectory. The gap between the rounded solution and the relaxation also provides optimality guarantees.

As an application, the paper focuses on planar pushing, where both simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the method's ability to find near globally-optimal solutions.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of contact-rich planning as shortest path problem in graph of convex sets 

- Tight semidefinite relaxation of non-convex dynamics within each contact mode

- Single convex optimization algorithm to simultaneously optimize discrete modes and continuous trajectories

- Demonstration of near globally-optimal performance on planar pushing task, backed by theoretical optimality guarantees

- Results highlight the approach's ability to efficiently solve challenging contact-rich planning problems to high quality


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for near-globally optimal motion planning for robotic manipulation tasks involving contacts by formulating the problem as a shortest path in a graph of convex sets, where each vertex represents a contact mode modeled by a semidefinite relaxation, and edges represent feasible transitions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method for global motion planning of robotic systems that interact with the environment through contacts. Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the motion planning problem as a shortest path problem in a graph of convex sets, where paths in the graph correspond to contact sequences and convex sets model the quasi-static dynamics within each contact mode. 

2) For each contact mode, a tight semidefinite programming relaxation is used to approximate the nonconvex dynamics that results from the simultaneous optimization of the object's pose, contact locations, and contact forces. 

3) This allows the overall planning problem to be formulated as a single convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved and quickly rounded to find a feasible globally near-optimal contact-rich trajectory.

4) The method is demonstrated on the task of planar pushing, where experiments show the planner is able to consistently generate near globally-optimal solutions. The quality of the trajectories is also validated on a real robotic system.

In summary, the main contribution is a computationally-efficient method to globally reason about complex contact-rich planning problems by formulating them as a single convex optimization program. The efficiency and quality of the method is demonstrated on planar pushing tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Planar pushing - The paper focuses on the task of planar pushing as an application of the proposed motion planning framework. This involves using a robotic finger to manipulate the motion of a sliding object on a flat surface.

- Graph of convex sets (GCS) - The paper formulates the motion planning problem as a shortest path problem in a graph of convex sets. Paths in the graph correspond to contact sequences and convex sets model the dynamics within each contact mode.

- Quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) - The dynamics within each contact mode is formulated as a nonconvex QCQP which is then approximated by a semidefinite relaxation.

- Semidefinite programming (SDP) / Semidefinite relaxation (SDR) - Tight SDP/SDRs are used to relax the nonconvex QCQPs representing the dynamics in each contact mode. This enables efficient convex optimization.

- Mixed-integer convex program (MICP) - The overall planning problem can be formulated as a MICP with binary variables representing modes and continuous variables for motions.

- Optimality gap - The difference in cost between the rounded solution and the convex relaxation provides an upper bound on the gap from global optimality.

- Shortest path problem (SPP) - The global planning problem is posed as an SPP on the graph of convex sets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper formulates the motion planning problem as a shortest path problem in a graph of convex sets. Can you explain in more detail how the graph is constructed? What do the vertices and edges represent? 

2. The dynamics within each contact mode is formulated as a non-convex QCQP which is then relaxed into an SDP. What is the intuition behind why this relaxation is tight for the planar pushing application?

3. The paper claims the relaxation is tight but does not provide a formal proof. What would be required mathematically to prove the tightness of the relaxation?

4. Regularization terms are added to the cost function which empirically improve the tightness of the relaxation. Can you explain the intuition behind why these terms help? Is there a way to automatically find good regularization terms?

5. The size of the optimization problem grows quickly with the number of faces on the slider. What are some ways the problem size could be reduced to improve computational efficiency?

6. The paper focuses on planar pushing, but claims the method generalizes to more complex contact tasks. What modifications would be needed to apply the approach to other tasks like dexterous manipulation?

7. The optimal plans are executed in open-loop on the hardware, with a stabilizing MPC controller wrapping around them. What challenges arise when executing the open-loop plans and how does the MPC help mitigate them?  

8. How does the performance of this global optimization approach compare to learning-based methods like RL and BC in terms of plan quality and computational efficiency? What are the tradeoffs?

9. The paper claims the relaxations are tight but only shows empirically that the trajectories found are near globally optimal. How could you formally verify the global optimality of a solution?

10. The plans generated often perform well open-loop, indicating they are somewhat robust. Can you modify or augment the planning approach to explicitly optimize for robustness?
