# [LD-SDM: Language-Driven Hierarchical Species Distribution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08334)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for hierarchical species distribution modeling (SDM) using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to leverage the taxonomic hierarchy information of species, represented as text prompts, to enhance SDM. This allows flexible modeling at any taxonomic level and for unseen species without additional supervision. Specifically, the authors reformulate the SDM problem to predict location likelihood for a given species, enabling the integration of species embeddings from LLaMA-2. The model has three components - a location encoder using Spherical Fourier Neural Operators, a frozen LLaMA-2 text encoder, and a cross-attention based classifier. For evaluation, a new metric called Probability Weighted Chamfer Distance is introduced to assess proximity-aware false positive rates using pixel-level ground truth maps. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on species range prediction, zero-shot generalization, and geo-feature regression tasks. Different LLaMA-2 model capacities are analyzed, with the 70B variant achieving the best results. Overall, the incorporation of taxonomic knowledge through large language models significantly advances species distribution modeling.
