# [StableVITON: Learning Semantic Correspondence with Latent Diffusion   Model for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01725)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes StableVITON, a novel end-to-end virtual try-on method that finetunes a pre-trained diffusion model without requiring an independent warping process. It introduces a spatial encoder and novel zero cross-attention blocks that enable learning semantic correspondence between clothing and the human body within the latent space of the diffusion model. This allows leveraging the model's inherent knowledge about humans for high-fidelity image generation while preserving clothing details. Further, an attention total variation loss and data augmentation are proposed to sharpen attention maps for more precise clothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over existing GAN and diffusion-based baselines in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Notably, cross dataset evaluation on complex backgrounds exhibits StableVITON's promising quality and real-world applicability. The method's effectiveness stems from effectively harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models while learning precise spatial alignment for detail preservation, overcoming limitations in prior arts.
