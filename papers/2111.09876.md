# [One-Shot Generative Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09876)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we adapt a pre-trained GAN model to a new target domain using only a single or very few example images from that new domain?The key challenge is that with only 1 or a few images, it is very difficult to adapt the model while still maintaining high quality and diversity of generated images. So the paper proposes a new approach called GenDA that aims to effectively transfer a pre-trained GAN to a new target domain using just a single reference image. The main hypotheses seem to be:1) Freezing the weights of a pre-trained generator and discriminator backbone, and only learning lightweight adapter modules on top, will allow the model to retain prior knowledge and generation quality/diversity.2) Using an attribute adaptor module to transform the latent code can help the generator acquire the key attributes of the reference image. 3) Adding an attribute classifier on the discriminator can guide the generator to make proper attribute adjustments through adversarial training.4) Constraining the diversity of the generator during training by truncating the latent distribution will make the one-to-one mapping easier to learn.So in summary, the central research question is few-shot/one-shot GAN adaptation, and the main hypothesis is that the proposed lightweight adapter approach with diversity truncation can effectively transfer a GAN to a new domain with just a single reference image while retaining high quality and diversity.
