# [MambaMIR: An Arbitrary-Masked Mamba for Joint Medical Image   Reconstruction and Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Medical image reconstruction is a fundamental and critical component in medical imaging workflows. However, typical acquisition processes are slow and can introduce artifacts. Fast MRI aims to accelerate MRI scans by subsampling k-space measurements. Sparse-view CT reduces radiation exposure by using fewer projection views. But both can result in poor image quality. Thus, developing reliable reconstruction models is important yet challenging.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes MambaMIR - the first Mamba-based model for medical image reconstruction. Also explores MambaMIR-GAN variants with GAN training.

2) Introduces a novel Arbitrary-Mask mechanism that randomly masks redundant scan sequences. This adapts Mamba to handle non-causal medical image data and also enables Monte Carlo-based uncertainty estimation.  

3) Demonstrates state-of-the-art or comparable reconstruction performance to existing methods on fast MRI and sparse-view CT tasks. Models tested on knee, chest and abdomen scans. Uncertainty maps also provide useful insights on reconstruction reliability.

Proposed Method:

Architecture:
- Linear complexity for processing long, high-res sequences 
- Global receptive fields and dynamic weights for global sensitivity 

Components:
- Arbitrary-Masked S6 Block 
     + Randomly masks scans for uncertainty  
     + Core S6 module for sequence modelling
- Input, Output, Residual Connections 
- AMSS Block Groups with AMSS Blocks
     
Training Scheme:
- Charbonnier + perceptual losses 
- Options: MambaMIR or MambaMIR-GAN (with adversarial loss)

Experiments: 
- Datasets: FastMRI, Low-Dose CT (chest, abdomen)
- Metrics: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS
- Compared to state-of-the-art CNN & Transformer models
- Achieves top performance on both MRI and CT tasks
- Uncertainty maps validate reconstruction reliability

Conclusion:
MambaMIR delivers comparable or better reconstructions than existing methods on MRI and CT data. MambaMIR-GAN enhances perceptual quality. Uncertainty maps also provide useful insights. Demonstrates promise of using Mamba-based models for medical image reconstruction.
