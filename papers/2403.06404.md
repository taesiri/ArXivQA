# [Cosine Scoring with Uncertainty for Neural Speaker Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Speaker recognition systems extract speaker embeddings to represent speech utterances, followed by a scoring backend like cosine similarity to verify the speaker. 
- However, speech utterances have intrinsic variability (e.g. emotion) and extrinsic variability (e.g. background noise) that affect the speaker embeddings. 
- Conventional cosine scoring lacks capability to handle the uncertainty in embeddings arising from these variabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Propagate uncertainty from embedding extraction to cosine scoring backend. 
- Model embedding extraction as a Gaussian inference process to get posterior mean (embedding) and precision (uncertainty).
- Propose uncertainty-propagated (UP) cosine scoring that uses covariance matrices to weigh dimensions differently based on uncertainty.
- UP-cosine interpretable as cosine of inner product between embeddings, normalized by their Mahalanobis distance lengths.

Key Contributions:
- First work to propagate uncertainty to cosine scoring for speaker recognition.
- Achieved average 8.5% and 9.8% EER and minDCF reduction over baseline on VoxCeleb and SITW datasets.
- Showed negative correlation between uncertainty (posterior covariance) and speech duration.
- Computationally efficient for practical use.

In summary, the paper proposes an uncertainty-aware cosine scoring to handle variability in speech by weighting dimensions differently based on uncertainty estimates. Experiments show consistency improvement over baseline, confirming efficacy of proposed scoring.
