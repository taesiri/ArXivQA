# [SkySense: A Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Foundation Model Towards   Universal Interpretation for Earth Observation Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Prior Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) are limited in handling diverse tasks due to focusing on single modalities, lacking temporal modeling, and not utilizing geo-context information. An ideal RSFM should support multi-modal temporal data, flexible usage for different tasks, and effective geo-context learning. 

Proposed Solution - SkySense:
- Pre-trains a large-scale model (2B parameters) on a curated multi-modal RSI dataset with 21.5M temporal sequences of optical, multispectral, and SAR data.

- Uses a modular Factorized Multi-modal Spatiotemporal Encoder to separately model spatial and temporal patterns, enabling flexible usage for both single and multi-modal scenarios.

- Employs Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning to construct features capturing diverse spatial scales (pixel/object/image levels) and modalities. 

- Introduces Geo-Context Prototype Learning to learn regional prototypes linked to geo-locations, integrating valuable geo-contextual information into the representations.

Key Contributions:
- SkySense is the largest Multi-Modal RSFM to date, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in handling diverse remote sensing tasks and modalities.

- The modular and flexible architecture enables selective usage and combination of different components for various downstream needs. 

- Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning and Geo-Context Prototype Learning enhance feature learning across scales and integrate regional contextual knowledge respectively.

- Extensive experiments over 16 datasets and 7 tasks demonstrate SkySense's superior performance, surpassing top models like SatLas and Scale-MAE by large margins.

In summary, SkySense pushes boundaries of Multi-Modal RSFMs via its scale, flexibility and pre-training strategies, unlocking immense potential for remote sensing imagery understanding. The comprehensive evaluations substantiate its state-of-the-art capabilities across diverse tasks.
