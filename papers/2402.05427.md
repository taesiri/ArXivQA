# [A Sampling Theory Perspective on Activations for Implicit Neural   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are gaining popularity for encoding signals compactly and differentiably. However, commonly used techniques like Fourier encodings or non-traditional activations (Gaussian, sinusoid, wavelets) lack a unified theoretical framework to analyze their properties for signal reconstruction. 

Main Contributions:
- The paper provides a fresh perspective on understanding activations in INRs through the lens of sampling theory. 

- It is shown that under mild conditions, activations in INRs can be viewed as generator functions that facilitate signal reconstruction from sparse samples.

- Leveraging sampling theory concepts, the paper demonstrates that sinc activations are optimal for signal reconstruction by INRs, enabling exact recovery of bandlimited signals and approximate reconstruction for general square integrable signals.

- Sinc activations, though unexplored in INRs until now, are shown to form Riesz bases, making them ideally suited for modeling signals in L2(R). Other common activations like ReLU, sinusoid, Gaussians only form weak Riesz bases.

- The connection between dynamical systems and INRs is established using sampling theory. It is shown that modeling dynamical systems can be posed as a signal reconstruction problem, elucidating why sinc-INRs perform remarkably well in learning chaotic and complex systems.

- Extensive experiments validate the theoretical predictions, showcasing superior or on-par performance of sinc-INRs on tasks like image reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and dynamical system modeling.

In summary, the paper offers an elegant sampling theory view to disambiguate and analyze different activation choices for INRs, revealing sinc functions as the optimal option. The dynamical system modeling perspective is an interesting extension enabled by this framework.
