# [Researchy Questions: A Dataset of Multi-Perspective, Decompositional   Questions for LLM Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing QA datasets are no longer challenging for large language models (LLMs). Many benchmarks like TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, etc. have been nearly solved.
- These datasets mainly study "known unknowns" where it's clear what information is missing and how to find it. They don't capture complex questions with unclear information needs.
- There is a need for a dataset with non-factoid, multi-perspective questions that require analyzing multiple documents. Such complex questions are like "unknown unknowns".

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents "Researchy Questions", a dataset of nearly 100K queries filtered from search logs to be non-factoid and multi-perspective. 
- These questions require effort to answer, involve analyzing multiple documents, and don't have a single correct answer.
- The dataset provides the decomposition of each question into sub-questions in a hierarchy.
- It also provides the URLs of documents that users actually clicked for each question in the ClueWeb corpus.

Main Contributions:
- Construction methodology to filter complex questions from search logs.
- Release of the "Researchy Questions" dataset with 96K queries, hierarchical decompositions, and clicked URLs.
- Analysis showing questions require more user effort, and are more challenging for LLMs.
- Evaluation of decompositional answering techniques that show benefit over direct answering.
- The concept of "Pivotal Facts" that are surprising pieces of evidence that greatly change how an answer is constructed.

The paper addresses the limitations of current QA datasets and provides a valuable resource to study how agents handle complex questions involving unclear information needs and analysis of multiple documents.
