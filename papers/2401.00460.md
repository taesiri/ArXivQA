## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the LaTeX source code provided, this paper seems to plot training loss over steps/iterations for a neural network model. Some keywords or key terms I would associate with this paper are:

- Training loss
- Smoothing
- Neural network
- Optimization 
- Steps/iterations
- Model evaluation

The source code plots the actual training loss values as well as smoothed values over the course of model training. So it provides an analysis of how loss changed over time and how smoothing impacts the loss curve. Key terms related to this analysis include training loss, smoothing, neural network model, optimization steps, model evaluation.
