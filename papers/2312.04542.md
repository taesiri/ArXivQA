# [SoK: Unintended Interactions among Machine Learning Defenses and Risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04542)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a framework for understanding unintended interactions between machine learning defenses and risks. The authors conjecture that overfitting and memorization are underlying causes of such interactions. They introduce factors influencing overfitting (e.g. model capacity, training data size) and memorization (e.g. tail length of data distribution, curvature smoothness of the objective function), relating them to various defenses (like adversarial training, differential privacy) and risks (such as evasion, membership inference). Using the correlation between defenses, risks and common influencing factors, they provide guidelines to hypothesize previously unexplored interactions and empirically validate conjectures about two such interactions - between explanations and distribution inference, and between group fairness and data reconstruction. Their framework helps gain a nuanced, structured understanding of unintended interactions, allowing researchers identify open problems and practitioners mitigate negative interactions. With flexibility to accommodate new defenses, risks and interactions, this paper makes an important contribution towards building safe, reliable and ethical ML systems.
