# [SoK: Unintended Interactions among Machine Learning Defenses and Risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04542)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models face various risks to security, privacy and fairness. Several defenses have been proposed to mitigate these risks. However, when a defense aims to mitigate one risk, it can unintentionally increase or decrease the model's susceptibility to other risks. These are called "unintended interactions". There is currently no systematic framework to identify, explain and predict such unintended interactions early on. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework to examine unintended interactions by attributing them to two underlying causes - overfitting and memorization of training data. The framework identifies different factors that collectively influence a model's tendency to overfit or memorize, which in turn impacts susceptibility to different risks when defenses are used. These factors relate to the training data, objective function, and model characteristics. 

Using these factors, the paper surveys known unintended interactions from prior work and shows how the framework provides a systematic way to understand them. The paper also provides a guideline using these factors to conjecture about the nature of unintended interactions early on. It demonstrates this by conjecturing on two unexplored interactions and validating them empirically.

Main Contributions:

1) First systematic framework attributing unintended interactions to overfitting and memorization, using factors influencing them for explainability.

2) Literature survey situating known unintended interactions within the framework. 

3) Guideline to conjecture potential unintended interactions early on using the framework.

4) Demonstration of framework by conjecturing two unexplored interactions and validating empirically.

The framework provides a way for researchers to identify unexplored interactions early on and for practitioners to account for them before deployment. It is also flexible to include new defenses, risks and underlying factors as they emerge.
