# [Improving the performance of weak supervision searches using transfer   and meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06152)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores using transfer learning and meta-learning to improve the performance of weak supervision searches, which have the advantages of supervised and unsupervised learning but can require prohibitive amounts of signal to train effectively. The authors implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained via the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) method on jet images to distinguish signal from background. They find CWoLa alone displays a threshold below which the CNN fails to learn due to limited signal. They then employ transfer learning via pretraining on simulations and fine-tuning on data, which drastically enhances performance and lowers the threshold. Finally, they implement meta-transfer learning, adding learnable scaling and shifting parameters to make the CNN a better learner. This provides a slight additional boost. Overall, transfer learning and meta-learning allow the CNN to learn its task with less signal, greatly improving the viability of weak supervision searches. The authors suggest further optimization and studies into transfer and meta-learning for weak supervision are warranted given these very promising proof-of-principle results.
