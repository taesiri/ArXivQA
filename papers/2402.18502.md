# [Few-Shot Fairness: Unveiling LLM's Potential for Fairness-Aware   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are being increasingly used for various downstream applications such as classification tasks. However, there are concerns that LLMs may perpetuate biases and unfairness in their predictions, which can negatively impact underprivileged groups. 

- There is a lack of research on achieving fairness through in-context learning in LLMs for classification tasks. Prior work has focused more on training methods to reduce bias rather than utilizing the innate capabilities of LLMs.

Solution:
- The paper introduces a framework to specify different definitions of fairness (e.g. demographic parity, equal opportunity etc.) as rules in the prompt provided to the LLM. 

- Experiments are conducted with multiple LLMs (Llama, GPT-4, Gemini) on an income classification task using the Adult dataset. Fairness metrics are evaluated in both zero-shot and few-shot learning setups.

Main Contributions:

- First investigation into ensuring fairness via in-context learning for classification tasks by specifying fairness notions
- Comparison of state-of-the-art LLMs under different fairness criteria 
- Analysis of accuracy-fairness tradeoff in zero-shot and few-shot configurations
- Findings reveal GPT-4 demonstrates superior performance on both accuracy and fairness metrics
- LLMs exhibit understanding of fairness but still display some bias favoring one demographic group

Overall, the paper makes early progress towards achieving fair outcomes from LLMs for prediction tasks using in-context learning to guide the models, instead of more complex fine-tuning approaches. GPT-4 emerges as the most effective model on this front based on the income classification experiments.
