# [HyperCUT: Video Sequence from a Single Blurry Image using Unsupervised   Ordering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01686)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train a model to recover a video sequence from a single blurry image, when there is inherent ambiguity in the ordering of the recovered frames?The key points are:- Image-to-video deblurring (recovering a sharp video from a blurry image) is an important and challenging task. - A major issue is the ambiguity in the ordering of the recovered frames, since both forward and reverse sequences are valid solutions given the blurry input.- Existing methods rely on order-invariant losses during training, but this does not fully resolve the issue.- This paper proposes a new method called HyperCUT to assign an explicit ordering to the recovered sequences, avoiding the ambiguity problem. - HyperCUT maps sequences to a latent space such that forward and reverse sequences are separable by a hyperplane. The side of this "HyperCUT" hyperplane defines the sequence order.- This allows imposing constraints during training to produce sequences following a consistent order.- They also introduce a new real-image dataset called RB2V for this task, across three domains (street, face, hand).In summary, the key hypothesis is that assigning an explicit ordering to recovered sequences can help train better models for the ambiguous image-to-video deblurring task. The HyperCUT method is proposed to achieve this.
