# [Decoding Compressed Trust: Scrutinizing the Trustworthiness of Efficient   LLMs Under Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Compressing large language models (LLMs) is an important way to make them more efficient and deployable on consumer devices. However, the impact of compression techniques like quantization and pruning on the trustworthiness of LLMs is not well understood. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of three leading LLMs (LLAMA, Vicuna, ChatLLAMA) compressed with five state-of-the-art techniques. The models are evaluated across eight trustworthiness benchmarks covering dimensions like fairness, privacy, ethics, robustness, etc.

Key Insights:
- Quantization is more effective than pruning for retaining trustworthiness at similar compression rates. A 4-bit quantized model has similar trust scores as the original.

- Moderate quantization (4 bits) can unexpectedly improve trust dimensions like fairness and ethics over the original model. But extreme quantization (3 bits) significantly reduces trust.

- Compressed models can outperform larger counterparts on some trust benchmarks. But alignment appears important for this effect.

- The calibration data used in compression introduces variance in trust scores. So comprehensive evaluation before deployment is essential.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale analysis of the impact of compression techniques on LLM trustworthiness.

- Identification of optimal compression rates for maximizing efficiency and trust simultaneously.

- Revealing unique gains and losses induced by compression along different trust dimensions.

- Providing recommendations and best practices for deploying compressed yet trustworthy LLMs.

The key insight is that compression techniques like quantization have a nuanced impact on LLM trustworthiness - moderately compressed models can be similarly or even more trustworthy than dense counterparts. But the highest compression rates significantly reduce trust, necessitating careful selection and evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively evaluates the trustworthiness of leading large language models compressed by state-of-the-art techniques across eight dimensions, finding an intricate interplay between efficiency, utility, and reliability while offering insights into jointly achieving high performance in all three.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to understanding the trustworthiness of compressed large language models:

1) It provides the first comprehensive evaluation of leading LLMs compressed with state-of-the-art techniques across eight trustworthiness dimensions. This analysis reveals intricate relationships between compression and trustworthiness.

2) The experiments compare paths to efficient 7B-sized models, including pre-training from scratch versus compressing larger (13B) models. Key findings show quantization effectively matches the original model's trustworthiness, while pruning significantly degrades performance.  

3) Exploring high compression rates empirically determines optimal rates for maximizing efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously. Interestingly, moderate quantization unexpectedly improves certain dimensions like ethics and fairness.

4) Evaluating extreme compression cases (e.g. 3-bit quantization) uncovers hidden risks across multiple trust dimensions, even for advanced algorithms. This highlights the imperative of comprehensive benchmarking before deployment.

5) The analysis culminates in practical recommendations for achieving utility, efficiency and trustworthiness together through compression. This "bag of tricks" aims to guide the development of reliable and efficient LLMs going forward.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous, multifaceted analysis demystifying and providing guidance on the complex interplay between efficiency and trust in compressed LLMs.
