# [Removing Undesirable Concepts in Text-to-Image Generative Models with   Learnable Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image generative models trained on large internet datasets can learn and generate undesirable concepts such as racism, violence, and nudity. Erasing such concepts from pre-trained models is challenging as the parameter space is shared between concepts. Erasing one concept often significantly impacts semantically related concepts as well. Prior erasure methods are ineffective in simultaneously erasing undesirable concepts while preserving other unrelated concepts.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method called KPOP that incorporates an additional learnable parameter prompt into the cross-attention layers of pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion. This prompt serves as extra memory to capture the knowledge of undesirable concepts, reducing their dependency on model parameters and input text. KPOP involves two alternating processes - knowledge transfer and knowledge removal. 

In knowledge transfer, the prompt is trained to generate undesirable concepts, transferring their knowledge from model parameters into the prompt. In knowledge removal, aided by the prompt, the model is fine-tuned to map outputs of undesirable concepts close to neutral outputs, thereby erasing them. A regularization term ensures minimal impact on unrelated concepts. The prompt allows erased concepts to be recovered using it as a hidden key.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces prompt-based selective unlearning to minimize negative impact on unrelated concepts during concept erasure
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in erasing objects, nudity, artistic styles while preserving other concepts 
- Provides insights into prompt's behavior in capturing erased concepts and model's stability 
- Demonstrates the flexibility of concatenative prompting mechanism and its scalability w.r.t prompt size
- Establishes the ability to recover erased concepts using the prompt as a backdoor key

The paper demonstrates the promise of prompt-based selective unlearning for safer deployment of foundation models. Exploring more complex prompting mechanisms is highlighted as future work.
