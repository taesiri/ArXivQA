# [Backpropagation-Based Analytical Derivatives of EKF Covariance for   Active Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Robot state estimation can be improved by planning optimal sensor trajectories that minimize the uncertainty in the estimates. However, computing the derivatives of the final estimation error covariance matrix w.r.t. the control inputs for trajectory optimization is computationally demanding.

- Prior works have used finite differences or automatic differentiation, but analytical derivatives are preferable to avoid numerical errors and for better computational efficiency. However, deriving analytical equations was considered difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- This paper derives novel analytical backpropagation equations to compute the gradient of any loss function based on the final covariance matrix of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) w.r.t. all its inputs including control variables. 

- The key insight is to view the EKF equations over a horizon as function compositions and leverage matrix calculus and chain rule to derive backward propagation formulas.

- This analytical gradient computation has similar cost to running just one EKF over the horizon and allows jointly computing gradients w.r.t. all control inputs.

Main Contributions:
- Mathematical derivation of closed-form analytical backpropagation equations for EKF covariance matrix gradients.

- Application to efficient perception-aware robot trajectory optimization by minimizing a loss function of the final EKF covariance matrix.

- Validation in simulations showing trajectory optimization for robot calibration. Computation time comparisons demonstrate benefit over finite differences and automatic differentiation.

- Demonstration on real-world experiments with a large off-road vehicle, showcasing localization accuracy improvements from perception-aware planning.

In summary, the key innovation is the analytical backpropagation formulas for EKF covariance gradients, enabling efficient trajectory optimization for active perception. This is validated through simulations and real-world experiments.
