# [Deciphering Compatibility Relationships with Textual Descriptions via   Extraction and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11554)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding compatibility relationships between fashion items and generating natural language explanations for those relationships is challenging. 
- Existing models can make outfit recommendations but often lack the ability to provide good explanations that accurately convey why two items match well together.  
- Explanations tend to be basic, repetitive and fail to capture the nuances of fashion item compatibility.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new dataset called Pair Fashion Explanation (PFE) with over 6,000 sentences explaining compatibility between pairs of fashion items.
- Proposes a two-stage pipeline model that leverages the PFE dataset:
    - Stage 1 trains an feature extractor on a large general dataset to identify important matching features between item pairs 
    - Stage 2 fine-tunes a language model on PFE to generate explanations conditioned on extracted features

Key Contributions:
- Curates the first dataset designed specifically for explaining pairwise fashion item compatibility 
- Develops an innovative two-stage pipeline that can generate knowledgeable, accurate and informative natural language explanations reflecting true compatibility relationships
- Experiments show the model produces better explanations than baseline recommendation models and general language models, even rivaling ChatGPT's performance

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in explanation generation for fashion outfit recommendations, including a purpose-built dataset and a two-stage approach that combines feature extraction with language model fine-tuning to produce high-quality explanations.
