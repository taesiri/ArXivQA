# [3D-Speaker: A Large-Scale Multi-Device, Multi-Distance, and   Multi-Dialect Corpus for Speech Representation Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How can a large-scale multi-dimensional speech corpus help advance research on disentangling different types of information in speech signals (e.g. speaker identity, content, dialect, recording conditions)?The key points are:- Disentangling uncorrelated information in speech is an important research problem, with applications like speaker verification, speech recognition, etc. - Previous datasets are limited in size and diversity to support this research. - The paper introduces 3D-Speaker, a large corpus of over 10,000 speakers recorded simultaneously by multiple devices, at multiple distances, and in multiple dialects. - The multi-dimensional nature of the data is intended to provide a diverse blend of speech entanglement that can motivate new methods to untangle different speech attributes.- They present benchmarks on speaker verification tasks using the multi-device, multi-distance, and multi-dialect aspects of the data.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a large-scale diverse corpus like 3D-Speaker can drive new research and methods for disentangling speech representations. The multi-dimensional structure provides explicit entanglement that methods could aim to untangle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Introduction of 3D-Speaker, a large-scale speech corpus designed to facilitate research on speech representation disentanglement. The corpus contains over 10,000 speakers recorded simultaneously by multiple devices, from varying distances, and some in multiple dialects. - The controlled combinations of multi-dimensional audio data in 3D-Speaker yield diverse entanglement of speech representations, motivating new methods to untangle them.- 3D-Speaker is suitable for evaluating large universal speech models and experimenting with out-of-domain and self-supervised learning methods. - To the authors' knowledge, 3D-Speaker is the largest publicly available corpus in terms of number of speakers, which can help improve speaker verification and other speech tasks.- Baseline benchmarks are provided for tasks including cross-device, cross-distance, and cross-dialect speaker verification, as well as dialect identification.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of the large and diverse 3D-Speaker corpus to facilitate research on disentangling speech representations and advancing speech-related fields.
