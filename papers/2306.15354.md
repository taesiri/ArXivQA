# [3D-Speaker: A Large-Scale Multi-Device, Multi-Distance, and   Multi-Dialect Corpus for Speech Representation Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How can a large-scale multi-dimensional speech corpus help advance research on disentangling different types of information in speech signals (e.g. speaker identity, content, dialect, recording conditions)?The key points are:- Disentangling uncorrelated information in speech is an important research problem, with applications like speaker verification, speech recognition, etc. - Previous datasets are limited in size and diversity to support this research. - The paper introduces 3D-Speaker, a large corpus of over 10,000 speakers recorded simultaneously by multiple devices, at multiple distances, and in multiple dialects. - The multi-dimensional nature of the data is intended to provide a diverse blend of speech entanglement that can motivate new methods to untangle different speech attributes.- They present benchmarks on speaker verification tasks using the multi-device, multi-distance, and multi-dialect aspects of the data.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a large-scale diverse corpus like 3D-Speaker can drive new research and methods for disentangling speech representations. The multi-dimensional structure provides explicit entanglement that methods could aim to untangle.
