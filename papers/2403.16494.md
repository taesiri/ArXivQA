# [CT-Bound: Fast Boundary Estimation From Noisy Images Via Hybrid   Convolution and Transformer Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating boundary structures from noisy images is challenging, as current solutions either produce low-quality boundary maps or require very long processing times to search for a good result. This is a problem for applications like medical imaging, manufacturing inspection, autonomous navigation, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CT-Bound, a fast deep neural network for image boundary estimation on noisy images. The key ideas are:

1) Decompose boundary estimation into two tasks - local boundary detection and global boundary regularization. This is done using a hybrid Convolutional and Transformer neural network.

2) The convolutional network detects local boundaries from image patches. It has a small receptive field so it can be trained on synthetic data and generalizes to real images.

3) The transformer network refines the boundary estimations globally to ensure consistency, without accessing the image. This makes it very efficient.

Main Contributions:

- A two-stage hybrid ConvNet and Transformer network architecture for boundary estimation.

- The model is 100x faster than previous best method (iterative Field-of-Junctions solver) while achieving comparable accuracy.

- Thorough experiments on synthetic and real noisy images show the model is robust. It can generalize to real images without fine-tuning.

- Model outputs high quality boundary maps and color maps. It can run in real-time (>10 fps) on video data.

In summary, the key novelty is the network design and training strategy to effectively decompose boundary estimation into detection and regularization. This results in an efficient model that achieves both high accuracy and speed.
