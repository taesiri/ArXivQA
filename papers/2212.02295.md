# [Block Selection Method for Using Feature Norm in Out-of-distribution   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02295)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question/hypothesis addressed in this paper is:

Can the norm of the feature map from a suitable block in a neural network be used as an effective indicator for out-of-distribution detection? 

The authors reveal that the norm of the feature map obtained from certain blocks, other than just the last block, can provide good separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. They hypothesize that by selecting the right block and using the norm of its feature map, they can build an effective out-of-distribution detection framework.

To summarize, the main hypothesis is that the norm of the feature map from a suitable block can serve as a good indicator to distinguish in-distribution vs out-of-distribution inputs for neural networks. The paper proposes and evaluates a method to identify and leverage such a suitable block.
