# [Block Selection Method for Using Feature Norm in Out-of-distribution   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02295)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question/hypothesis addressed in this paper is:

Can the norm of the feature map from a suitable block in a neural network be used as an effective indicator for out-of-distribution detection? 

The authors reveal that the norm of the feature map obtained from certain blocks, other than just the last block, can provide good separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. They hypothesize that by selecting the right block and using the norm of its feature map, they can build an effective out-of-distribution detection framework.

To summarize, the main hypothesis is that the norm of the feature map from a suitable block can serve as a good indicator to distinguish in-distribution vs out-of-distribution inputs for neural networks. The paper proposes and evaluates a method to identify and leverage such a suitable block.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a simple out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework consisting of FeatureNorm (norm of feature map) and NormRatio (ratio of FeatureNorm for ID and OOD). 

- It demonstrates that the norm of the feature map from a suitable block can effectively separate ID and OOD samples. The suitable block is selected by NormRatio calculated using ID data and pseudo-OOD generated from ID data.

- It shows empirically that using FeatureNorm from the selected block outperforms existing OOD detection methods on CIFAR10 and ImageNet benchmarks, reducing FPR95 by up to 52.77% and 48.53% respectively.

- It provides analysis on the effectiveness of NormRatio for block selection, the behavior of FeatureNorm through blocks, and the effect of batch normalization on OOD detection. 

- It shows that replacing norm of the last block with norm of the selected block can improve calibration and OOD detection performance of existing methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a simple yet effective OOD detection framework utilizing FeatureNorm and NormRatio, and demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across architectures and datasets. The analysis provides useful insights on leveraging feature norms for OOD detection.
