# [Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Controller   Synchronization in Distributed SDN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Distributed SDN controllers must be synchronized to maintain a centralized network view, but full synchronization is costly. The paper examines the challenge of developing an efficient synchronization policy under the "eventual consistency" model.
- Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) apps are compute-intensive and delay-sensitive. Offloading tasks to edge servers can meet demands, but latency and cost must be balanced.  

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the synchronization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Use reinforcement learning to approximate optimal policy.
- Evaluate both value-based (DQN, DDQN) and policy-based (REINFORCE, PPO) algorithms.
- Primary goal is to minimize network costs by efficient server allocation, while meeting AR/VR latency constraints.

Key Contributions:
- First implementation of policy-based RL for distributed SDN synchronization in dynamic networks.
- Evaluation across multiple apps (AR/VR offloading, shortest path routing) and network configurations.  
- Value-based methods optimize single metrics better (cost, latency).
- Policy-based methods exhibit greater robustness to sudden network changes.
- PPO demonstrates effectiveness closest to value-based methods.
- Framework is adaptable to optimize different network objectives under various constraints.

In summary, the paper tackles synchronization for distributed SDN controllers using RL to meet application demands. Both value and policy-based DRL methods are explored, with relative advantages assessed across dynamic network scenarios and objectives. The framework shows promise in balancing key network metrics under constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper develops and evaluates deep reinforcement learning techniques, including both value-based and policy-based algorithms, for synchronizing distributed SDN controllers under latency constraints to enable efficient augmented reality task offloading while minimizing network costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Tackling the challenge of developing a synchronization policy in SDN environments to ensure latency constraints and minimize network operator costs by strategically offloading tasks to edge servers. 

2. Showing that policy-based DRL methods (specifically PPO) are superior in learning and converging faster to optimal synchronization policies when undergoing abrupt and significant network changes or reconfigurations, compared to value-based methods. The authors claim they are the first to implement policy-based RL algorithms for synchronizing distributed SDN controllers in dynamic networks.

3. Evaluating their DRL framework in additional SDN applications like shortest path routing. Their results demonstrate that value-based methods (specifically DDQN) surpass policy-based approaches in effectively determining the optimal number of network paths and server allocations.  

4. Evaluating the robustness and adaptability of their DRL framework across a range of network conditions by altering the number of data and control plane devices, edge servers, background traffic and server operational costs.

In summary, the main contribution is using DRL for the controller synchronization problem in SDN, and showing that policy-based methods are more robust to sudden network changes while value-based methods optimize metrics better in static settings.
