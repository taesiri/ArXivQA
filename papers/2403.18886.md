# [Self-Expansion of Pre-trained Models with Mixture of Adapters for   Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Self-Expansion of Pre-trained Models with Mixture of Adapters for Continual Learning":

Problem:
Continual learning aims to learn incrementally from a stream of data without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Existing methods utilize fixed sets of adapters or prompts for fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs), which have limited flexibility and may still suffer from catastrophic forgetting due to task interference on shared parameters. The reliance on static model architectures fails to accommodate unpredictable changes in data distribution and scale in continual learning.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes SEMA, a novel approach for continual learning based on self-expansion of pre-trained ViT models using modularized adapters. SEMA can automatically decide to reuse existing adapters or add new task-specific adapters on-demand, depending on whether significant distribution shifts are detected across transformer layers. 

Specifically, each modular adapter consists of a functional adapter for feature generation and a representation descriptor implemented with an autoencoder for capturing task-relevant feature distributions. The representation descriptor serves as an indicator for distribution shifts to trigger adapter expansion when novel patterns occur. An expandable weighting router is introduced to dynamically mix adapter outputs. Compared to existing fixed or task-wise adapter/prompt expansion methods, SEMA achieves superior flexibility and mitigates forgetting by adding lightweight adapters exclusively for novel distributions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of SEMA, a self-expanding modularized adaptation approach for continual learning without rehearsal
- Design of modular adapters containing functional adapters and representation descriptors for controlled expansion
- Introduction of expandable weighting router for mixture usage of adapters
- Significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on vision benchmarks while adding fewer parameters

The main advantage of SEMA lies in its capability to automatically expand itself by inserting adapters tailored to novel distributions on-demand, preventing overwriting previously learned knowledge while retaining performance on old tasks. The carefully designed adapters, routing mechanism and expansion strategy contribute to both effectiveness and efficiency demonstrated by extensive experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SEMA, a novel continual learning approach that enables self-expansion of pre-trained models with modularized adapters by automatically adding adapters at specific layers when detecting distribution shifts, for accommodating new patterns in downstream tasks while retaining performance on old tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel continual learning approach via self-expansion of pre-trained models with modularized adapters, called SEMA. Specifically:

- It learns and reuses modules, while adding new adapters at specific layers exclusively for samples with new patterns, in an automated way without the need for rehearsal. 

- To achieve this, the approach involves crafting modular adapters comprising a functional adapter and a representation descriptor. The representation descriptor captures the distribution of pertinent input features, serving as a signal generator for expansion during training. An expandable weighting router is introduced for adapter mixture.

- Extensive experiments were performed to verify the performance and scrutinize the behavior of the proposed self-expansion approach. The results demonstrate its outstanding performance in accommodating downstream tasks with various data distributions, while mitigating the forgetting problem.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an automated and efficient way to expand pre-trained vision models in a continual learning setting by adding adapters on-demand, without forgetting previously learned knowledge. This is achieved via novel components like modular adapters, representation descriptors, and expandable weighting routers.

The paper proposes a self-expansion approach called SEMA for continually fine-tuning vision transformer models by modularly adding adapters when distribution shifts are detected, without the need for memory replay. Key ideas include using autoencoders as representation descriptors to detect distribution shifts and trigger expansion signals, expanding weighting routers to mix adapter outputs, and freezing adapters after training to enable modular reuse and alleviate forgetting. The method aims to be parameter-efficient by only expanding capacity when needed to handle new distributions. The key terms reflect these core ideas related to the continual learning of vision transformers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using autoencoders as "representation descriptors" to capture the feature distribution relevant to each adapter module. How does using an autoencoder for this purpose compare to using other density estimation techniques like kernel density estimation or Gaussian mixture models? What are the tradeoffs?

2. When adding new adapters, the method freezes previously trained adapters to prevent catastrophic forgetting. However, could allowing some fine-tuning of existing adapters better facilitate transfer learning to new tasks? How could this be implemented without causing significant forgetting?

3. The expandable weighting router is used to combine and weight the outputs of different adapters. Could different router architectures like attention or gating improve performance compared to the simple linear layer? What are the computational tradeoffs?  

4. The method allows adding new adapters at arbitrary transformer layers when distribution shifts are detected. Is adding adapters primarily at later layers optimal? Or could adding more adapters at earlier layers improve feature representation and discrimination ability?

5. The reconstruction error statistics of the autoencoders are used to detect distribution shifts for triggering adapter expansion. What other statistics or metrics could also indicate novelty and improve the expansion trigger mechanism?

6. How sensitive is the performance of the method to the choice of expansion threshold for the z-scores? Could an adaptive threshold setting based on task complexity or dataset statistics improve robustness?

7. The method relies on the task identity being provided during training. How could the approach be extended to a class-incremental scenario without explicit task identities?

8. How does the computational overhead of the autoencoder representation descriptors compare to the cost of the adapter modules themselves? Could more lightweight alternatives provide similar novelty detection ability?

9. Error analysis - what types of distribution shifts or new tasks does the method fail on? When does relying on modular adapters break down compared to retraining parts of the model?

10. The adapters focus on modifying the feedforward layers of ViT. Could similar modular approaches be developed to adapt the self-attention layers? What challenges would this entail?
