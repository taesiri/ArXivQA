# [Multilingual Brain Surgeon: Large Language Models Can be Compressed   Leaving No Language Behind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for compressing large language models (LLMs) rely on calibration data in a single language (usually English) to determine parameter importance. This leads to significant performance drops, especially for low-resource languages. 

- The paper studies two key factors affecting multilingual LLM compression:
    1) Proportion of a language in the training data: Languages with smaller proportion suffer greater performance drops after compression
    2) Similarity between languages: Using calibration data from a language very different than the evaluation language leads to larger performance drops

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS), a novel calibration data sampling technique for compressing multilingual LLMs

- MBS samples calibration data from different languages proportional to their distribution in the training data of the multilingual LLM

- This allows approxmating the overall Hessian matrix of the error function better and guides compression to minimize performance loss across languages

Key Contributions:

- Proposes first calibration data sampling technique specifically for compressing multilingual LLMs that aims to maintain performance across languages

- Shows MBS enhances existing compression techniques like pruning and quantization by sampling proportional calibration data 

- Reveals dynamics of language similarity and training data proportions on compression through extensive experiments

- Theory and experiments provide better understanding of language interactions during LLM compression

- Simple yet effective solution that improves inclusivity of model compression and alleviates the curse of multilinguality

In summary, the paper identifies key limitations of existing LLM compression methods in the multilingual setting and proposes MBS, an innovative calibration data sampling approach that maintains language coverage and capabilities after compression. The insights on language interactions further guide development of more inclusive model compression algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS), a novel calibration data sampling method that improves the performance of compressing multilingual large language models by proportionally sampling data from different languages based on their distribution in the training set.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new calibration data sampling method called Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS) for compressing multilingual large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, MBS samples calibration data from different languages proportionally to the language distribution in the training data of the multilingual LLM. This helps address the limitation of previous compression methods that use only English calibration data, which causes significant performance drops for non-English languages in the model. 

By sampling calibration data proportionally from multiple languages, MBS is able to effectively compress multilingual LLMs while preserving performance across languages, especially for lower-resource languages. The paper demonstrates this through experiments on the BLOOM multilingual LLM, showing improved results compared to English-only calibration data.

In summary, the key innovation is using proportional multi-language calibration data for compressing multilingual LLMs in order to minimize performance degradation and language bias, leaving no language behind after compression.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS): The proposed method to sample calibration data from different languages proportional to the language distribution in the training data. This aims to improve model compression for multilingual large language models.

- Model Compression (MC): Techniques like pruning and quantization to reduce the size of large neural network models while maintaining performance. 

- Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS): A classic network pruning technique that approximates the impact of removing parameters using the Hessian matrix. MBS follows a similar framework.

- Hessian Matrix: The matrix of second-order partial derivatives of the model's error function. Used to determine parameter importance in OBS and related methods.  

- Language Similarity: The authors analyze how similarity between the calibration language and other languages impacts performance after compression. More similar languages retain better performance.

- Multilingual Models: Models like BLOOM that are trained on text datasets covering many languages to learn universal representations.  

- Low-Resource Languages: Languages with smaller amounts of training data, which tend to be more impacted by existing compression techniques. MBS aims to alleviate this.

In summary, the key focus is improving compression techniques like quantization and pruning for multilingual large language models by better approximating parameter importance across languages. The proposed MBS method samples proportional calibration data from different languages.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS) method proposed in the paper:

1) How does MBS address the limitation of existing compression methods that use only English calibration data, leading to significant performance drops for low-resource languages in multilingual models? What is the key insight behind the MBS approach?

2) The paper discusses two main factors that impact language performance after compression - proportion in the training data and similarity between languages. Can you explain the theoretical reasoning behind why these two factors matter? 

3) The concept of language similarity is interesting. Can you explain in more detail how the cosine similarity metric was calculated between language vector representations and why this metric was chosen over alternatives?

4) The paper showed improved results on perplexity and zero-shot evaluations from using MBS. What further evaluations could be done to assess the effectiveness of MBS more thoroughly across languages?

5) How exactly does MBS determine the proportion of calibration data to sample from each language? Walk through the calculations involved step-by-step. 

6) Could MBS be applied successfully during quantization-aware training instead of only post-training quantization? What modifications might need to be made?

7) The paper focused on the BLOOM model. What architectural properties of other multilingual models like mT5, XLM-R etc. might affect the applicability of MBS?

8) What other criteria, besides proportion in training data and similarity, could be incorporated into the MBS sampling strategy to further optimize language retention after compression?

9) The paper briefly mentions Equal MBS. How does this variant compare to the normal MBS approach? When might Equal MBS be preferred?

10) The paper demonstrates MBS for pruning and quantization. Can you conceptually extend the use of proportional language-wise calibration data to other compression techniques like distillation, low-rank approximation etc? What challenges might exist?
