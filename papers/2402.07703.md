# [Online Sequential Decision-Making with Unknown Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of online sequential decision-making when there are unknown delays in receiving feedback. Specifically, in many real-world scenarios like portfolio management and web ranking, there is often a gap between when a decision is made and when the feedback/reward for that decision is received. Furthermore, the delays can be variable and unknown ahead of time. 

Existing algorithms for online convex optimization assume immediate feedback and fail to address these delays. A few recent works have studied fixed known delays or used specific algorithms limited to the Euclidean norm.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes three families of online learning algorithms that can handle different types of delayed feedback under general norms:

1. Follow the Delayed Regularized Leader (FTDRL): Handles full function feedback with delays. Proposed variants for general convex and strongly convex functions.

2. Delayed Mirror Descent (DMD): Handles gradient feedback with delays. Proposed variants use approximate solutions and Bregman divergence for optimization.

3. Simplified Delayed Mirror Descent (SDMD): Handles value information of gradient feedback.

The algorithms use regularization functions and norms tailored for the specific optimization problem. Approximate solutions help reduce computational complexity.

Main Contributions:

- First algorithms for delayed feedback that work for general norms, not just Euclidean  

- Targeted algorithms for full, gradient and value feedback with rigorous analysis

- Flexibility in using regularization and norms suited to problem - showed gains on probability simplex  

- Established sublinear and logarithmic regret bounds comparable to prior art

- Provided several examples demonstrating performance gains compared to baselines

The paper significantly expands the applicability of online learning algorithms to practical delayed feedback settings using approximate solutions and customizable regularization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes three families of online learning algorithms to handle delayed feedback in sequential decision-making problems, utilizing approximate solutions and universal norms to address different types of loss functions and convexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper proposes three families of online learning algorithms (FTDRL, DMD, SDMD) to handle delayed feedback in sequential decision making problems. These algorithms can deal with different types of feedback - full function information, gradient information, and value information of gradients.

2. The proposed algorithms are versatile as they can work with different norms, not just the Euclidean norm. Examples are provided for the probability simplex and p-norm settings.

3. The algorithms only require an approximate solution at each step rather than an exact optimizer. This makes them more practical for real-world iterative optimization problems. 

4. Regret bounds are provided for both general convex and relative strongly convex loss functions. The bounds match existing results in the standard (non-delayed) setting.

5. Comparisons show the proposed methods outperform prior algorithms like DOGD and DOGD-SC that rely on Euclidean projections. The regret bounds also scale better with things like dimensions in some cases.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing more flexible and practical delayed online learning algorithms that work across different loss function classes, norms, and information types.

The paper proposes three families of algorithms - Follow the Delayed Regularized Leader (FTDRL), Delayed Mirror Descent (DMD), and Simplified Delayed Mirror Descent (SDMD) - to handle delayed feedback in online sequential decision-making problems. The algorithms are designed to work with different types of feedback (full function information, gradient information, value information) and different settings (general convexity, relative strong convexity).

The analysisprovides regret bounds in the various settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three families of algorithms (FTDRL, DMD, SDMD) to handle different types of delayed feedback (full function information, gradient information, gradient value information). What motivated the need to design targeted algorithms based on feedback type rather than relying solely on gradient-based methods? 

2. A key aspect of the proposed algorithms is the use of an approximate optimization step rather than requiring an exact solution. What are the tradeoffs of this approximate approach? Under what conditions would an exact solution be necessary or preferred?

3. The regret analysis handles decomposition into a normal term and delayed term. What complications arise in the regret analysis from using an approximate optimization approach compared to prior work? How did the paper address these challenges?

4. How does the use of a generalized regularization function and relative strong convexity notion allow the methods to work across different norms? What specific examples were provided to showcase this?

5. The FTDRL algorithms seem computationally more complex than DMD and SDMD since they require optimizing the loss function history. What approaches help mitigate this additional complexity? When would FTDRL be preferred over the other methods?

6. For the delayed gradient feedback, how does the paper argue DMD and SDMD achieve bounds comparable to FTDRL with full function feedback? What allows SDMD to work effectively even with less information than DMD?

7. When applied to specific examples like the probability simplex, how do the regret bounds compare to prior gradient-based methods? What causes these improvements?

8. The decreasing learning rate used in DMD-RSC and SDMD-RSC depends on the cumulative number of observed feedback instances. What is the intuition behind this choice compared to depending on the number of iterations T?

9. If the maximum delays $d_t$ and total delays $D_T$ are unknown, how can the doubling trick be used so the algorithms still work effectively? What is the impact on permitted optimization errors?

10. For practical implementation, what data structure would you suggest to track which delayed feedback has been received and still needs to be applied when updating the optimization? How can this be updated efficiently as new delays arrive?
