# [Online Sequential Decision-Making with Unknown Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of online sequential decision-making when there are unknown delays in receiving feedback. Specifically, in many real-world scenarios like portfolio management and web ranking, there is often a gap between when a decision is made and when the feedback/reward for that decision is received. Furthermore, the delays can be variable and unknown ahead of time. 

Existing algorithms for online convex optimization assume immediate feedback and fail to address these delays. A few recent works have studied fixed known delays or used specific algorithms limited to the Euclidean norm.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes three families of online learning algorithms that can handle different types of delayed feedback under general norms:

1. Follow the Delayed Regularized Leader (FTDRL): Handles full function feedback with delays. Proposed variants for general convex and strongly convex functions.

2. Delayed Mirror Descent (DMD): Handles gradient feedback with delays. Proposed variants use approximate solutions and Bregman divergence for optimization.

3. Simplified Delayed Mirror Descent (SDMD): Handles value information of gradient feedback.

The algorithms use regularization functions and norms tailored for the specific optimization problem. Approximate solutions help reduce computational complexity.

Main Contributions:

- First algorithms for delayed feedback that work for general norms, not just Euclidean  

- Targeted algorithms for full, gradient and value feedback with rigorous analysis

- Flexibility in using regularization and norms suited to problem - showed gains on probability simplex  

- Established sublinear and logarithmic regret bounds comparable to prior art

- Provided several examples demonstrating performance gains compared to baselines

The paper significantly expands the applicability of online learning algorithms to practical delayed feedback settings using approximate solutions and customizable regularization.
