# [eP-ALM: Efficient Perceptual Augmentation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11403)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently adapt unimodal pretrained models (e.g. large language models and visual encoders) to multimodal tasks like visual question answering and image/video/audio captioning without large amounts of multimodal pretraining data or fine-tuning many parameters. Specifically, the paper investigates augmenting language models with perception by freezing most parameters and only training a small number of adaptation parameters (e.g. a linear projection layer and soft prompt).

The key hypothesis is that it is possible to devise very efficient approaches, in terms of number of trainable parameters, training data, and compute, to adapt existing unimodal models for multimodal tasks by better aligning the visual and language representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposes eP-ALM, an efficient approach to adapt large language models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks by augmenting them with perception. 

- Introduces a new challenging setup for adapting pretrained unimodal models to multimodal tasks that favors training and inference efficiency. The setup avoids multimodal pretraining, uses only unimodal encoders, freezes most parameters, and keeps fast inference.

- Shows that by freezing over 99% of parameters and training only a linear projection layer and soft prompt, eP-ALM can significantly outperform other baselines on image, video and audio-language tasks.

- Demonstrates that eP-ALM is parameter efficient, data efficient, generalizes better out-of-distribution, and scales well with larger language and vision models, reaching 54.5% on VQA v2 while training only 0.06% parameters.

- Validates the effectiveness across multiple modalities (image, video, audio) and tasks like VQA, captioning, visual reasoning, and audio captioning.

In summary, the main contribution is an extremely parameter-efficient approach to adapt large pretrained language models for multimodal tasks by augmenting them with perception from frozen unimodal encoders. This is done through a minimal setup that enables efficient training and inference.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient approach called eP-ALM to adapt pretrained language models for multimodal tasks like VQA and captioning by augmenting them with perceptual context from frozen unimodal vision encoders, demonstrating strong performance while training only a minimal number of parameters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a new method called eP-ALM for efficiently adapting large unimodal language models for multimodal tasks like visual question answering and image/video/audio captioning. Here are some key ways this work compares to other related research:

- Focuses on directly fine-tuning pretrained models on downstream tasks rather than pretraining on large multimodal datasets. This makes the approach more efficient in terms of training data, compute, and time compared to many existing vision-language models that require expensive pretraining.

- Freezes nearly all parameters of the vision and language models (over 99%) and only trains a small linear connection layer and/or soft prompt. This is far more parameter-efficient than methods that fine-tune all parameters or use large adapter modules. 

- Relies solely on unimodal vision models like ViT rather than multimodal models like CLIP that require training on huge image-text datasets. Avoiding this expensive multimodal pretraining improves efficiency.

- Tests image, video, and audio modalities. Most prior work on adapting LMs has focused on images, so exploring multiple modalities is a useful contribution.

- Achieves strong performance on VQA, captioning, etc. with very minimal training. Outperforms other efficient approaches for adapting LMs like PromptFuse and MAGMA.

- Provides useful analysis of model scaling, showing performance gains as language and vision model size increases. This helps demonstrate the potential of the approach when combined with very large models.

Overall, this work pushes towards extremely efficient exploitation of pretrained unimodal models for multimodal tasks. The focus on minimizing trainable parameters, avoiding expensive pretraining, and using only unimodal encoders sets it apart from much prior research and provides a useful data point towards maximizing efficiency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Further investigating the connection between parameter efficiency and data efficiency. The authors show their approach is both parameter and data efficient on VQA, but suggest more research can be done on this relationship for other tasks and modalities. 

- Exploring how to better capture fine-grained details in images. The authors note their approach struggles with capturing details due to only using the [CLS] token from the visual encoder. Using hierarchical visual transformers or other techniques to integrate more fine-grained visual features could help.

- Improving video and audio capabilities by using more advanced video and audio encoders. The authors suggest hierarchical video transformers and exploring different audio encoders could lead to further improvements.

- Scaling to even bigger language and visual models. The authors show consistent improvements by scaling up both modalities and suggest this is a promising direction, especially with models beyond the billions of parameters they tested.

- Adapting the approach to other modalities beyond vision, video and audio. The authors propose their approach can be straightforwardly extended to other modalities.

- Applying the approach to a wider range of downstream tasks beyond VQA and captioning. The authors focus on VQA and captioning but suggest their approach can be adapted for other vision-language tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are improving fine-grained visual understanding, scaling to larger models, extending to more tasks/modalities, and further exploring the connections between parameter and data efficiency. The authors propose their approach as a general framework for efficient multimodal learning that can be built upon in these ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an efficient method to adapt unimodal vision and language models for multimodal tasks. The key idea is to augment a pretrained language model with visual perception by injecting projected visual tokens from a frozen visual encoder into the language model. Specifically, the [CLS] tokens from the last layers of the visual encoder are projected and prepended to the text tokens in the last layers of the language model, allowing cross-modal interaction with minimal overhead. Only the projection layers and optionally a small soft prompt are trained, freezing over 99% of parameters. The approach, dubbed eP-ALM, is shown to outperform other baselines on image, video and audio-text tasks like VQA, captioning and QA while training orders of magnitude fewer parameters. The efficiency of eP-ALM enables leveraging large unimodal models with minimal adaptation cost. The results demonstrate that aligned multimodal representations can emerge from efficient adaptation without full finetuning or multimodal pretraining.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes an efficient approach called eP-ALM for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multimodal tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. The key idea is to augment existing pretrained LLMs with perceptual information from visual encoders by connecting the models via only a small number of trainable parameters. Specifically, they extract the [CLS] tokens from the visual encoder and inject them into the LLM after linear projection. This allows the LLM to generate text conditioned on the visual input while keeping over 99% of the model parameters frozen. The approach trains only the linear connection and a soft prompt, which amounts to less than 1% of total parameters. Without any multimodal pretraining, eP-ALM significantly outperforms prior work that also adapts LLMs but trains more parameters. Experiments across images, videos and audio show eP-ALM attains strong performance while being extremely parameter and data efficient.

The authors propose a challenging setup for efficiently adapting unimodal models to multimodal tasks that avoids costly components like multimodal pretraining, training entire models, and using huge multimodal encoders. Under this setup, they compare eP-ALM to reimplementations of prior work and show it substantially outperforms on tasks like VQA, captioning and QA. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of injecting [CLS] tokens from visual encoders into late LLM layers. As model scale increases, eP-ALM becomes even more effective, achieving 54.5% on VQA v2 while training only 0.06% of parameters. The approach also generalizes well to unseen distributions and is data efficient. The work underscores the potential for extremely efficient adaptation of unimodal models like LLMs to multimodal tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach called eP-ALM to efficiently adapt large pretrained unimodal models for multimodal tasks like visual question answering and image/video/audio captioning. The key idea is to augment a pretrained language model (LM) with perceptual context from frozen pretrained visual/audio encoders by injecting projected classifier tokens ([CLS]) from the encoder into the LM. Specifically, [CLS] tokens from the final layers of the perceptual encoder are projected via learned linear layers and injected into the top layers of the LM by prepending them to the input text tokens. This allows the LM to be conditioned on the perceptual context while keeping almost all parameters frozen. Only the linear projection layers (~1% of params) and an optional small prompt are trained. This parameter-efficient approach significantly outperforms baselines on VQA and captioning tasks across modalities, while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. The method enables leveraging huge pretrained LMs for multimodal tasks without costly pretraining or full finetuning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of efficiently adapting existing unimodal models (specifically large language models) for multimodal tasks like visual question answering and image/video/audio captioning. The key questions it seems to be exploring are:

- Do we need to follow the trend of scaling up models and dataset sizes to solve multimodal tasks, or can we find more efficient ways to adapt existing models? 

- What is the minimal computational effort (in terms of trainable parameters, training data, compute time, etc.) needed to adapt large language models to multimodal tasks?

- How can we best align and merge representations from visual encoders and language models to perform multimodal tasks without a lot of extra training?

- Can techniques like prompt tuning help efficiently adapt language models for multimodal tasks and different modalities (images, video, audio)?

So in summary, it is looking for extremely efficient ways to leverage the power of large pretrained language models for multimodal tasks, while avoiding costly components like end-to-end training, multimodal pretraining datasets, and computationally expensive modules. The goal is to find the sweet spot between efficiency and performance.
