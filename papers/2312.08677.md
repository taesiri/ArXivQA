 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called DropTop for debiasing shortcut learning in online continual learning (OCL). OCL faces challenges from shortcut bias which relies on simple cues and hurts transferability to new tasks. DropTop introduces two novel techniques - attentive debiasing with feature map fusion and adaptive intensity shifting. Attentive debiasing fuses low and high level features to identify shortcut regions for dropping. Adaptive intensity shifting determines the appropriate proportion of features to drop over time based on loss reductions. Without needing prior knowledge or auxiliary data, DropTop automatically handles the varying extent of shortcut bias in online learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with multiple OCL algorithms show DropTop substantially improves average accuracy and forgetting. For example, it increases average accuracy for experience replay by 10.2% on CIFAR-10 and reduces forgetting by 63.2% for a prompt tuning method on ImageNet variants. The consistent gains demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of debiasing shortcuts in online continual learning.
