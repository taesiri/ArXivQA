# [Latent-NeRF for Shape-Guided Generation of 3D Shapes and Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07600)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we generate 3D shapes and textures from text descriptions in a constrained and controlled manner? The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:- Adapting score distillation loss from 2D diffusion models to guide 3D shape generation, leading to an efficient Latent-NeRF model.- Introducing shape guidance constraints to the Latent-NeRF model in two forms:1) Sketch-Mesh guidance - Using a simple abstract 3D mesh to guide the overall shape.2) Latent-Paint - Generating textures directly on a given 3D mesh surface. - Showing these forms of guidance allow controlling the 3D structure and texture generation process based on both text and shape inputs.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that combining latent 3D representations like NeRF with guidance from pre-trained diffusion models and optional shape constraints can enable controlled text-to-3D generation. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing Latent-NeRF, an adaptation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to operate in the latent space of an image diffusion model rather than RGB space. This allows guiding the NeRF generation with an off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion model via score distillation.- Introducing two forms of shape guidance that can be combined with Latent-NeRF:   1) Sketch-Mesh guidance, where a simple abstract 3D mesh guides the shape generation.   2) Latent-Paint, where textures are generated for a given 3D mesh by representing the texture map in the diffusion model's latent space.- Showing that Latent-NeRF training can be more efficient than RGB-NeRF guidance since it avoids encoding to latent space at each step. Latent-NeRF can also be converted to RGB space after training for further refinement.- Demonstrating high-quality 3D shape and texture generation guided by text prompts and explicit shapes, using the proposed Latent-NeRF framework with sketch-mesh and latent-paint guidance.In summary, the key contribution is presenting an efficient latent space framework for generating 3D shapes and textures under varying forms of guidance from text and explicit shapes. This is enabled by adapting NeRFs and score distillation to operate directly in the latent space of a pretrained diffusion model.
