# [Diffusion Model-Based Image Editing: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models and have achieved breakthroughs in image generation and editing tasks compared to previous GAN-based approaches. However, existing surveys on diffusion models focus on other application areas like video generation and image restoration, lacking a comprehensive and focused review of diffusion model-based image editing methods. There is a need for an in-depth analysis to systematically categorize and assess the extensive research in this rapidly advancing field.

Solution: 
This paper conducts an exhaustive survey to offer critical analysis distinctly focused on image editing using diffusion models. It organizes over 100 research papers into three primary classes - training-based, testing-time finetuning, and training & finetuning free approaches. Input conditions explored include text, mask, reference image, class label, layout, pose, sketch, segmentation map, audio, and dragging points. Image editing capabilities are categorized into semantic editing (object/background change, emotion modification), stylistic editing (color/style/texture change), and structural editing (object movement/resize/action/view change).  

An evaluation benchmark EditEval with 50 high-quality images and prompts is introduced. It assesses performance on 7 common editing tasks - object addition/removal/replacement, background replacement, style change, texture change, action change. A new metric LMM Score is proposed to quantify editing accuracy, contextual preservation, visual quality and logical realism. Experiments compare 8+ state-of-the-art methods per task. Challenges like few-step inference, efficient models, complex structure editing, lighting/shadow manipulation, evaluation metrics are discussed.

Contributions:
1) Comprehensive analysis of diffusion model-based image editing literature 
2) Multi-perspective taxonomy covering learning strategies, input conditions, editing capabilities
3) Introduction of EditEval benchmark and LMM Score metric
4) Quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art methods over diverse editing tasks
5) Identification of current limitations and future research directions

The paper offers researchers a structured understanding of progress in this field, providing insights to guide advancement towards more advanced and practical image editing systems using diffusion models.
