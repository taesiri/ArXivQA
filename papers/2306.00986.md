# [Diffusion Self-Guidance for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00986)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can we leverage the rich representations learned inside pretrained diffusion models to enable more fine-grained control over image generation without requiring additional training data or models?The key hypothesis is that properties like object shape, position, size, and appearance can be extracted from the attention maps and activations of a diffusion model and used to meaningfully guide the image sampling process in a zero-shot manner. This could enable challenging image manipulations like moving or resizing objects, combining content from multiple images, or transferring real object appearances into generated scenes.The paper introduces "self-guidance" which constrains diffusion sampling based on these internal representations to steer generation towards images that satisfy certain properties. This allows manipulating images based on constraints that are difficult to specify precisely through text prompts alone.The core idea is that the rich knowledge learned inside large generative models can be tapped into directly, without needing extra supervision or data. This opens up new ways of controlling generation in a highly disentangled yet zero-shot manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing self-guidance, a method to control the internal representations of diffusion models in order to steer the image generation process. This allows controlling properties like object shape, position, and appearance without needing additional models or training data.2. Identifying useful properties that can be extracted from the attention maps and activations of a pretrained diffusion model, such as object size, position, shape, and appearance. 3. Demonstrating that composing these basic properties allows complex image manipulations like changing object positions/sizes, merging layout and appearance between images, compositing multiple objects, and more.4. Showing that self-guidance can also be applied to reconstruct and edit real images by passing them through the diffusion model's denoiser.5. Providing an analysis of the limitations of the approach, such as entanglement between interacting objects in attention space and leakage between appearance and spatial features.In summary, the key innovation is using the internal representations of diffusion models for granular control over image generation, without needing any external models or data. The simple properties identified enable challenging image manipulations in a zero-shot manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces a method called self-guidance that leverages the internal representations of pretrained diffusion models to provide granular control over the shape, position, and appearance of objects in generated images without requiring any additional training data or models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper introduces a new method called "self-guidance" for controlling generated images from diffusion models. This allows modifying properties like object position, size, shape, and appearance in a zero-shot manner without needing extra training data. Other recent work like Plug-and-Play Language Models (PtP) and ControlNet also aim to edit generations, but rely on extra optimizations or fine-tuning that self-guidance avoids.- The manipulations shown, like swapping object appearances and merging image layouts, are more complex than previous zero-shot methods like prompt engineering. The compositionality of the presented approach seems greater than most prior work.- Using attention and activations for control seems to be a novel idea not explored much before. Previous work that leveraged internals focused more on classifier features or CLIP embeddings. Directly utilizing attention for spatial properties is clever.- Extending the method to real images is unique. Most prior work focuses only on generated images. Showing spatial editing like object moving works for real images is an intriguing result.- There appear to be some limitations around entanglement of objects in attention space and appearance leaking layout features. But overall the level of control seems superior to prior approaches.- The method is applied only to a single model, Imagen. Testing on other architectures could better reveal its generality. Exploring other modalities like video could also be interesting future work.Overall, I'd say this paper introduces a simple but surprisingly effective way of steering generation in diffusion models. The editing capabilities and lack of extra training/data seem like clear advantages over related techniques. It moves the state-of-the-art forward in controllable image generation through clever use of model internals.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests the following future research directions:- Exploring alternative formulations and additional properties that could be used for self-guidance. The authors mention that more properties certainly exist beyond the ones they proposed.- Addressing limitations of relying on cross-attention maps, which preclude control over objects not mentioned in the text prompt. The authors suggest selectively applying attention guidance at certain layers/timesteps may allow for better disentanglement of interacting objects.- Mitigating the entanglement of appearance and layout in the model's representations. The authors find appearance features often leak layout information and vice versa, implying hidden correlations the model exploits. Understanding and disentangling these could enable more controls.- Extending the approach to allow shape control when transferring appearance from real images. Currently the method only constrains appearance of objects from real images in generated contexts. Adding shape constraints is noted as useful future work.- Exploring how self-guidance could provide insights into the inner workings of diffusion models, since it exposes hidden capabilities simply through manipulating internal representations. The authors suggest their method could inform future research on these models.- Developing additional techniques to prevent harmful generations, since the controllability of self-guidance could enable problematic image manipulations. Safeguards like embedded watermarks or automated filtering are mentioned.In summary, the main suggested directions are exploring new formulations of self-guidance, disentangling representations more thoroughly, extending capabilities to real images, using the approach to understand diffusion models, and developing safeguards against harmful uses.
