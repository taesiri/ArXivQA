# [Diffusion Self-Guidance for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00986)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can we leverage the rich representations learned inside pretrained diffusion models to enable more fine-grained control over image generation without requiring additional training data or models?The key hypothesis is that properties like object shape, position, size, and appearance can be extracted from the attention maps and activations of a diffusion model and used to meaningfully guide the image sampling process in a zero-shot manner. This could enable challenging image manipulations like moving or resizing objects, combining content from multiple images, or transferring real object appearances into generated scenes.The paper introduces "self-guidance" which constrains diffusion sampling based on these internal representations to steer generation towards images that satisfy certain properties. This allows manipulating images based on constraints that are difficult to specify precisely through text prompts alone.The core idea is that the rich knowledge learned inside large generative models can be tapped into directly, without needing extra supervision or data. This opens up new ways of controlling generation in a highly disentangled yet zero-shot manner.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper introduces a new method called "self-guidance" for controlling generated images from diffusion models. This allows modifying properties like object position, size, shape, and appearance in a zero-shot manner without needing extra training data. Other recent work like Plug-and-Play Language Models (PtP) and ControlNet also aim to edit generations, but rely on extra optimizations or fine-tuning that self-guidance avoids.- The manipulations shown, like swapping object appearances and merging image layouts, are more complex than previous zero-shot methods like prompt engineering. The compositionality of the presented approach seems greater than most prior work.- Using attention and activations for control seems to be a novel idea not explored much before. Previous work that leveraged internals focused more on classifier features or CLIP embeddings. Directly utilizing attention for spatial properties is clever.- Extending the method to real images is unique. Most prior work focuses only on generated images. Showing spatial editing like object moving works for real images is an intriguing result.- There appear to be some limitations around entanglement of objects in attention space and appearance leaking layout features. But overall the level of control seems superior to prior approaches.- The method is applied only to a single model, Imagen. Testing on other architectures could better reveal its generality. Exploring other modalities like video could also be interesting future work.Overall, I'd say this paper introduces a simple but surprisingly effective way of steering generation in diffusion models. The editing capabilities and lack of extra training/data seem like clear advantages over related techniques. It moves the state-of-the-art forward in controllable image generation through clever use of model internals.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following future research directions:- Exploring alternative formulations and additional properties that could be used for self-guidance. The authors mention that more properties certainly exist beyond the ones they proposed.- Addressing limitations of relying on cross-attention maps, which preclude control over objects not mentioned in the text prompt. The authors suggest selectively applying attention guidance at certain layers/timesteps may allow for better disentanglement of interacting objects.- Mitigating the entanglement of appearance and layout in the model's representations. The authors find appearance features often leak layout information and vice versa, implying hidden correlations the model exploits. Understanding and disentangling these could enable more controls.- Extending the approach to allow shape control when transferring appearance from real images. Currently the method only constrains appearance of objects from real images in generated contexts. Adding shape constraints is noted as useful future work.- Exploring how self-guidance could provide insights into the inner workings of diffusion models, since it exposes hidden capabilities simply through manipulating internal representations. The authors suggest their method could inform future research on these models.- Developing additional techniques to prevent harmful generations, since the controllability of self-guidance could enable problematic image manipulations. Safeguards like embedded watermarks or automated filtering are mentioned.In summary, the main suggested directions are exploring new formulations of self-guidance, disentangling representations more thoroughly, extending capabilities to real images, using the approach to understand diffusion models, and developing safeguards against harmful uses.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces self-guidance, a method for controlling image generation in pretrained diffusion models without requiring additional training data or models. Self-guidance works by extracting and constraining properties like object position, size, shape, and appearance from the diffusion model's internal representations during sampling. By composing a small set of these properties, the authors demonstrate challenging image manipulations like moving or resizing objects, copying layout and appearance between images, and compositing objects from multiple images. The paper shows these techniques on both generated and real images, enabling spatial editing of real photos by approximating reverse diffusion sampling using the model's encoder. Overall, self-guidance provides fine-grained control over diffusion sampling and image generation without modification to the pretrained model.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces self-guidance, a method for controlling image generation from diffusion models. Self-guidance guides the model's sampling process by constraining the intermediate activations and attention maps inside the diffusion model itself, without needing any external models or training. The authors show how properties like object position, size, shape, and appearance can be extracted from these internal representations and composed to perform complex image manipulations at test time in a zero-shot manner. For example, self-guidance allows moving or resizing only certain objects in a scene, replacing objects with ones from other images, or combining layout and appearance across images. The method works for both originally generated and real images. Overall, the paper demonstrates how the rich learned representations within diffusion models can enable fine-grained control over image generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a method called "self-guidance" for controlling image generation with diffusion models. Self-guidance leverages the rich representations learned inside diffusion models, namely the intermediate activations and attention maps, to steer attributes of objects and relationships between them. This allows controlling properties like object position, size, shape, and appearance by constraining these internal representations during sampling. The key advantage is that this approach relies only on knowledge already present in pretrained diffusion models, requiring no additional training or external models. The authors demonstrate that composing just a few simple constraints on position, size, shape, and appearance enables challenging image manipulations that are difficult to convey precisely through text prompts alone. Examples include moving or resizing specific objects, merging object appearance between images, rearranging object layouts, and more. Self-guidance can also be used to reconstruct and edit real images by passing them through the diffusion model. Overall, the method provides fine-grained control over generation in a zero-shot manner, without the need for paired training data. The results showcase surprising new capabilities enabled by harnessing information already within diffusion models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces self-guidance, a method to provide more controllable image generation from text-to-image diffusion models. Self-guidance uses the internal representations learned by these models, specifically the attention maps and activations, to steer attributes like the shape, size, position, and appearance of objects mentioned in the text prompt. For example, properties like an object's location or size can be extracted from the attention maps and then constrained during sampling to modify just that object. The appearance of objects can be transferred between images by matching activation patterns. By composing these kinds of terms, the sampling process can be guided to allow complex manipulations like swapping object locations or appearances between images. A key advantage of self-guidance is that it requires no additional training data or models beyond the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model. The authors show that just using a few simple constraints derived from the model's internals allows fine-grained control over challenging image manipulations in a zero-shot manner.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a method called self-guidance for controllable image generation using pretrained diffusion models. The key idea is to leverage the rich intermediate representations learned inside diffusion models, namely the activations and attention maps, to directly control attributes like object shape, position, and appearance during sampling. Specifically, properties like an object's centroid, size, shape, and appearance can be extracted from the model's attention and activation maps and compared to target values to add additional "guidance" terms when sampling. By composing these terms, the sampling process can be steered to manipulate objects in precise ways without changing the rest of the image. For example, object positions and sizes can be directly controlled, appearances can be copied between images, and complex image edits like swapping layouts can be achieved - all in a zero-shot manner without any finetuning. A major advantage is that this approach relies purely on the knowledge already within the pretrained diffusion model rather than requiring external models or data. Experiments demonstrate controllable generation and editing of both generated and real images using self-guidance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is the lack of fine-grained control over image generation using large-scale generative models like diffusion models. While such models can generate high-quality images from text prompts, it is difficult to convey all desired aspects of an image purely through text. The paper introduces a method called "self-guidance" to provide more granular control over image generation by guiding the internal representations of diffusion models during sampling.Specifically, some of the key questions and goals of the paper appear to be:- How can we manipulate specific objects or attributes in a generated image, like changing the position or size of an object, without affecting the rest of the image?- How can we transfer the appearance of an object from one image to another, or combine elements from multiple images into one cohesive generated image?- How can this be done without requiring additional training data or models, and in a zero-shot manner using only the representations learned by a pretrained diffusion model?- Can this approach enable complex image editing capabilities like scene composition, appearance transfer, spatial manipulation of objects, etc. that are difficult to achieve through text prompts alone?- Can this method work not just for images generated by diffusion models, but also for editing real images by utilizing the model's internal representations?So in summary, the key focus is on enabling more detailed control over image generation in diffusion models by exploiting their internal learned representations, without needing additional supervision.
