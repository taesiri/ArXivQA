# [Let's Get It Started: Fostering the Discoverability of New Releases on   Deezer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deezer releases hundreds of thousands of new albums every week. Promptly showcasing this new content to users is important but challenging due to limited information on the new releases.
- Deezer's previous "New releases for you" recommendation carousel relied on manual editor picks and was only partially personalized, limiting catalog coverage and adaptiveness.

Proposed Solution: 
- Developed a cold-start neural embedding model called CF-Cold-Start to predict latent representations of new albums using metadata. This enables personalized new album recommendations from the full catalog as early as the release date.

- Added a contextual bandit model called TS-CF-Cold-Start to balance exploitation and exploration in the "New releases for you" carousel rankings. The bandit explores less popular but promising new albums in addition to exploiting usage-based recommendations.

Main Contributions:
- Fully personalized and adaptive "New releases for you" recommendations powered by predicted new album embeddings, with catalog coverage increased from editor picks to full catalog.

- Introduction of bandits to carousels increased dynamism and exposure for less popular new releases, though performance was similar to the non-bandit variant.

- Online A/B testing showed improved click rates (+6%) and higher numbers of new albums displayed (+3x) and clicked (+1.5x) compared to previous editorial approach.

- Proposed further enhancements like using equity-aware bandits and separating unmissable from discovered albums into two carousels to fully leverage bandit personalization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Deezer's recent efforts to improve the exposure and recommendation of new music releases on their platform through personalized systems involving cold start neural embeddings and contextual bandits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content in the paper, the main contribution is developing and deploying new machine learning systems (CF-Cold-Start and TS-CF-Cold-Start) to improve the recommendations and exposure of new music album releases on the Deezer music streaming platform. Specifically:

1) CF-Cold-Start is a neural network model that generates embedding vector representations to recommend new albums to users even before much usage data is available, helping to address the cold start problem.

2) TS-CF-Cold-Start incorporates a contextual bandit algorithm on top of CF-Cold-Start to balance exploiting recommendations based on usage data and exploring new album recommendations. 

3) Experiments showed CF-Cold-Start increased click rates as well as the number of new albums displayed and clicked in the "New releases for you" carousel recommendations. While the bandit algorithm did not further improve performance, the systems overall enhanced the discoverability of new releases on Deezer.

So in summary, the main contribution is using machine learning, specifically cold-start recommendation and bandits, to improve how new music releases are recommended on a music streaming platform.

New Releases, Music Recommendation, Music Discovery


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a 3-layer neural network in the CF-Cold-Start model to predict embedding vectors for new albums. What were the key inputs and outputs of this neural network? What loss function and optimization technique did they use to train it?

2. The paper states that the CF-Cold-Start model is updated every 4 hours with new usage data on the albums. What is the rationale behind choosing a 4 hour update frequency? What tradeoffs did they likely consider in selecting this timeframe?  

3. The paper compares the performance of the CF-Cold-Start and TS-CF-Cold-Start models. Why does adding Thompson Sampling not lead to better results in this case, when it has been useful in other recommendation scenarios at Deezer?

4. The paper suggests using equity of exposure techniques in future work. What specific algorithms or formulations could help address equity issues when recommending new releases? How might those be integrated with the existing recommendation pipeline?

5. What additional features or metadata beyond what is mentioned could be useful inputs to the CF-Cold-Start model for new albums? For example, text descriptions, album cover images, etc. How might those impact the model performance?

6. The CF-Cold-Start model predicts an entire embedding vector for new albums. What are the tradeoffs between predicting the full vector versus individual vector components? Would a hybrid approach be beneficial?

7. What other neural network architectures could be explored for the CF-Cold-Start model? For example, graph neural networks incorporating artist similarity or temporal convolution networks modeling sequence history.

8. How was the training data for the CF-Cold-Start model constructed from existing albums? What heuristics or data filtering may have been used to build an appropriate dataset?

9. The paper focuses specifically on albums, while mentioning usage for tracks. How might the techniques be adapted or differ for new track recommendations? 

10. How might the systems need to be tailored for different music genres that have varied release cycles or discovery needs? Are there certain genres where this approach is more or less effective?
