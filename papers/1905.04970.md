## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals seem to be:1) To provide cheap-to-evaluate tabular benchmarks for joint architecture and hyperparameter optimization that still represent realistic use cases. 2) To use the benchmarks to gain insight into the properties and difficulty of architecture/hyperparameter optimization problems. This includes analyzing the importance of different hyperparameters and how performance correlates across datasets.3) To rigorously compare various state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods using the benchmarks in terms of performance and robustness.The paper introduces tabular benchmarks based on training and evaluating a large grid of neural network configurations on several regression datasets. These benchmarks aim to facilitate reproducible experiments and evaluation of HPO methods without requiring extensive compute resources. The analysis of the benchmark data provides insights into the optimization problem structure. Finally, the benchmarks are used for an in-depth empirical comparison of HPO algorithms like Bayesian optimization, Hyperband, regularized evolution, etc.In summary, the central goals are: 1) Introduce cheap tabular benchmarks for HPO 2) Understand optimization problem properties using the benchmarks 3) Rigorously compare HPO methods using the benchmarks.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces tabular benchmarks for neural architecture and hyperparameter search that provide a cheap way to evaluate different optimization methods on realistic problems and enable reproducible experiments without requiring extensive compute resources.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search:- The paper introduces new tabular benchmarks for evaluating HPO methods, building on prior work like surrogate benchmarks and NAS-Bench-101. These benchmarks allow for fast and reproducible experiments, addressing the high computational demands of rigorously evaluating HPO methods.- It provides an in-depth analysis of the benchmark datasets, characterizing properties like performance distributions, hyperparameter importance, and correlation across datasets. This offers useful insights about the difficulty of the optimization problem.- The paper benchmarks a variety of HPO algorithms from the literature, including Bayesian optimization, evolutionary methods, bandits, and reinforcement learning. The comparisons yield new insights about performance, sample efficiency, and robustness.- The focus is on optimizing architectures and hyperparameters of feedforward neural networks for tabular/regression datasets. This is a narrower scope than some prior NAS research on convolutional nets for image datasets, but provides a useful testbed.- The configuration space explored is modest, with 4 architectural variables and 5 training hyperparameters. This allows exhaustive evaluation but is far simpler than some large-scale NAS studies.Overall, the paper makes solid contributions in terms of new benchmark datasets, extensive problem characterization, and thorough algorithm comparisons. The analysis is rigorous but the scope is reasonably narrow. The benchmarks and findings help advance research on neural hyperparameter optimization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Generate more tabular benchmarks for other neural network architectures and datasets. The authors mention wanting to create more of these cheap-to-evaluate surrogate benchmarks to facilitate easy and efficient evaluation of HPO methods without requiring large compute resources.- Develop new HPO methods tailored for these tabular benchmarks. The benchmarks provide an easy way to test new HPO algorithms, so the authors hope more methods can be developed and rigorously compared.- Explore multi-task and transfer learning approaches. The authors found correlations in performance rankings across the different datasets, indicating potential for multi-task methods to leverage data from previous optimizations.- Test multi-fidelity HPO algorithms. The full learning curves provide a fidelity measure (number of epochs) that could be used to benchmark multi-fidelity optimzers.- Improve robustness of HPO methods. The authors emphasize the importance of robustness in practice and suggest it needs more focus when developing and evaluating HPO techniques.- Analyze higher-order hyperparameter interactions. The benchmarks showed evidence of higher-order interactions that could not be computed, so new analysis methods may need to be developed.- Optimize meta-parameters of methods like BOHB. Better performance may be possible by tuning meta-parameters like bandwidths that were set to defaults based on different applications.So in summary, the main directions are developing more benchmarks, new HPO methods to leverage them, multi-task and multi-fidelity approaches, improving robustness, and analyzing hyperparameter interactions. The benchmarks are presented as a way to advance HPO research along these lines.
