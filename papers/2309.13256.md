# [Defending Pre-trained Language Models as Few-shot Learners against   Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13256)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to effectively defend pre-trained language models (PLMs) adapted as few-shot learners against textual backdoor attacks?The key points are:- PLMs adapted as few-shot learners via prompting are shown to be vulnerable to textual backdoor attacks, where triggers injected during training cause targeted misclassification at test time. - Defending PLMs in the few-shot learning setting poses unique challenges compared to fine-tuning, due to limited data, computational budgets, and intricate prompt interactions. - Existing textual backdoor defenses designed for fine-tuned models fail to work effectively in the few-shot scenario.- This paper proposes a new defense method called MDP specifically tailored to defend prompt-based PLMs under few-shot learning against such backdoor attacks.- MDP detects poisoned samples by quantifying their higher sensitivity to random masking compared to clean samples, using the limited few-shot data as distributional anchors.- Empirical evaluation shows MDP outperforms baseline defenses by large margins in detecting various backdoor attacks, with little impact on PLM performance.In summary, the core research question is how to defend PLMs adapted as few-shot learners via prompting against backdoor attacks, for which this paper proposes a new tailored defense method MDP.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It conducts a pilot study showing that pre-trained language models (PLMs) as few-shot learners are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks while existing defenses are inadequate. 2. It proposes MDP, a novel lightweight, pluggable, and effective defense tailored for PLMs as few-shot learners. MDP exploits the gap between the masking sensitivity of poisoned and clean samples, and leverages the few-shot data as distributional anchors to effectively estimate such sensitivity for detecting poisoned samples.3. It provides theoretical analysis showing that MDP creates a dilemma for the attacker between attack effectiveness and detection evasiveness. 4. It validates the efficacy of MDP using benchmark datasets and representative attacks. The results show MDP outperforms baseline defenses by large margins while causing little impact on the performance of PLMs in downstream tasks.In summary, this is the first work on defending PLMs as few-shot learners against textual backdoor attacks. It reveals the unique challenges of defending few-shot PLMs, and proposes a tailored defense MDP that is effective, lightweight and pluggable. Theoretical and empirical analysis validate the advantage of MDP over existing defenses. This sheds light on enhancing the security of PLMs under the prompt-based, few-shot learning paradigm.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes MDP, a novel defense method that leverages masking sensitivity differences between clean and poisoned samples to detect backdoor attacks against prompt-based few-shot language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a comparison of this paper to other related research:- This paper focuses specifically on defending pre-trained language models (PLMs) against backdoor attacks in the few-shot learning setting. Most prior work on defending against textual backdoor attacks has focused on fine-tuned models rather than few-shot prompt-based learning. So this represents a new direction in backdoor defense research.- The paper proposes a novel defense method called MDP that detects backdoored samples by measuring the variation in representations when inputs are randomly masked. This is a unique approach compared to prior textual backdoor defenses like STRIP, ONION, and RAP that rely more on prediction changes or perplexity. Leveraging representational changes due to masking is an innovative technique.- The paper shows empirically that MDP significantly outperforms adapted versions of prior textual backdoor defenses like STRIP, ONION, and RAP in the few-shot setting. This demonstrates the need for defenses tailored specifically to few-shot learning rather than just adapting fine-tuning defenses.- The paper provides some theoretical analysis of the inherent tradeoff created by MDP between attack effectiveness and evasion. Analysis of defenses is less common than empirical evaluation, so this helps justify MDP's approach.- The focus on few-shot learning reflects the growing popularity of prompt-based learning paradigms like in GPT-3. Backdoor attacks and defenses in this paradigm are less explored than fine-tuning, so this paper provides useful foundations.- The paper studies the problem under realistic constraints like limited data, unknown attack details, etc faced by users. This differs from some prior work that assumes more knowledge.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions over related work by proposing a novel backdoor defense tailored to prompt-based few-shot learning and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness. The paper addresses an important open problem as prompt-based learning becomes more popular.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:1. Supporting more tasks beyond sentence classification. The authors only evaluated their defense method on sentence classification tasks. They suggest it would be interesting to explore its effectiveness on other NLP applications like dialogue, text summarization, and machine translation. 2. Exploring more pre-trained language models (PLMs). The authors only used RoBERTa-large as the victim PLM in their experiments. They suggest evaluating the defense on other popular PLMs like GPT-3, T5, etc.3. Handling fewer-shot scenarios. The authors acknowledge their defense still performs sub-optimally when the user has access to even fewer labeled samples (e.g. 1-shot or 0-shot). Improving the defense's effectiveness under extreme data scarcity is noted as an important research direction.4. Considering alternative threat models. The authors assumed a specific attack model where the PLM is backdoored and prompt-tuned on clean data. They suggest extending the defense to other threat models where the backdoor is injected at different stages.5. Developing a generic defense framework. To handle the diverse choices of PLMs and datasets, the authors propose synthesizing multiple configurations into a generic framework for detecting backdoors.In summary, the main future directions aim to expand the applicability and robustness of the defense across more tasks, models, and data-scarce regimes, as well as considering alternative ways the backdoor could be injected. Developing a unified framework is suggested to handle the diversity of real-world deployment scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes MDP, a novel defense method for protecting pre-trained language models (PLMs) used as few-shot learners against textual backdoor attacks. The key idea is to leverage the observation that poisoned samples tend to be more sensitive to random word masking compared to clean samples. Specifically, MDP measures the representation variation of a given sample when its words are randomly masked, using the limited few-shot data as distributional anchors. It then detects samples with high masking sensitivity as poisoned ones. To further improve masking invariance of clean samples, MDP also optimizes the prompt to minimize prediction changes under masking. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets and attacks shows MDP effectively defends PLMs as few-shot learners, outperforming adapted baselines. The paper provides both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging masking sensitivity to detect poisoned samples. Overall, it represents an important step towards securing PLMs under the prompt-based, few-shot learning paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel defense method called MDP for defending pre-trained language models (PLMs) against backdoor attacks in few-shot learning scenarios. In few-shot learning, models are adapted to new tasks using only a small number of training examples per class. The paper shows that PLMs adapted via prompt tuning are vulnerable to backdoor attacks in this setting. The proposed defense MDP exploits the observation that poisoned samples tend to be more sensitive to random word masking compared to clean samples. It uses the limited few-shot data as distributional anchors to measure the representational change of a given sample under varying masking. MDP detects poisoned samples as ones with significant representational variation. It further optimizes prompts to improve masking invariance of clean samples. Experiments using representative attacks on benchmark datasets demonstrate MDP's superior detection accuracy over baseline methods. The paper provides both empirical validation and theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of MDP in creating a dilemma between attack success and evasion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes MDP, a novel defense method for protecting prompt-based few-shot learners against textual backdoor attacks. MDP exploits the observation that compared to clean samples, poisoned samples often show higher sensitivity to random word masking. It measures such sensitivity by leveraging the limited few-shot data as "distributional anchors" - using the prediction distributions of few-shot samples as reference, MDP computes the representational change of a given sample under varying masking. Samples with significant variations are detected as poisoned. To further enhance the detection, MDP optimizes the prompt to improve the masking-invariance of clean samples. By minimizing the prediction difference of few-shot samples under masking, the prompt tuning process makes clean samples more robust to masking. This amplifies the gap of masking sensitivity between clean and poisoned samples.At inference time, MDP masks the given sample multiple times, compares its representations to the few-shot anchors, and identifies samples with substantial variations as poisoned. Experiments show MDP effectively defends prompt-based learners against various backdoor attacks under the few-shot setting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The main problem this paper is addressing is defending pre-trained language models (PLMs) against backdoor attacks under the few-shot learning scenario. Specifically:- PLMs adapted as few-shot learners via prompting are shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers can induce misclassification. - Existing defenses designed for fine-tuned models perform poorly under the few-shot scenario due to limited training data and computational resources.- The paper proposes a new defense method called MDP tailored to the few-shot learning setting that detects poisoned samples by measuring their sensitivity to random masking compared to clean samples. So in summary, the key question is how to effectively defend PLMs adapted as few-shot learners against backdoor attacks given the unique challenges of limited data and compute constraints. The paper proposes MDP as a novel defense designed specifically for this few-shot scenario.
