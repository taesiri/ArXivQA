# [Augmenty: A Python Library for Structured Text Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05520)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text augmentation is a useful tool for training and evaluating NLP models, but existing libraries have limitations in functionality and flexibility. 
- Many are confined to basic text classification tasks and do not handle structured prediction tasks like NER well.
- Existing tools neglect tasks that require alignment of annotations with text augmentations.

Proposed Solution:
- Augmenty is a new Python library for structured text augmentation built on top of spaCy.
- It allows augmentation of both text and annotations in spaCy Doc objects.
- Provides token, span, and sentence level augmenters ranging from basics like word replacement to advanced like keyboard errors.
- Integrates with NLTK, WordNet, and word vectors for more augmentations.
- Allows flexible construction of augmentation pipelines specific to a task.
- Designed to be compatible with spaCy for easy integration.

Main Contributions:
- Enables structured text augmentation for a wide range of NLP tasks beyond just classification.
- Handles alignment of annotations with text augmentations automatically.  
- Provides a flexible interface to build custom augmentation pipelines tailored to a task.
- Integrates well with spaCy for easy application to existing workflows and model training.
- Opens up more applications of augmentation for training robust models and evaluation.

In summary, Augmenty fills an important gap by enabling structured text augmentation for diverse NLP tasks with both text and annotations. Its flexibility and spaCy integration facilitate easy adoption for training better models and more insightful evaluations.
