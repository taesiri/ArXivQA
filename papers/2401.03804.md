# [TeleChat Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03804)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors release TeleChat, a suite of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with parameter sizes of 3 billion, 7 billion, and 12 billion. The foundation model of TeleChat is pretrained on a large corpus containing trillions of tokens in diverse English and Chinese texts. The finetuned model variants are then released to the public community.

2. The paper presents a comprehensive data cleaning workflow including rule-based filtering, multi-level deduplication, high-quality data selection, and data security processing. This ensures the quality of the pretraining data used for TeleChat. The authors also release 1TB of their preprocessed pretraining textual data.

3. The authors provide details on their supervised fine-tuning methodology, which includes techniques like dataset blending, noisy embedding fine-tuning, and multi-stage long context training. Disclosing such implementation details related to alignment of LLMs is rare and promotes reproducibility.

4. The paper demonstrates the performance of TeleChat on various tasks and benchmarks. The results indicate that TeleChat achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing models of similar size.

5. The authors describe their approach to mitigate hallucination issues in LLMs by integrating knowledge graphs during inference. This technique enhances the model's capabilities for factual question answering.

In summary, the main highlights are the release of the TeleChat models, the disclosure of their training methodology, benchmark evaluations, and techniques to improve fidelity - all of which collectively advance research and development of responsible and transparent LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions employing heuristic rules for efficient and effective text cleaning. Can you provide more details on the specific heuristic rules used and why they were chosen? How were the rules developed and validated?

2. In the deduplication process, you utilized different locally sensitive hash functions for document-level and paragraph-level deduplication. What were the specific algorithms used and why is it beneficial to use different algorithms at each level?

3. For high-quality data selection, you trained a 5-gram Kneser-Ney model on existing quality corpora. What corpora were used and what criteria were used to determine quality? How much data was in these corpora?

4. You split the data into head/middle/tail based on perplexity score for sampling. What were the exact thresholds used for determining head/middle/tail splits? How did you arrive at these specific values?

5. The security filtering uses a multi-model classification approach focused on detecting inappropriate, violent and sensitive content. Can you elaborate on the specific models used, the training methodology, and evaluation metrics/results?  

6. Bfloat16 mixed precision is used during pretraining for stability. What criteria were used to determine which operations use float32 vs bfloat16 precision? Were any other mixed precision configurations evaluated?

7. The batch generation process uses shuffling and concatenation to create coherent contexts from the same source. What were the exact batch construction rules used here (max chunks per source, etc)?

8. You utilize dynamic NTK-aware interpolation for extending context lengths. Can you explain the interpolation update equations and scheduling used here? How was the scaling factor determined?

9. What modifications were made to attention scaling methods like logN-scaling to handle the gradual context increase in multi-stage long context training?

10. Loss masking is used in SFT to calculate loss only for model outputs. What is the detailed implementation? Were other selective loss calculation methods explored?
