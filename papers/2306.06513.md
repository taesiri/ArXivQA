# [Learning Image-Adaptive Codebooks for Class-Agnostic Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06513)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn image-adaptive codebooks for class-agnostic image restoration. 

The key hypotheses are:

- Using a set of basis codebooks corresponding to different image categories can lead to a more flexible and expressive representation compared to a single universal codebook. 

- An image-adaptive codebook constructed as a weighted combination of basis codebooks can better capture the diverse visual patterns in natural images.

- The image-adaptive codebooks can serve as a strong generative prior for high-quality image restoration on various tasks like super-resolution and inpainting.

In summary, the paper proposes image-adaptive codebook learning as a way to achieve high-quality class-agnostic image restoration, which contrasts with prior work that relies on class-specific codebooks. The central hypothesis is that image-adaptive codebooks provide a more flexible discrete generative prior for modeling complex natural images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AdaCode, an image-adaptive codebook learning method for class-agnostic image restoration. The key ideas are:

- Instead of learning a single codebook for each image category, AdaCode learns a set of basis codebooks, where each codebook captures patterns from a different image category or semantic class. 

- For a given input image, AdaCode generates a weight map to compute a weighted combination of codes from the basis codebooks to form an adaptive codebook specific to that image.

- This allows AdaCode to be more flexible and expressive in representing diverse visual patterns compared to methods that rely on a single universal codebook.

- AdaCode achieves state-of-the-art performance on image reconstruction, super-resolution, and inpainting tasks while using a comparable codebook size.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the idea of an image-adaptive codebook by learning basis codebooks and weight maps for combining them, which provides a more powerful class-agnostic generative prior for image restoration.
