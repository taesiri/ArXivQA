# [AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Humans can intuitively command robots through natural language, but limitations in reasoning capabilities of current AI models constrain direct translation of language instructions into executable robot plans. 
- Current approaches face challenges in dynamically capturing the initial state or environment needed for planning.

Proposed Solution - AutoGPT+P:
- Combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system based on a large language model (LLM). 
- Affordances encompass the action possibilities between an agent and environment/objects. Deriving planning domain from affordances enables symbolic planning with arbitrary objects.
- System has two main stages:
   1) Perceiving environment as objects and extracting scene affordances using object detection and automatically querying ChatGPT to map object classes to affordances
   2) Task planning by selecting planning 'tools' using LLM - tools include Plan, Partial Plan, Explore, Suggest Alternative
- Allows handling incomplete information by exploring scene, suggesting alternatives or providing partial plans.

Main Contributions:
- Novel affordance-based scene representation combining object detection and automatic object-affordance mapping with ChatGPT (89% F1 score)
- Task planning approach utilizing affordance representation and LLM-based tool selection to handle missing objects, suggest alternatives, explore etc.
- Evaluation in simulation on 150 scenarios covering tasks like pick & place, pouring, chopping, sorting etc. and 79% success rate
- Validation on humanoid robots ARMAR-6 and ARMAR-DE demonstrating feasibility of approach for subset of tasks

In summary, the paper presents an affordance-based framework to enable intuitive human commands of robots using natural language. By leveraging object affordances and an LLM-based planning approach, the system can dynamically reason on the environment to generate plans even with incomplete information. Evaluations demonstrate viability and flexibility of the approach.
