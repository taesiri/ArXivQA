# [TSGAN: An Optical-to-SAR Dual Conditional GAN for Optical based SAR   Temporal Shifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Translating optical imagery to SAR imagery (Opt2SAR) is an ill-posed problem with multiple possible SAR representations for a given optical input, due to differences in SAR viewing geometry. This makes it challenging for models to learn the mapping.
- Existing Opt2SAR translation methods struggle with "fiction" artifacts where the generated SAR image contains false details not present in the real SAR data. This is especially problematic in unchanged regions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel "SAR Temporal Shifting" approach. Instead of direct Opt2SAR translation, the model takes an older SAR image and modifies it based on changes observed in optical imagery over time to generate a newer SAR image.
- A dual conditional GAN (TSGAN) model is designed using a siamese encoder architecture to implement temporal shifting. It takes optical data from time T2, SAR data from time T1, and the optical change map as inputs.

Main Contributions:

1. Introduction of TSGAN - an attention-based siamese encoder GAN architecture tailored for SAR temporal shifting using optical change context.

2. A framework to automatically create paired multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical datasets on Google Earth Engine.

3. A change-weighted loss function to prevent the model from simply copying the input SAR image unchanged, by assigning higher loss to errors in changed regions.

4. Change-weighted evaluation metrics (WSSIM, WPSNR) to separately assess performance on changed vs unchanged areas.

Results:
- TSGAN avoids fiction artifacts and preserves details better than baseline Opt2SAR methods like Pix2Pix. Metrics show it performs significantly better, especially in unchanged regions.

- Attention mechanisms in TSGAN further improve generation of built structures in changed areas. The change-weighted loss prevents simple copying of input SAR.

- Performance is better for removing buildings (backward shift) than generating new ones (forward shift). But still shows promise for converting optical data to SAR.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective approach for leveraging optical data to generate SAR imagery while avoiding common artifact problems. The datasets and code are publicly available to facilitate further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel dual conditional GAN architecture named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN) for optical-to-SAR translation that modifies a SAR image from one timestamp based on changes observed in optical data over time in order to generate a new SAR image for a desired timestamp.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of a novel attention-based siamese encoder UNET Architecture GAN (TSGAN) for optical-to-SAR temporal shifting. This architecture takes optical data from a specified timestamp and SAR data from a prior timestamp as input to establish the geometry of the resultant SAR data. It then trains the model to adapt the input SAR data based on changes in the optical data over time.

2. Design of an automatic framework using Google Earth Engine to download paired Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical datasets. This facilitates easy creation of datasets for different geographical regions to train and test optical-to-SAR translation models.

3. Use of a change-weighted L1 loss function to prevent the model from simply copying the input SAR data to the output. This assigns higher weights to changed regions to address class imbalance between changed and unchanged areas.

4. Implementation of change-weighted evaluation metrics like weighted SSIM and PSNR to separately assess model performance on changed vs unchanged regions.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of the temporal shifting concept and TSGAN architecture for optical-to-SAR translation, which helps mitigate common problems like fiction/hallucination compared to regular translation models. The automatic dataset creation framework and specialized evaluation metrics also facilitate further research in this area.
