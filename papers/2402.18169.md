# [MIKO: Multimodal Intention Knowledge Distillation from Large Language   Models for Social-Media Commonsense Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding users' intentions behind social media posts is important for many downstream applications, but remains challenging due to the implicit and multimodal nature of the data. 
- Existing methods struggle with noisy elements in posts like hashtags and abbreviations. Large language models (LLMs) also face difficulties in accurately interpreting and generating reliable intentions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes MIKO, a novel framework to distill intention knowledge from multimodal social media posts using LLMs and MLLMs.
- It first uses an MLLM to generate descriptions for images in the posts. 
- An LLM then extracts key information from both text and image descriptions to handle noise.  
- Finally, the LLM generates potential intentions based on the processed information, guided by prompts aligned with commonsense knowledge relations.

Main Contributions:
- Presents the first automated framework to uncover intentions in open-domain, multimodal social media posts using LLMs.
- Compiles public datasets, applies MIKO on 137K posts to construct an intention knowledge base.
- Conducts two-stage annotation and benchmarking to demonstrate quality of generated intentions.
- Shows performance boost on sarcasm detection by incorporating distilled intentions, validating their benefit for downstream tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative methodology leveraging LLMs in a hierarchical manner to acquire social intentions from complex multimodal data. Extensive experiments highlight the potential of this distilled knowledge to enhance understanding of social media.
