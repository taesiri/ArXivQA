# [Multi-Sender Persuasion -- A Computational Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04971)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies multi-sender Bayesian persuasion, where multiple informed senders with possible conflicting interests try to influence the decision of a single receiver through signaling. This is an important model for many real-world applications.

- Unlike standard Bayesian persuasion with one sender, finding the equilibrium signaling strategies for multiple senders is very challenging, both theoretically and computationally.

Main Contributions:

Theoretical Hardness Results:
- The paper first shows that computing the best response signaling strategy for one sender, fixing others' strategies, is NP-hard. 

- It also shows that finding an equilibrium signaling strategy profile for senders is PPAD-hard in general.

- These hardness results motivate developing methods for finding local equilibria.

Method for Finding Local Equilibria:  
- The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture that can represent the discontinuous sender utilities.

- Combined with extra-gradient algorithm, the method can find local equilibria that Pareto dominate known benchmarks.

- Specifically, the discovered local equilibria improve over full-revelation equilibria and equilibria found by prior network architectures.

- The proposed network's superior expressiveness for approximating non-linear, discontinuous functions is demonstrated.

In summary, the paper provides strong theoretical foundations on the intrinsic complexity of multi-sender Bayesian persuasion. It also offers an effective deep learning solution for finding high-quality local equilibria in this challenging game. The techniques can inspire related problems involving discontinuous utilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper studies computationally efficient methods for finding local Nash equilibria in multi-sender Bayesian persuasion games, proving that finding global equilibria is intractable in general and proposing a novel neural network architecture paired with extra-gradient optimization to discover high-quality local equilibria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Theoretically, it proves that finding an equilibrium in the multi-sender persuasion game is PPAD-Hard, even for small instances. In particular, computing the best response signaling policy for a sender, which is essential for finding equilibria, is shown to be NP-Hard. These hardness results motivate developing methods for finding local rather global equilibria.

2) For finding local equilibria efficiently, the paper proposes a novel differentiable neural network architecture that can approximate the discontinuous and non-linear utility functions in this game. This allows gradient-based methods like extra-gradient to be applied for locating local equilibria. 

3) Empirically, the paper shows that by combining the proposed neural network architecture with extra-gradient, better local equilibria can be found compared to using other continuous neural networks or a recently proposed discontinuous network. The discovered local equilibria are shown to Pareto dominate the theoretical full revelation equilibrium and significantly improve upon random initialization.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions towards understanding and solving the challenging computational problem of finding equilibria in multi-sender persuasion games. The proposed neural network method may also hold independent interest for other multiplayer games with discontinuous utilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multi-sender persuasion - The paper focuses on a model with multiple informed senders trying to influence a single receiver towards certain actions. This extends the standard Bayesian persuasion model with a single sender.

- Nash equilibrium - The solution concept studied for the game between multiple senders is the Nash equilibrium of their signaling policies. Finding and characterizing equilibria is a core focus.

- Computational hardness - Several hardness results are proven, showing that computing an equilibrium or even best responding is intractable in general. These motivate approximate and local concepts. 

- Local Nash equilibria - Given the hardness results, the paper studies discovery of local equilibria where no profitable deviation exists in a small neighborhood.

- Differentiable economics - The paper uses deep learning based techniques popularized in this emerging area to find local equilibria. The utility functions are modeled by novel neural networks.

- Discontinuous utilities - A core contribution is a network architecture that can represent the non-linear, discontinuous utilities that arise in this game.

Some other potentially relevant terms are information design, principal-agent models, Bayesian games, signaling games, and learning in games. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called DNL that combines a lower linear network and a higher non-linear network connected through a hypernetwork. What is the intuition behind having this combination of linear and non-linear components? How does it help capture the discontinuous utilities in multi-sender persuasion games?

2. The paper shows that computing best response signaling schemes is NP-Hard even with just 2 senders. What aspect of the multi-sender setting makes best response intractable compared to single sender persuasion where best signaling schemes can be computed in polynomial time?  

3. The local Nash equilibrium concept relaxes the constraints on profitable deviations being available in the entire strategy space. What are some ways this solution concept could fail to produce outcomes that are stable in practice? Are there natural assumptions one could make on agent behaviors where local equilibria would suffice?

4. The paper combines deep learning with equilibrium finding algorithms like extra-gradient method. What are some challenges in getting these two different paradigms to work well together? How does the paper address pitfalls like instability, convergence issues etc.?

5. How does the neural architecture used here for multi-sender persuasion games differ from existing ones used in the literature on learning in games? What modifications were essential to handle discontinuities and non-linearities?  

6. Could the proposed network architecture be applied to other games with discontinuous utilities beyond persuasion? What are some examples of such games and how might the techniques transfer?

7. The paper demonstrates superior performance against various baselines. What are some alternative state-of-the-art methods you might consider for an even more rigorous evaluation? How could the experimental setup be strengthened?

8. What theoretical guarantees does the paper provide on the quality of equilibria discovered by the proposed deep learning approach? Can you derive any new bounds leveraging existing analyses?

9. The paper focuses on finding local Nash equilibria. What are some appropriate refinements like subgame perfection that one could investigate in this domain? How might the techniques need to be adapted? 

10. The multi-sender persuasion model has connections to areas like multi-agent RL and generative modeling. What are some interesting future directions along these lines that build upon this work?
