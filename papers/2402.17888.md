# [ConjNorm: Tractable Density Estimation for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which aims to identify test samples that come from a different distribution than the training data. This is an important capability for machine learning models deployed in the real world. The key challenge lies in designing an effective scoring function to discern OOD data, ideally grounded in density estimation. However, accurately estimating densities is non-trivial due to intractable partition functions needed for normalization. Recent methods make restrictive assumptions about the data distribution or use distance metrics that may not align well with density. There is a lack of theoretical guidance on designing scoring functions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for OOD scoring function design based on Bregman divergence. This connects the exponential family of distributions with corresponding Bregman divergences through a conjugate relationship. Leveraging this framework, the paper puts forth a ConjNorm method that converts the search for an optimal scoring function to finding the best norm coefficient $p$ against the dataset. To address the partition function challenge, the paper explores baseline estimation methods and contributes a new importance sampling technique that is unbiased and analytically tractable.  

Main Contributions:
- A Bregman divergence-based theoretical framework to unify and guide scoring function design for OOD detection across an expansive family of distributions
- Introduction of the ConjNorm method that simplifies scoring function search through norm coefficient selection
- An importance sampling approach to obtain an unbiased, tractable estimator of intractable partition functions 
- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art OOD detection performance on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, using various network architectures and training protocols

In summary, the paper makes significant theoretical and technical contributions towards principled and practical density-based OOD detection. The proposed ConjNorm method sets new benchmarks across detection setups and offers strong generalizability.
