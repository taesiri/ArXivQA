# [ConvNet vs Transformer, Supervised vs CLIP: Beyond ImageNet Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09215)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides an in-depth comparative analysis of leading vision models - ConvNeXt (ConvNet) and ViT (Transformer) - trained with both supervised and CLIP objectives. The models selected have similar ImageNet accuracies and compute requirements, allowing for a fair evaluation. Going beyond the standard ImageNet metric, the authors investigate a diverse set of model behaviors including types of errors, robustness, transferability, calibration, invariance, and shape/texture bias. Key findings show substantial variation in model strengths based on architecture and training paradigm, despite their identical ImageNet accuracy. For instance, CLIP models are more robust to challenging ImageNet factors but less calibrated than supervised models. Supervised ConvNeXt excels at robustness, invariance and transferability, rivaling CLIP models in some cases. All models struggle with texture variations. The analysis emphasizes the need to look beyond common benchmarks like ImageNet when selecting models, as they fail to capture critical nuances. It also highlights the value of developing new robustness datasets unrelated to ImageNet's distribution. Overall, the paper provides important insights into model similarities and differences that can guide architecture selection based on intended use cases.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides an in-depth analysis and comparison of ConvNets (ConvNeXt) and Vision Transformers (ViT), trained with both supervised and CLIP (vision-language) objectives. The models analyzed have similar ImageNet accuracies, allowing for a fair evaluation beyond this single metric. Key findings indicate that CLIP models make fewer relative mistakes on ImageNet-X but supervised models are better calibrated and more robust to distribution shifts. All models struggle with texture variations. CLIP models excel in transferability while supervised ConvNeXt is superior in transformation invariance and on synthetic data. The analysis reveals substantial diversity in model behaviors not captured by ImageNet accuracy alone, emphasizing the need for nuanced, benchmark-driven model selection based on target use cases. The results highlight issues with the overreliance on ImageNet and derived datasets, suggesting new benchmarks are needed to evaluate real-world model performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides an in-depth analysis of ConvNet and Vision Transformer models trained with supervised and CLIP objectives, finding that they exhibit distinct strengths not captured by standard ImageNet accuracy comparisons.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is:

How do leading computer vision models with similar ImageNet accuracies differ in their behaviors and capabilities beyond this standard evaluation metric?

The key points are:

- The paper compares ConvNets (ConvNeXt) and Vision Transformers (ViT), with both supervised and CLIP training paradigms. 

- The models chosen have comparable ImageNet accuracies within each training paradigm, to ensure a fair evaluation.

- The analysis focuses on model behaviors and properties beyond just ImageNet accuracy, such as types of errors, robustness, calibration, invariance, etc. 

- The goal is to uncover nuances and variations in model capabilities not captured by the ImageNet metric alone. 

- The hypothesis is that models with similar ImageNet accuracy can still substantially differ in other important aspects, highlighting the need for more comprehensive analysis when selecting models.

So in summary, the central research question is how models with matched ImageNet performance differ in their behaviors, to demonstrate the limitations of judging models solely by this standard metric. The paper aims to uncover the diversity in model strengths through an in-depth comparative analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive analysis and comparison of ConvNet (ConvNeXt) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models trained with supervised learning and CLIP across various characteristics beyond just ImageNet accuracy. 

Some key findings from the analysis:

- CLIP models make fewer mistakes relative to their ImageNet accuracy compared to supervised models, but supervised models are better calibrated and more robust on ImageNet benchmarks.

- ConvNeXt excels on synthetic data compared to ViT for both supervised and CLIP models.

- Supervised ConvNeXt demonstrates great transferability, close to CLIP models, suggesting architecture is still an important factor. 

- All models struggle with texture biases and make similar types of mistakes overall.

- Each model exhibits unique strengths not captured by ImageNet accuracy alone, highlighting the need for more nuanced analysis and metrics when selecting models.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive comparative study across various models and training paradigms to reveal insights beyond the standard ImageNet metric.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of ConvNet and Vision Transformer models trained with supervised and CLIP objectives. The key ways it compares to other research in this field are:

- It studies a wide range of model behaviors beyond just ImageNet accuracy, including types of errors, calibration, invariances, etc. Most prior works focused only on one or two properties in isolation. 

- It compares modern architectures - ConvNeXt and ViT. Many previous analyses used older ConvNets like ResNet which gave Transformers an unfair advantage. 

- It includes both supervised and CLIP training paradigms. Prior work largely focused just on self-supervised vs supervised or different architectures. Comparing CLIP and supervised training is novel.

- The models compared have similar ImageNet accuracy. This controls for performance, allowing a fairer assessment of other characteristics.

- It highlights issues with relying solely on ImageNet-derived benchmarks and suggests developing new datasets.

- It provides extensive empirical results over a diverse set of properties and datasets. Most related works were narrower in scope.

Overall, this paper stands out for its comprehensive, controlled comparison of multiple contemporary models and training methods using a multifaceted evaluation. It provides one of the most extensive empirical investigations in analyzing model behaviors beyond ImageNet accuracy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my understanding of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:

- Developing new robustness benchmarks that are not derived from or related to ImageNet. The paper finds that existing robustness benchmarks share the same set of classes as ImageNet, which gives supervised models an advantage since they were finetuned on ImageNet. New benchmarks with different data distributions are needed.

- Creating entirely new evaluation benchmarks with more diverse, real-world representative data. Many current benchmarks are biased towards ImageNet, which does not fully capture models' ability to handle real-world vision challenges. 

- Further analysis of model behaviors with different model sizes. The paper finds CLIP models exhibit lower shape bias compared to supervised models, and notes that prior work has shown larger ViT models can achieve higher shape bias. This suggests model size could play an important role.

- Additional research on synthetic datasets for training and evaluating models. The paper finds ConvNeXt performs better than ViT on the synthetic PUG-ImageNet dataset. More work on leveraging synthetic data is suggested.

- Studying the impact of different training data scale and quality for CLIP models. The paper hypothesizes differences in training data could explain differences between CLIP and supervised models.

In summary, the main suggestions are to create new benchmarks not tied to ImageNet, use more diverse real-world data, further explore synthetic data, and study the impact of model size and training data differences. The key goal is evaluating models more comprehensively beyond ImageNet accuracy.
