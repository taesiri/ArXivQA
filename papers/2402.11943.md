# [LEMMA: Towards LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with   External Knowledge Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11943)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant threats to individuals and societies due to its increased credibility and impact compared to textual misinformation. 
- Detecting multimodal misinformation is challenging as it requires robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper first investigates the potential of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection given their capabilities in processing visual and textual information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills.  
- It is found that while LVLMs demonstrate promising capabilities, their reasoning presents limited power with a lack of evidence. 
- To address this, the paper proposes LEMMA - an LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection approach with External Knowledge Augmentation.

Key Ideas of LEMMA:
- Leverages LVLM's intuition and reasoning capabilities.
- Augments LVLM reasoning with external knowledge to enhance accuracy.  
- Maintains LVLM's advantages while overcoming limitations of excessive caution due to potential evidence inaccuracies.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of LVLM performance on multimodal misinformation detection.
- Proposal of LEMMA that effectively utilizes LVLM strengths and addresses limitations via external knowledge.
- Design of external knowledge extraction module tailored to enhance LVLM reasoning for this task.

Key Results:
- LEMMA improves accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on the Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.

In summary, the paper explores the potential of LVLMs for multimodal misinformation detection and proposes an effective approach LEMMA that integrates LVLM capabilities with external knowledge augmentation. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements over strong baselines.
