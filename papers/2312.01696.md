# [BEVNeXt: Reviving Dense BEV Frameworks for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01696)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes BEVNeXt, an enhanced dense bird's-eye-view (BEV) framework for multi-view 3D object detection. The authors identify three weaknesses of existing dense BEV methods - insufficient 2D modeling, inadequate temporal modeling, and feature distortion during uplifting. To address these, they introduce three main components: (1) A conditional random field (CRF)-based depth estimation module that imposes object-level consistency without extra supervision, enhancing depth accuracy. (2) A Res2Fusion module inspired by Res2Net that expands the receptive field for temporal aggregation over multiple frames in the dynamic 3D space. (3) A two-stage object decoder that first generates object heatmaps then refines the regions-of-interest using CRF-modulated depth embedding and perspective information from 2D feature maps, compensating for distortion. Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance - 56.0% NDS on val split and 64.2% NDS on test split. The improved localization capability is also evidenced by the lowest translation error compared to prior arts. Overall, through the proposed enhancements, BEVNeXt revives dense BEV methods to surpass recent sparse transformer decoders in comprehensive detection ability while retaining advantages like complete scene modeling.
