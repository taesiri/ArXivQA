# [CorpusBrain++: A Continual Generative Pre-Training Framework for   Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILTs) rely on retrieving relevant documents from corpora like Wikipedia to generate answers. 
- Existing methods like CorpusBrain achieve state-of-the-art performance but are designed for static corpora, while real-world corpora evolve dynamically over time as new documents are continuously added.
- Naively adapting CorpusBrain to dynamic corpora leads to catastrophic forgetting of old documents and inadequate learning of new documents. Addressing this is crucial for KILTs in real-world scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce the continual document learning (CDL) task for KILTs and construct a benchmark dataset KILT++ for evaluation.
- They propose CorpusBrain++, a continual generative pre-training framework, to adapt CorpusBrain to dynamic corpora. CorpusBrain++ has two key features:
   - A backbone-adapter architecture where a fixed backbone retains retrieval capacity and dynamic adapters capture task-specific characteristics.
   - An experience replay strategy that rehearses old documents similar to new ones during pre-training to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the CDL task for KILTs and provides the KILT++ benchmark for evaluation.
- Comprehensively analyzes limitations of CorpusBrain on the CDL task.
- Develops CorpusBrain++ to enable CorpusBrain to handle dynamic corpora via the backbone-adapter architecture and experience replay.
- Experiments show CorpusBrain++ significantly outperforms baselines in retrieval performance while preventing catastrophic forgetting and allowing positive transfer.

In summary, the paper identifies the important open problem of adapting KILT models to evolving corpora, proposes the CorpusBrain++ solution, and demonstrates its effectiveness - highlighting key future research directions for dynamic knowledge retrieval.
