# [Point Transformer with Federated Learning for Predicting Breast Cancer   HER2 Status from Hematoxylin and Eosin-Stained Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06454)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a point transformer model called PointTransformerDDA+ to predict breast cancer HER2 status directly from hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained whole slide images (WSIs) using federated learning across multiple sites. The model treats each WSI patch as a point with 3D coordinate information. It employs a point transformer architecture to capture both local context and long-range dependencies between patches. A novel farthest cosine sampling method is proposed to select the most distinctive features for aggregation. To address label imbalance across sites, a dynamic distribution adjustment strategy is used with an auxiliary classifier to establish a well-initialized model and mitigate variation. Experiments on 2687 WSIs across 4 sites and 229 unseen WSIs show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the model's ability to leverage multi-site data while preserving privacy. Key innovations include the point transformer design for WSIs, the sampling method for feature selection, and the distribution adjustment approach for federated learning. By predicting HER2 status directly from standard HE images, the model has the potential to reduce costs and expedite treatment decisions without additional assays.
