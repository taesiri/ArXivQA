# [Eye Motion Matters for 3D Face Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advances in single-image 3D face reconstruction have shown remarkable progress in capturing facial identity and expressions. However, most techniques neglect the nuanced dynamics of the eye region, often generating reconstructions with inconsistently open eyes regardless of the input image. This is a critical limitation in accurately reflecting subtle expressions and dynamic changes in the eyes. 

Proposed Solution:
To address this eye state inconsistency, the authors propose a pioneering solution consisting of:

1) Eye Landmark Adjustment Module (ELAM): Serves to mitigate landmark inaccuracies due to the relatively small eye area. It integrates an eye state detector and flexible landmark adjustment rule to adapt to varying eye states.

2) Local Dynamic Loss (LDL): Captures weighted relative distances between eyelid/lip landmark pairs. This enhances the model's ability to adapt to dynamics of small facial regions like the eyes and mouth.

Main Contributions:

- Introduce ELAM to guarantee correct eye landmark information, enabling accurate recreation of various eye states

- Propose LDL to precisely reconstruct small dynamic facial areas, significantly improving 3D face reconstruction

- Evaluate performance using accuracy and F1-score for eye region, in addition to conventional metric of 3D shape errors  

- Achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the ability to address the eye motion issue

The proposed pioneering solution effectively tackles the problem of eye state inconsistency in 3D face reconstruction. The introduced ELAM and LDL allow capturing subtle expression changes and dynamics of the eyes and mouth. Extensive experiments validate the significant contributions towards this particular challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an Eye Landmark Adjustment Module and Local Dynamic Loss to improve 3D face reconstruction of images with varying eye states.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an Eye Landmark Adjustment Module (ELAM) to guarantee correct eye landmark information and capture subtle changes in the eyes. 

2. It introduces a Local Dynamic Loss (LDL) to accurately reconstruct small facial areas like the eyes and mouth, bringing improvement to 3D face reconstruction.

3. It evaluates the approach comprehensively, conducting extensive experiments on two datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in addressing the challenge of reconstructing varied eye states.

4. The code is open-sourced to facilitate future research.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards capturing the dynamic features of the eye region in 3D face reconstruction, which has been overlooked in previous work. The proposed ELAM and LDL specially target the eye motion issue to generate more accurate and lifelike 3D facial models.
