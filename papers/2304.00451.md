# [Re-IQA: Unsupervised Learning for Image Quality Assessment in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00451)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is: How can we train deep neural networks to learn robust low-level quality-aware image representations and high-level content-aware image representations in an unsupervised manner for perceptual image quality assessment, especially for images "in the wild" with complex authentic distortions? The key hypotheses of the paper are:1. Image quality can vary spatially within an image itself based on content. So quality-aware features (PQAF) may vary between neighboring patches but more significantly between distant patches.2. PQAF of two randomly sampled images are different, assuming different semantic content. 3. Different distorted versions of the same image have different PQAF.To address these hypotheses, the authors propose an unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA with two components:1. A content-aware encoder trained using contrastive learning on unlabeled images to extract high-level semantic features.2. A quality-aware encoder trained using proposed image augmentation, cropping, and swapping techniques on both pristine and authentically distorted images to extract complementary low-level perceptual quality features. The key novelty is the ability to learn quality-aware representations separate from high-level content representations in a completely unsupervised manner for perceptual image quality assessment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a Mixture of Experts approach to train two separate encoders to learn high-level content and low-level image quality features in an unsupervised setting. The novelty is in learning complementary low-level representations of image quality along with high-level content features.2. It demonstrates the superiority of high-level content representations learned through unsupervised pre-training compared to supervised pre-trained features on ImageNet. The content features are learned using MoCo-v2.3. It proposes a novel image augmentation and intra-pair image swapping scheme to enable learning of low-level image quality representations. The augmentation helps prevent learning discrete distortion classes.4. The learned low and high-level image representations are combined and mapped to quality scores using a simple linear regressor, eliminating expensive fine-tuning.5. Extensive experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale image quality assessment datasets with real and synthetic distortions. This demonstrates the efficacy of the unsupervised learned representations.In summary, the key novelty is in the unsupervised learning of complementary low-level quality and high-level content representations, which when combined provide state-of-the-art image quality assessment performance without requiring fine-tuning on each dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA to generate complementary content and quality-aware image representations for the challenging task of no-reference image quality assessment. The key ideas are training two encoders using contrastive learning, one for high-level content features and another for low-level perceptual quality features, and then combining them with a simple regressor to predict quality scores. The main novelty is the ability to learn low-level quality representations that complement high-level content features in an unsupervised manner.The overall summary would be:The paper introduces Re-IQA, an unsupervised learning framework to generate complementary content and quality-aware image representations for no-reference image quality assessment by training two encoders with contrastive learning, which are then combined with a regressor to predict quality scores.
