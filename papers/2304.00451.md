# [Re-IQA: Unsupervised Learning for Image Quality Assessment in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00451)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is: How can we train deep neural networks to learn robust low-level quality-aware image representations and high-level content-aware image representations in an unsupervised manner for perceptual image quality assessment, especially for images "in the wild" with complex authentic distortions? The key hypotheses of the paper are:1. Image quality can vary spatially within an image itself based on content. So quality-aware features (PQAF) may vary between neighboring patches but more significantly between distant patches.2. PQAF of two randomly sampled images are different, assuming different semantic content. 3. Different distorted versions of the same image have different PQAF.To address these hypotheses, the authors propose an unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA with two components:1. A content-aware encoder trained using contrastive learning on unlabeled images to extract high-level semantic features.2. A quality-aware encoder trained using proposed image augmentation, cropping, and swapping techniques on both pristine and authentically distorted images to extract complementary low-level perceptual quality features. The key novelty is the ability to learn quality-aware representations separate from high-level content representations in a completely unsupervised manner for perceptual image quality assessment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a Mixture of Experts approach to train two separate encoders to learn high-level content and low-level image quality features in an unsupervised setting. The novelty is in learning complementary low-level representations of image quality along with high-level content features.2. It demonstrates the superiority of high-level content representations learned through unsupervised pre-training compared to supervised pre-trained features on ImageNet. The content features are learned using MoCo-v2.3. It proposes a novel image augmentation and intra-pair image swapping scheme to enable learning of low-level image quality representations. The augmentation helps prevent learning discrete distortion classes.4. The learned low and high-level image representations are combined and mapped to quality scores using a simple linear regressor, eliminating expensive fine-tuning.5. Extensive experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale image quality assessment datasets with real and synthetic distortions. This demonstrates the efficacy of the unsupervised learned representations.In summary, the key novelty is in the unsupervised learning of complementary low-level quality and high-level content representations, which when combined provide state-of-the-art image quality assessment performance without requiring fine-tuning on each dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA to generate complementary content and quality-aware image representations for the challenging task of no-reference image quality assessment.

The main novelty is the ability to learn low-level quality representations that complement high-level content features in an unsupervised manner.The overall summary would be:The paper introduces Re-IQA, an unsupervised learning framework to generate complementary content and quality-aware image representations for no-reference image quality assessment by training two encoders with contrastive learning, which are then combined with a regressor to predict quality scores.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points on how this paper compares to other research in image quality assessment:- The paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach to image quality assessment called Re-IQA. This is different from many existing methods that require supervised learning on human-labeled image quality datasets. The unsupervised approach could enable broader applications without needing large labeled datasets.- The paper uses a "mixture of experts" framework with two ResNet encoders to separately learn high-level image content features and low-level quality features. This is a unique aspect compared to other methods that learn a single combined representation. - Re-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple image quality assessment benchmarks, including both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets. This demonstrates the method's effectiveness across different types of distortions.- Re-IQA does not require fine-tuning the feature encoders on each test dataset, unlike some methods like MUSIQ. The generalized features transfer well to multiple datasets, showing the robustness of the learned representations.- The method is compared comprehensively to various traditional and deep learning NR and FR-IQA techniques. The results show Re-IQA achieves very competitive accuracy to recent leading methods like PaQ-2-PiQ, HyperIQA, and MUSIQ.- The design of the image augmentation scheme and intra-pair swapping strategy for learning the quality features is novel and guided by principles of human perception. This allows learning representations closely aligned with perceptual quality.- The analysis shows high-level content features dominate for authentic distortions, while quality features dominate for synthetic distortions. This provides useful insights into the differences between the two domains.Overall, the unsupervised learning framework, along with the mixture of content and quality features, allows Re-IQA to advance the state-of-the-art in a challenging problem space. The comparison to other methods clearly demonstrates the competitiveness of the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the Re-IQA framework to transformer-based architectures like MUSIQ. The current work uses ResNet architectures, but the authors mention the framework could be generalized to transformers in the future.- Further exploring how the content and quality aware representations learned by Re-IQA could be useful for video quality assessment. The authors suggest the features from Re-IQA could be integrated as a spatial feature extraction module in video quality models.- Evaluating the impact of different choices of encoder architectures on the performance of Re-IQA. The current work focuses on ResNet encoders, but the framework seems flexible enough to work with other CNN and transformer encoders as well.- Conducting more in-depth analysis on cross-dataset performance to better understand the transferability and generalizability of the learned representations. The authors demonstrate promising cross-dataset results but suggest more extensive analysis could provide further insights.- Extending the framework to other conditional image generation tasks beyond quality assessment, such as style transfer, colorization, etc. The authors propose the core ideas of learning complementary content and condition representations could apply more broadly.Overall, the main directions seem focused on extending the framework to new architectures and tasks, and better understanding the transferability of the learned representations. Evaluating Re-IQA on video data and with different model architectures appear to be the most concrete next steps proposed.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA for image quality assessment, particularly for images "in the wild" with authentic distortions. The key idea is to train two separate encoders, one to learn high-level image content features and one to learn complementary low-level image quality features.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA for image quality assessment. The key idea is to train two separate encoders using contrastive learning - one encoder focuses on learning high-level image content features while the other learns complementary low-level image quality features. The framework has three main phases. First, a content-aware encoder is pre-trained using MoCo-v2 on ImageNet to extract semantic image features. Second, a quality-aware encoder is trained using a novel augmentation and image swapping method to learn perceptual quality features. Finally, the frozen encoders are used to extract image representations which are input to a regressor to predict quality scores. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets with both synthetic and authentic distortions. The framework demonstrates how unsupervised deep learning can produce useful representations for predicting perceptual image quality without manual labels. Key innovations include the mixture of content and quality experts and the novel augmentation scheme for learning distortions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes an unsupervised learning framework called Re-IQA to learn complementary content and quality representations for image quality assessment. The key ideas are:- Uses a Mixture of Experts approach with two ResNet50 encoders. One encoder is trained with MoCo v2 on ImageNet to learn high-level content features. The second encoder is trained with a modified MoCo v2 framework including novel image augmentation and intra-pair swapping to learn low-level quality features. - The image augmentation scheme applies random distortions like blur, noise, JPEG compression etc. to generate distorted versions of each image in a minibatch. Overlapping crops are taken from the original and distorted images and paired as similar/different quality samples for contrastive learning.- Intra-pair swapping pairs distorted versions of the same image as different quality to force the model to look beyond content.- The two pretrained encoders are used as fixed feature extractors. Their outputs are fed to a simple regressor to predict quality scores. No fine-tuning of encoders is needed for each dataset.- Experiments show content features dominate for authentic distortions while quality features are more useful for synthetic distortions. Combining both representations gives state-of-the-art performance on multiple IQA datasets.In summary, the key novelty is the unsupervised learning of complementary content and quality representations via modified MoCo, which are highly effective for image quality assessment without requiring fine-tuning on each dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of image quality assessment (IQA) in the wild, where reference images are not available. Specifically, it focuses on developing a no-reference IQA model that can accurately predict perceptual image quality on authentically distorted images found on social media and the internet. The key questions/goals of this paper are:- How to learn perceptual image quality features in an unsupervised manner, without relying on distorted-pristine image pairs or human quality scores during training.- How to learn complementary high-level (content-related) and low-level (quality-related) image representations that capture different aspects affecting perceived image quality. - How to effectively combine the learned high-level and low-level features to predict perceptual quality scores on real-world distorted images.To summarize, this paper aims to develop an unsupervised deep learning framework (Re-IQA) to extract robust image representations that correlate well with human judgments of perceptual quality for in-the-wild images. The novelty lies in learning complementary content and quality-aware features in a completely unsupervised manner.
