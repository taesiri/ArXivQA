# [Continuous Prompt Generation from Linear Combination of Discrete Prompt   Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10323)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Continuous prompts for large language models can lead to unintended and unpredictable behaviors, especially for sensitive applications like resume screening. This lack of interpretability is called "waywardness".

- Discrete prompts designed by humans are interpretable but lack the versatility and scalability of continuous prompts.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent continuous prompts as a linear combination of discrete prompt embeddings. Train a model to predict good weights for combining discrete prompts.

- This allows retaining the interpretability of discrete prompts while having the versatility of continuous prompts.

Methods:
- Authors manually designed 4 discrete prompts eliciting diverse problem-solving strategies. 

- Embedded prompts and fed them into a feedforward neural net to predict weights for linear combination.

- Trained on AI2 Reasoning Challenge dataset using cross-entropy loss from BART predictions.

Results: 
- Reduced cross-entropy loss compared to BART without prompt, indicating better performance.

- Analysis of predicted weights provides insight into which prompts are most relevant for different questions.

- More analytical prompts weighted higher on logical/scientific dataset. Aligns with human intuition.

Main Contributions:
- Novel method to construct versatile continuous prompts from interpretable discrete prompts

- Demonstrated improved loss and interpretability compared to vanilla continuous prompts

- Shows promise for scaling discrete prompting while avoiding unintended behaviors

Limitations:
- Limited testing on specialized NLU tasks 

- Possible impact of prompt basis set on performance needs more exploration
