# [Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common heart arrhythmia that increases risk of stroke and heart failure. Interpreting the irregular electrical activity in AFib cases is challenging.  
- Intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) offer detailed, localized data on heart activity and are ideal for interpretable cardiac studies. However, analyzing EGMs, especially in AFib cases, remains difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors represent EGMs as textual sequences by discretizing and encoding the continuous signal amplitudes into tokens.
- They employ masked language models (MLMs) like BigBird and LongFormer pretrained on large text corpora to predict randomly masked tokens in the EGM sequence.
- The model is trained to simultaneously interpolate the masked EGM tokens and classify sequences as AFib or normal.

Main Contributions:
- First work to formulate EGMs as textual sequences and apply powerful MLMs for analysis.
- Achieves 99.7% accuracy for AFib classification, outperforming prior image and time series based methods.
- Provides comprehensive model interpretability analysis using attention maps, integrated gradients, and counterfactual evaluation.
- Sets strong baseline for using pretrained language models to interpret complex physiological signals like EGMs.

In summary, this paper pioneers a textual representation of EGMs that enables leveraging state-of-the-art MLMs for accurate and interpretable analysis relevant to cardiac arrhythmias like AFib. The multi-faceted evaluation provides clinical applicability.
