# [JAMDEC: Unsupervised Authorship Obfuscation using Constrained Decoding   over Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08761)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Authorship obfuscation is important for online privacy and anonymity but poses unique challenges compared to other authorship tasks like paraphrasing or style transfer. 
- Current methods either don't modify enough to conceal identity, lose grammar/fluency, require extra training data, or rely on large proprietary models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces JAMBDEC, an unsupervised algorithm for authorship obfuscation at inference time using smaller, open-source language models. 
- It has 3 main stages - keyword extraction, over-generation of candidates via constrained diverse beam search, and filtering using NLI and grammar scores.
- Keyword extraction uses likelihood scores from smaller LMs to identify important tokens. 
- Constrained diverse beam search boosts smaller LMs by promoting diversity while ensuring keyword constraints are met.
- The filtering stage enables user control over final selections based on content and quality thresholds.

Main Contributions:
- Lightweight unsupervised approach to authorship obfuscation using smaller, non-proprietary LMs.
- Novel constrained decoding algorithm to enhance creativity of smaller LMs. 
- Flexible 3-stage pipeline allowing user control over process and outcomes.
- Strong performance - outperforms previous SoTA small model methods and is competitive with 175B model.
- Achieves better balance between obfuscation, content preservation and language quality.

In summary, the paper presents JAMBDEC, a new unsupervised algorithm using smaller LMs that pushes the boundaries of what is possible for authorship obfuscation without large proprietary models. Its constrained decoding approach combined with configurable filtering offers an customizable solution that demonstrates strong performance across metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes JAMBDEC, an unsupervised inference-time authorship obfuscation method that uses constrained decoding over small language models to rewrite text while preserving content and quality, and shows it is competitive with significantly larger proprietary models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing JAMBDEC, a new unsupervised algorithm for authorship obfuscation. Specifically:

1) JAMBDEC is a lightweight, user-controlled, inference-time algorithm that can obfuscate text on-the-fly using small language models like GPT-2. This makes it more flexible, customizable and privacy-preserving compared to methods relying on large proprietary models. 

2) The key idea behind JAMBDEC is to boost the creative power of smaller LMs through constrained decoding. It automatically extracts keywords to guide the decoding process and promote content preservation. Meanwhile, the incorporation of diverse beam search encourages output diversity to achieve obfuscation. 

3) Through experiments on scholarly and diary-style datasets, JAMBDEC is shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods using similarly sized models. It also balances the trade-offs between obfuscation, content preservation and language quality more effectively.

4) Remarkably, JAMBDEC built on a small 1.5B parameter model obtains competitive performance compared to the much larger proprietary 175B GPT-3 model, demonstrating the viability of algorithmically enhancing smaller models.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of JAMBDEC, a new unsupervised and customizable algorithm leveraging constrained decoding over small LMs to achieve strong authorship obfuscation performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Authorship obfuscation - The main task focused on in the paper, which involves rewriting text to conceal the original author's identity and writing style.

- Constrained decoding - A key technique used in the proposed method, JAMDec, which generates text under lexical constraints to preserve content while encouraging diversity. 

- User-controlled - The paper emphasizes JAMDec as a user-controlled approach that allows flexibility and fine-grained control over the obfuscation process.

- Unsupervised - JAMDec is presented as an unsupervised, inference-time algorithm that can obfuscate text on-the-fly without training data.

- Small language models - The method uses smaller, open-source language models like GPT-2 to avoid issues around privacy and compute resources compared to large proprietary models.

- Content preservation - A core goal of authorship obfuscation focused on maintaining the meaning and information content between the original and obfuscated text.

- Language quality - Along with content, assessing the fluency and grammatical correctness of generated text is important for evaluation.

- Style concealment - Quantifying how well a method conceals the original author's writing style using attribution models. 

- Task score - An aggregate performance measure combining style concealment, content preservation, and language quality metrics.

Some other notable terms include constrained diverse beam search, keyword extraction, over-generation, filtering, and the benchmarks used (AMT dataset, Blog dataset).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new method for keyword extraction based on token likelihoods from language models. How does this method for identifying important keywords compare to existing embedding-based approaches like KeyBERT? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages?

2. The paper proposes combining Constrained Beam Search and Diverse Beam Search into a single decoding algorithm called Constrained Diverse Beam Search (CDBS). What is the intuition behind blending these two approaches? How does CDBS aim to balance content preservation and style obfuscation? 

3. The filtering stage involves thresholding generation candidates based on NLI and CoLA scores. How were these threshold values determined or optimized? How sensitive is overall performance to changes in these threshold hyperparameters?

4. For sentences where no candidates pass the NLI and CoLA thresholds, the paper compares simply using the original sentence versus applying a basic stylometric obfuscator. When is retaining the original sentence preferable? In what cases might the stylometric approach be better?

5. The paper demonstrates that combining multiple keyword extraction techniques leads to better overall obfuscation performance. Why might blending likelihoods, embeddings, etc. produce superior keywords compared to any individual approach alone?

6. How does the choice of language model size (e.g. GPT-2 vs GPT-3) impact the quality of the keyword extraction? Is there a sweet spot that balances compute constraints with extraction ability?

7. The paper introduces a new metric called "Task Score" that equally weights obfuscation, content preservation, and fluency. What are the potential limitations of this scalar measure compared to analyzing the dimensions individually?

8. For the human evaluation, workers saw original and obfuscated passages side-by-side. Could presenting them independently or in a randomized order reduce bias? How else might the evaluation protocol be improved?

9. The method is applied at the sentence level. How might obfuscating at the paragraph or document level introduce new challenges? Would the approach need to be modified?

10. The paper focuses on authorship obfuscation for formal articles and blog posts. How might the approach perform for other text genres like social media, dialogue, or literary prose? Would domain adaptation of the models be beneficial?
