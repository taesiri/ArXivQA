# [Post-Processing Temporal Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14924)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How can we improve the performance of existing temporal action detection (TAD) models by alleviating the issue of temporal quantization error introduced during the preprocessing step of converting videos into fixed-length snippet representations? 

The central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the start and end times of actions with a Gaussian distribution and using a Gaussian approximation method to enable sub-snippet level inference can help reduce this quantization error and improve detection performance without needing to retrain models.

In essence, the paper investigates the problem of temporal resolution reduction during video preprocessing for TAD and proposes a new model-agnostic post-processing method called Gaussian Approximated Post-Processing (GAP) to address the resulting quantization error issue. The goal is to boost TAD performance without model modifications.
