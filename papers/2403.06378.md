# [Eliminating Warping Shakes for Unsupervised Online Video Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06378)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Eliminating Warping Shakes for Unsupervised Online Video Stitching":

Problem: 
The paper identifies a new problem called "warping shake" that occurs when extending image stitching methods to video stitching. Specifically, although image stitching methods can produce good alignments for individual frames, they introduce temporal instability (shakes) in the stitched non-overlapping regions over time. This happens even when the input videos are stable. 

Proposed Solution:
To eliminate warping shakes, the paper proposes "StabStitch", the first unsupervised online video stitching method that jointly performs video stitching and video stabilization. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Derive the formulation of "stitching trajectories" that represent the camera motions in the warped video by combining spatial and temporal warps. 
(2) Design an efficient "warp smoothing" model to optimize the stitching trajectories to achieve alignment, smoothness over time, spatial consistency, and online collaboration.
(3) Operate in an online mode with a sliding window over frames to enable real-time low-latency video stitching.

Main Contributions:
- Identify warping shake issue in video stitching.
- Propose the first unsupervised online solution StabStitch to simultaneously accomplish stitching and stabilization. 
- Derive stitching trajectories by integrating spatial and temporal warps.
- Design effective warp smoothing model with comprehensive optimization goals.
- Build a new challenging benchmark for video stitching evaluation.
- Achieve superior performance over state-of-the-arts in robustness, speed, and stitching/stabilization quality.

The main highlights are the new perspective on video stitching, the unsupervised online solution, and the comprehensive evaluations demonstrating advantages over previous image and video stitching techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes StabStitch, an unsupervised online video stitching framework that simultaneously realizes video stitching and video stabilization by generating and smoothing stitching trajectories to eliminate warping shakes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Retargeting video stitching to an emerging issue called "warping shake", which describes the undesired content instability in non-overlapping regions when extending image stitching to videos.

2. Proposing StabStitch, the first unsupervised online video stitching solution that realizes video stitching and stabilization simultaneously in a unified learning framework. 

3. Building a holistic video stitching dataset with diverse scenes and camera motions that can serve as a benchmark and promote related research.

4. Achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art image and video stitching methods in terms of scene robustness, inference speed, and stitching/stabilization effect.

In summary, the key innovation is presenting a new perspective on video stitching by identifying and addressing the warping shake issue, as well as designing an effective unsupervised online solution with strong practicality. The dataset and comprehensive experiments also demonstrate the advantages over existing methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces the concept of "warping shake" to describe the temporal instability in non-overlapping regions when extending image stitching to video stitching. Can you elaborate on why warping shakes occur and how they are problematic?

2) The proposed StabStitch method makes the assumption that input videos are already stable. Why is this a reasonable assumption given current video capture technology? How does this differ from assumptions made in prior video stitching work? 

3) Explain the key ideas behind formulating stitching trajectories by combining spatial and temporal meshes. What is the intuition behind representing trajectories this way?

4) The warp smoothing model contains several loss terms. Explain the motivation and effect of the data term, smoothness term, and spatial consistency term. How do they balance different objectives?  

5) What specific network architecture choices were made in the spatial warp, temporal warp, and warp smoothing models? Why were these choices made over other options?

6) The method performs online smoothing using a sliding window approach. What is the rationale behind only using backward frames? What issue arose from this and how was it addressed?

7) How exactly is the dynamic inference strategy adjusting the balance between distortion and stability? What are the tradeoffs it is making?

8) What were the key weaknesses you observed in prior video stitching methods? How does StabStitch overcome them?

9) The paper introduces a new dataset. What are its key characteristics? Why was it necessary to create this dataset?

10) If you were to extend this work further, what limitations would you aim to address and how? What future directions seem promising?
