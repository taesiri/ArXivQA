# [Eliminating Warping Shakes for Unsupervised Online Video Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06378)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Eliminating Warping Shakes for Unsupervised Online Video Stitching":

Problem: 
The paper identifies a new problem called "warping shake" that occurs when extending image stitching methods to video stitching. Specifically, although image stitching methods can produce good alignments for individual frames, they introduce temporal instability (shakes) in the stitched non-overlapping regions over time. This happens even when the input videos are stable. 

Proposed Solution:
To eliminate warping shakes, the paper proposes "StabStitch", the first unsupervised online video stitching method that jointly performs video stitching and video stabilization. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Derive the formulation of "stitching trajectories" that represent the camera motions in the warped video by combining spatial and temporal warps. 
(2) Design an efficient "warp smoothing" model to optimize the stitching trajectories to achieve alignment, smoothness over time, spatial consistency, and online collaboration.
(3) Operate in an online mode with a sliding window over frames to enable real-time low-latency video stitching.

Main Contributions:
- Identify warping shake issue in video stitching.
- Propose the first unsupervised online solution StabStitch to simultaneously accomplish stitching and stabilization. 
- Derive stitching trajectories by integrating spatial and temporal warps.
- Design effective warp smoothing model with comprehensive optimization goals.
- Build a new challenging benchmark for video stitching evaluation.
- Achieve superior performance over state-of-the-arts in robustness, speed, and stitching/stabilization quality.

The main highlights are the new perspective on video stitching, the unsupervised online solution, and the comprehensive evaluations demonstrating advantages over previous image and video stitching techniques.
