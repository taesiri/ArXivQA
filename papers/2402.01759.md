# [Systematic Literature Review: Computational Approaches for Humour Style   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on computational approaches for humour style classification and related tasks like binary humour recognition and sarcasm detection. The paper notes that while humour styles play an important role in areas like psychology, mental health, and relationships, computational research on humour styles is still limited. Most existing work has focused on binary humour/sarcasm detection rather than categorizing humour into different styles. The paper thus aims to analyze computational techniques used for related tasks and their potential transferability to humour style classification.

Methodology:
The authors systematically reviewed papers on computational humour and sarcasm detection published in the last 10 years. They extracted information on datasets used, features extracted, computational models applied, and performance metrics. In total, they analyzed 59 relevant papers. The research questions guiding the SLR focused on: (1) availability of open humour/sarcasm datasets (2) commonly extracted features (3) computational techniques used (4) strengths/limitations of existing approaches.

Key Findings: 
- 39 humour/sarcasm datasets were identified, most based on social media data. 22 were manually labeled while 15 used distant supervision.
- Key features extracted included linguistic, semantic, sentiment, acoustic and visual features. Text features focused on incongruity, ambiguity, phonetic aspects etc. 
- Computational models applied ranged from SVM, Naive Bayes, CNNs, LSTMs to transformer models like BERT. Specialized neural models designed explicitly for humour/sarcasm tasks were also common.
- Transformer models performed very well on textual humour/sarcasm detection. Specialized models outperformed BERT/RoBERTa by 3-8% in some papers.

Potential Transferability to Humour Styles:
- Features like incongruity, sentiment, subjectivity, linguistic markers, acoustic and visual cues show high promise for humour style classification.
- A range of classical ML models, neural networks and transformer models already applied to related tasks could be suitable for humour styles after customization.

Key Limitations:
- Most models struggle to handle subjectivity and contextual dependencies in humour
- Social media datasets may not generalize across domains
- Humour style specific datasets needed
- Complex models like BERT have high overhead  

Future Research Directions:  
- Develop more balanced and multidomain humour style datasets
- Adopt techniques to reduce dataset bias and enhance labelling quality
- Explore multiclass classification across four humour styles
- Improve multimodal feature integration from text, audio and visual
- Leverage transfer learning instead of training models from scratch
