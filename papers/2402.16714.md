# [Quantum linear algebra is all you need for Transformer architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models like GPT have revolutionized text and image generation but require massive computational resources. The transformer architecture is a key component in these models. 
- Quantum computers have shown promise for speedups in linear algebra tasks. This paper investigates whether quantum computers could provide any speedup for transformer architectures used in large language models.

Challenges:  
- Large language models use huge datasets which is difficult to load into small, current quantum computers.
- Large language models have billions of parameters while current quantum computers only have ~100 qubits. 
- Quantum states cannot be cloned, so saving intermediate states is difficult.

Approach:
- Focus on inference of predicting the next token in a sequence rather than full training.
- Assume access to pretrained weight matrices encoded into quantum circuits. 
- Construct and analyze pertinent quantum subroutines for key transformer blocks - attention, residual connections, feedforward network.
- Output is a quantum state encoding the transformer output, which can be measured or sampled.

Key Contributions:
- Element-wise application of polynomial functions to matrix entries. 
- Efficient softmax computation for attention using Hadamard products.
- Converting between quantum state and matrix encodings.
- Constructing quantum versions of transformer blocks: self-attention, residual connections, feedforward network.  
- Combined quantum subroutines into full single-layer transformer circuit.

The paper makes technical contributions towards constructing transformer architectures on quantum computers, though many open questions around multi-layer models, achieving quantum advantage, input encoding, and training remain.
