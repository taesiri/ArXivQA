# [Transformer-based Vulnerability Detection in Code at EditTime:   Zero-shot, Few-shot, or Fine-tuning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01754)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions it aims to address are:1) How effective is the authors' vulnerability detection model compared to results from state-of-the-art models on established benchmark datasets?2) To what extent is the proposed vulnerability detection model effective in reducing the vulnerability rate of code language models?The authors develop a neural network-based vulnerability detection model that can detect vulnerabilities in incomplete code snippets in real-time as developers are writing code. They explore different learning approaches like zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning for training the model.To evaluate their approach, the authors conduct two main experiments:1) They compare their model against existing vulnerability detection models on four widely used benchmark datasets. This aims to evaluate how their model performs on established datasets.2) They test their model's ability to detect vulnerable code patterns generated by code language models. This evaluates the model's effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities in auto-generated code.So in summary, the two main research questions focus on benchmarking their model's performance against prior work, and testing its ability to detect vulnerabilities in code language model outputs. The central hypothesis seems to be that their neural model can effectively detect vulnerabilities in real-time, even on incomplete code, compared to prior methods.
