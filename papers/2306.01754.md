# [Transformer-based Vulnerability Detection in Code at EditTime:   Zero-shot, Few-shot, or Fine-tuning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01754)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions it aims to address are:1) How effective is the authors' vulnerability detection model compared to results from state-of-the-art models on established benchmark datasets?2) To what extent is the proposed vulnerability detection model effective in reducing the vulnerability rate of code language models?The authors develop a neural network-based vulnerability detection model that can detect vulnerabilities in incomplete code snippets in real-time as developers are writing code. They explore different learning approaches like zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning for training the model.To evaluate their approach, the authors conduct two main experiments:1) They compare their model against existing vulnerability detection models on four widely used benchmark datasets. This aims to evaluate how their model performs on established datasets.2) They test their model's ability to detect vulnerable code patterns generated by code language models. This evaluates the model's effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities in auto-generated code.So in summary, the two main research questions focus on benchmarking their model's performance against prior work, and testing its ability to detect vulnerabilities in code language model outputs. The central hypothesis seems to be that their neural model can effectively detect vulnerabilities in real-time, even on incomplete code, compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a practical system for detecting vulnerable code patterns in incomplete code snippets at edit time using deep learning. Specifically:- The paper develops a vulnerability detection model that can identify vulnerabilities in incomplete code snippets on the order of milliseconds, allowing it to serve developers interactively while coding. - It explores and compares six model variations using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning approaches with different pre-trained language models like CodeBERT and Codex.- It shows the model improves recall by up to 10% and precision by up to 8% over state-of-the-art vulnerability detection models on established benchmark datasets.- It demonstrates the model's effectiveness in reducing vulnerability rates in code completions from large language models by over 90% on a benchmark of high-risk code scenarios. - It discusses lessons from deploying the model in a production VSCode extension, resulting in 80% reduction in vulnerabilities.In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating a practical deep learning based system for interactively detecting vulnerabilities as developers are writing code, both manually or using auto-generated suggestions.
