# [Transformer-based Vulnerability Detection in Code at EditTime:   Zero-shot, Few-shot, or Fine-tuning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01754)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions it aims to address are:1) How effective is the authors' vulnerability detection model compared to results from state-of-the-art models on established benchmark datasets?2) To what extent is the proposed vulnerability detection model effective in reducing the vulnerability rate of code language models?The authors develop a neural network-based vulnerability detection model that can detect vulnerabilities in incomplete code snippets in real-time as developers are writing code. They explore different learning approaches like zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning for training the model.To evaluate their approach, the authors conduct two main experiments:1) They compare their model against existing vulnerability detection models on four widely used benchmark datasets. This aims to evaluate how their model performs on established datasets.2) They test their model's ability to detect vulnerable code patterns generated by code language models. This evaluates the model's effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities in auto-generated code.So in summary, the two main research questions focus on benchmarking their model's performance against prior work, and testing its ability to detect vulnerabilities in code language model outputs. The central hypothesis seems to be that their neural model can effectively detect vulnerabilities in real-time, even on incomplete code, compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a practical system for detecting vulnerable code patterns in incomplete code snippets at edit time using deep learning. Specifically:- The paper develops a vulnerability detection model that can identify vulnerabilities in incomplete code snippets on the order of milliseconds, allowing it to serve developers interactively while coding. - It explores and compares six model variations using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning approaches with different pre-trained language models like CodeBERT and Codex.- It shows the model improves recall by up to 10% and precision by up to 8% over state-of-the-art vulnerability detection models on established benchmark datasets.- It demonstrates the model's effectiveness in reducing vulnerability rates in code completions from large language models by over 90% on a benchmark of high-risk code scenarios. - It discusses lessons from deploying the model in a production VSCode extension, resulting in 80% reduction in vulnerabilities.In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating a practical deep learning based system for interactively detecting vulnerabilities as developers are writing code, both manually or using auto-generated suggestions.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a deep learning-based system to detect vulnerable code patterns in incomplete code snippets at edit time, shows it improves over prior work, and demonstrates its effectiveness at reducing vulnerabilities in code generated by large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of vulnerability detection in code:- The key contribution of this paper is developing a vulnerability detection model that can operate on incomplete code snippets during edit time. Most prior work has focused on detecting vulnerabilities in complete code fragments like functions or source files. Operating on incomplete code snippets allows the model to provide instant feedback to developers as they are typing code.- The paper explores using different learning approaches like zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuning on large pre-trained language models for vulnerability detection. Prior work has mainly focused on feature engineering and training custom models. Leveraging pre-trained LLMs allows capturing more complex vulnerabilities without extensive feature engineering.- The paper evaluates the model on common benchmark datasets from prior work and shows improved recall and precision over state-of-the-art models like VulDeePecker, SySeVR, and Devign. This demonstrates the benefit of pre-trained LLM approaches.- A key novel experiment is evaluating the model's ability to detect vulnerabilities in completions generated by code LLMs. This is an important emerging application as code LLM usage increases. The paper shows a significant reduction in vulnerability rate when filtering code LLM outputs.- The paper discusses deployment in a production VSCode extension which few other papers have demonstrated. The reported reduction in vulnerability rate in real developer code shows the efficacy of edit-time detection.Overall, the key novelty of enabling edit-time vulnerability detection using pre-trained LLMs sets this work apart from prior research. The thorough evaluation on benchmarks and novel experiments on code LLM outputs also demonstrate the real-world applicability of the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding the vulnerability detection model's coverage by adding new types of vulnerabilities to the training set. The authors note that as their model catches more common vulnerabilities early on, users may start to notice the more uncommon vulnerabilities, which could hurt trust over time. Expanding the training data could help address this.- Measuring the long-term effect of the vulnerability detection model on the overall developer experience when using the VSCode extension. The authors suggest collecting metrics like vulnerability reduction rate, whether the file resulted in a failing unit test, or whether a vulnerability was still caught later in the process after edit time. This could provide more insight into the real-world impact.- Applying a similar deep learning based vulnerability detection approach to other tools and contexts beyond VSCode where usage telemetry is available. The authors mention they have already deployed a similar system for Azure PowerShell and found success.- Investigating the use of larger neural network models. The authors currently use a relatively small model for low latency, but note larger models could be feasible with better hardware to improve inference time. The tradeoff between model size and response time could be further explored.- Continuing to tune the prediction threshold to balance positive rate and recall based on long-term monitoring and user feedback. The right balance is important for maximizing benefit while minimizing friction.- Comparing the effectiveness of different learning approaches like zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning as model size increases. The authors currently find fine-tuning works best, but this may change with larger models.In summary, the main directions are expanding coverage, measuring real-world impact, applying the approach more broadly, using larger models, tuning the prediction threshold, and comparing learning approaches as models scale up.
