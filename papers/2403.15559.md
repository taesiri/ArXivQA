# [An Optimization Framework to Enforce Multi-View Consistency for   Texturing 3D Meshes Using Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating multi-view consistent textures for 3D meshes from text prompts using pre-trained text-to-image models is challenging. Existing methods either struggle to retain high-quality details from the text-to-image outputs due to averaging, or overfit rendered images leading to loss of realistic details. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a four-stage optimization framework - 
1) View Generation: Generate an overcomplete set of textured views from multiple viewpoints using a multi-view consistent diffusion model.
2) View Selection: Select a consistent and complete subset of views by optimizing a quadratic assignment problem using semidefinite programming.
3) View Alignment: Perform joint non-rigid alignment of selected views across overlapping regions using color adjustment and image warping.  
4) Texture Stitching: Associate mesh faces to selected views by optimizing a Markov random field (MRF) formulation. Stitch texture views using cuts from MRF.

The last two stages are iterated by using the cuts to refine alignment regions and improve consistency.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework combining view generation, selection, alignment and stitching to enforce multi-view consistency.
- View selection method using semidefinite programming for consistency and coverage.
- Joint non-rigid alignment of selected views across overlaps.
- MRF formulation for texture stitching and cut optimization.  
- Alternating optimization between alignment and stitching to improve consistency.

The method achieves higher-quality, more detailed and multi-view consistent texturing compared to state-of-the-art approaches as demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively.
