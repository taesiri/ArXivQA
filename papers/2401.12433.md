# [A Novel Garment Transfer Method Supervised by Distilled Knowledge of   Virtual Try-on Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12433)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Garment transfer aims to transfer a garment from one person image to another. It allows online shoppers to visualize how a garment would look on them. However, unlike virtual try-on where paired data of person image and try-on result is available, there is no ground truth pairing for garment transfer. This makes it very difficult to supervise the training of garment transfer models. Previous works have treated it as either a pose transfer task within the same person or garment-pose disentanglement, which does not fully conform to the true intentions of garment transfer.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes to use knowledge distillation to train a garment transfer model by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained virtual try-on model. The pipeline involves:

1) Transfer Parsing Reasoning: A student model is trained to predict the parsing where one person wears the garment of another. This provides shape guidance for subsequent steps. The training has three phases - teaching feature knowledge, response knowledge and self-study from ground truth. 

2) Garment Warping: The garment image is precisely warped to match the shape of the predicted parsing. This uses an initial alignment step and then a flow warping step to match at both shape and texture levels. Knowledge of warping from virtual try-on is distilled to supervise this model.

3) Arm Regrowth: A specialized model propagates the arm region and also handles cases where new skin needs to be exposed. 

4) Final image synthesis by combining the warped garment, propagated body parts and arm regrowth output.

Main Contributions:

- First work to use knowledge distillation from virtual try-on to supervise garment transfer network

- Delicate multi-phase teaching strategy to train the transfer parsing reasoning model 

- Garment warping method involving initial alignment and progressive flow estimation for precise matching  

- Specialized arm regrowth model to infer new skin regions

The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other garment transfer and virtual try-on methods, especially in preserving texture details and body features after transfer.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel garment transfer method supervised by knowledge distillation from virtual try-on, which teaches transfer parsing reasoning and garment warping models via multi-phase distillation and flow estimation with shape-content correspondence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Teaching transfer parsing reasoning in multi-phase. The transfer parsing reasoning model learns the response and feature knowledge from the try-on parsing reasoning model in garment transfer. It then transfers the garment back to its originator so that the transfer parsing reasoning model absorbs the hard knowledge from the ground truth to improve its robustness.

2) Supervising garment warping with the shape and content information. The paper first maps the garment to a similar position to the target shape. With the warping knowledge of garment-in-shop, a progressive flow is estimated to precisely warp the garment by learning the correspondence at both the shape and content level. 

3) Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has state-of-the-art performance compared to other virtual try-on and garment transfer methods in garment transfer. The method performs well in transfer parsing reasoning, garment warping, new skin inference, and final result synthesis regardless of the dressing and pose of the person images.

In summary, the main contribution is a new garment transfer method that is supervised by knowledge distillation from a virtual try-on model. This allows effective transfer parsing reasoning and precise garment warping to achieve state-of-the-art results.
