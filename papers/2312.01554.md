# [Building Ears for Robots: Machine Hearing in the Age of Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01554)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper discusses the importance of machine hearing systems for robots operating in real-world environments. It first provides an overview of the hardware design challenges, principles, and testing methods for exterior microphone arrays on autonomous vehicles, using robotaxis as a case study. It then explores potential roles for robot hearing within probabilistic robotic software frameworks, including Bayes filters, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and multiagent systems. The paper argues that the meaning of a sound for a robot depends heavily on the context of the robot's sequential decision-making process. Therefore, rather than studying robotic hearing in isolation, it should be incorporated with actions and planning for improved state estimation, policy generation, and interaction with other agents. Overall, as service robots evolve in complexity and capabilities, so too should their hearing systems to support robust operation in noisy, uncertain environments alongside human collaborators.
