# [Counterfactual Analysis of Neural Networks Used to Create Fertilizer   Management Zones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Precision agriculture aims to optimize crop productivity and fertilizer efficiency by using management zones (MZs) that account for within-field variability. 
- Existing methods for determining MZs do not explicitly consider fertilizer responsivity, which is critical for tailored fertilizer management.
- Lack of explainability in current MZ methods hinders understanding of why sites are assigned to certain zones.

Proposed Solution:
- Generate fertilizer-yield response (N-response) curves across the field using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to approximate yield outcomes across fertilizer rates.  
- Quantify shape dissimilarity of curves using functional principal component analysis (fPCA) as distance metric.
- Cluster field sites into MZs based on similarity of N-response curve shapes, so each MZ exhibits consistent fertilizer responsivity pattern.
- Apply counterfactual explanation (CFE) method to reveal influence of terrain factors on MZ assignments. Identifies minimal feature changes needed to alter cluster membership.

Key Contributions:
- First MZ delineation method accounting for within-field variability of fertilizer responsivity based on CNN-generated response curves.  
- Adaptation of CFE technique to uncover causal relationships between passive features and MZ membership assignments.
- Experimental results on two crop fields demonstrate effectiveness in organizing sites into MZs with homogeneous fertilizer responsivity patterns.
- CFE analysis provides explanations regarding impact of terrain characteristics (e.g. slope, aspect) on fertilizer responsivity and zone assignments.
