# [Extreme Event Prediction with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning-based   Parametrization of Atmospheric and Oceanic Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
General circulation models (GCMs) are the main tools for predicting climate variability and change. However, due to their coarse spatial resolution, GCMs cannot resolve critical small-scale processes like atmospheric and oceanic turbulence. These unresolved processes have to be parametrized, i.e. represented, in terms of the resolved scales via closure models. The accuracy of these closures is key to capturing extreme events. Traditional closures rely on simplifying physics assumptions and often fail to accurately parametrize turbulence. Recently, data-driven supervised machine learning closures trained offline on high-fidelity data have shown improvements but require prohibitive training data and can cause model instability. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to learn parametrization closures for prototypes of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence. In MARL, the model grid points act as learning agents that take actions to maximize a reward related to matching turbulence statistics. This allows learning with only low-order turbulence statistics, avoiding model instability. The authors test MARL-learned Smagorinsky and Leith closure models on 2D quasi-geostrophic forced turbulence exhibiting multi-scale dynamics like those in Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

Main Contributions:
- First application of MARL to learn parametrizations and model closures for climate model prototypes exhibiting extreme events 
- Demonstrates MARL can successfully learn closures from low-order turbulence statistics, avoiding model instability  
- Shows learned MARL closures enable very coarse (160-10240x) LES models to accurately capture DNS turbulence statistics and extremes
- Suggests MARL is a promising data-efficient framework for developing closures in climate models to improve predictive skill, especially for extremes


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using multi-agent reinforcement learning to learn subgrid-scale closure models for atmospheric and oceanic turbulence simulations, with a focus on capturing extreme events.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop subgrid-scale (SGS) closure models for large eddy simulations (LES) of geophysical turbulent flows. Specifically:

- They train MARL-based SGS closures for 2D quasi-geostrophic turbulence prototypes exhibiting atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, using only low-order statistics like the enstrophy spectrum. 

- The MARL-based closures enable very coarse LES (100-10,000 times lower resolution than DNS) to accurately capture statistics and tails of probability density functions representing extreme events, significantly outperforming classical closure models.

- This demonstrates the potential of online MARL-based learning of SGS closures for climate model parametrizations using scarce/indirect data, particularly for capturing extreme weather/climate events.

In summary, the key novelty is using MARL with physics-based states and rewards to develop SGS closures for geophysical turbulence, and showing their accuracy and stability for capturing extreme event statistics using very little DNS data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the multi-agent reinforcement learning method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the choice of local state variables (i.e. the instantaneous invariants of filtered velocity gradients and Hessians) provide Galilean invariance to the learned closure models? What would happen if simpler local states like filtered velocities were used instead?

2) The global state uses the enstrophy spectrum estimated from only 10 DNS snapshots. Why is the enstrophy spectrum a good global state? How sensitive are the results to errors in estimating this spectrum from limited DNS data? 

3) How was the reward function designed to enable matching the target enstrophy spectrum? What alternatives were considered and why was the cumulative inverse $\ell_2$ error of the log spectra chosen?

4) The environment couples the Navier-Stokes solver to the MARL agents. What are the computational challenges of incorporating the full dynamics into the environment? Could surrogate modeling be used? 

5) How do the learned coefficients ($c_s$, $c_l$) of the Smagorinsky and Leith closures compare? What dynamics do they capture? How interpretable are they?

6) Why does the method focus on accurately capturing the tails of the vorticity PDFs? How do the extreme events relate to blocking events in the real atmosphere?

7) How do the stability and accuracy of the multi-resolution LES runs using the learned closures compare to classical dynamic closures? What causes the improved performance?

8) What type of model errors are introduced by the spectral filtering used to derive the LES equations? How might the closures compensate for these?

9) What additional physics could be embedded in the framework to improve generalizability? Could stability guarantees or constraints be enforced?

10) What are the main challenges in applying this MARL closure modeling approach in full 3D climate models compared to the 2D prototypes tested? How could the method scale?
