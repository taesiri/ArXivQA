# [Extreme Event Prediction with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning-based   Parametrization of Atmospheric and Oceanic Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
General circulation models (GCMs) are the main tools for predicting climate variability and change. However, due to their coarse spatial resolution, GCMs cannot resolve critical small-scale processes like atmospheric and oceanic turbulence. These unresolved processes have to be parametrized, i.e. represented, in terms of the resolved scales via closure models. The accuracy of these closures is key to capturing extreme events. Traditional closures rely on simplifying physics assumptions and often fail to accurately parametrize turbulence. Recently, data-driven supervised machine learning closures trained offline on high-fidelity data have shown improvements but require prohibitive training data and can cause model instability. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to learn parametrization closures for prototypes of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence. In MARL, the model grid points act as learning agents that take actions to maximize a reward related to matching turbulence statistics. This allows learning with only low-order turbulence statistics, avoiding model instability. The authors test MARL-learned Smagorinsky and Leith closure models on 2D quasi-geostrophic forced turbulence exhibiting multi-scale dynamics like those in Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

Main Contributions:
- First application of MARL to learn parametrizations and model closures for climate model prototypes exhibiting extreme events 
- Demonstrates MARL can successfully learn closures from low-order turbulence statistics, avoiding model instability  
- Shows learned MARL closures enable very coarse (160-10240x) LES models to accurately capture DNS turbulence statistics and extremes
- Suggests MARL is a promising data-efficient framework for developing closures in climate models to improve predictive skill, especially for extremes
