# [Engineering an Exact Pseudo-Boolean Model Counter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12341)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Model counting is an important task with applications in areas like software verification, machine learning, planning etc. It involves computing the number of satisfying assignments to a Boolean formula. While model counting for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has been extensively studied, there has been little work on counting for Pseudo-Boolean (PB) formulas. PB formulas are more succinct and expressive than CNF. So there is a need to investigate techniques for efficient PB model counting.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the first exact Pseudo-Boolean model counter called PBCount. It works by compiling the PB constraints into algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and then counting models using ADD operations. Two approaches are proposed for compiling PB constraints into ADDs - a bottom-up approach starting from literals/constants, and a top-down recursive approach using if-then-else operations. Optimizations are introduced in both approaches to reduce compilation time. A dynamic heuristic selects the best approach per constraint based on features like number of terms, constraint threshold etc. Basic preprocessing like unit propagation and failed literal detection is also implemented.

Main Contributions:
- First exact PB model counter PBCount that natively counts on PB formulas by compiling into ADDs
- Two approaches for PB to ADD compilation - bottom-up and top-down along with optimizations 
- A dynamic heuristic to select the best compilation approach per constraint
- Empirical evaluation showing PBCount solves significantly more instances than state-of-the-art CNF counters

The key advantage of native PB counting is highlighted. By avoiding the exponential blowup introduced in CNF conversion, PBCount outperforms existing solvers. This shows the promise of pursuing PB-native techniques. The paper opens up directions like PB specific preprocessing and non-compilation approaches for PB model counting.
