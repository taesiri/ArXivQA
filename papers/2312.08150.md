# [Active learning with biased non-response to label requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08150)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines how non-response to label requests can impact active learning model performance over time. The authors conceptualize two mechanisms through which non-response degrades performance: a volume effect from having fewer training examples, and an imbalance effect from biasing the distribution of training data. They demonstrate through simulations that biased non-response is more detrimental than random non-response. To mitigate this, they propose adjusting the active learning utility function by the probability of response, which they term UCB-EU. Experiments show their method improves performance in many cases by preventing wasted queries in low-response regions. However, in some cases non-response still forces suboptimal decision boundaries by restricting the observable feature space. The method is demonstrated in a real-world e-commerce recommendation scenario using Taobao data. Key findings are that UCB-EU leads to performance gains, but relies on having an accurate non-response model. The work provides both a better understanding of non-response in active learning, and a practical solution to help address it in contexts with implicit user labeling.
