# [Differentiable Particle Filtering using Optimal Placement Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Particle filters are useful numeric approximation methods for state inference and parameter learning in state-space models. However, the standard resampling step used to prevent particle degeneration is non-differentiable, which prohibits gradient-based optimization methods for model training.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a differentiable resampling scheme called optimal placement resampling (OPR). Instead of stochastic resampling, particles are deterministically moved to optimal locations based on an empirical cumulative distribution function constructed from the weighted particles to mimic the true posterior distribution.

- This is achieved by approximating the posterior pdf and cdf with weighted Heaviside step functions using the current particles and weights. The inverse cdf then allows deterministic computation of optimal particle locations that minimize the integral quadratic distance to the true posterior.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the OPR method for differentiable and deterministic particle resampling to enable gradient-based model learning.

- Empirical evaluation showing OPR provides lower variance gradient estimates compared to non-differentiable multinomial resampling, leading to better proposal distribution and parameter learning on toy and real-world models.

- Demonstration that OPR produces tighter ELBO bounds and higher likelihood estimates than standard particle filters in maximum likelihood estimation tasks.

Overall, the paper presents a novel differentiable resampling approach for particle filters that enables more effective gradient-based learning while preserving the core functionality for inference.
