# [Combinatorial Complexes: Bridging the Gap Between Cell Complexes and   Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph-based models are limited in representing complex relations found in high-dimensional data. Two main extensions beyond graphs have been explored - hypergraphs and cell complexes. 
- Hypergraphs effectively model set-type, multi-body relations but lack a coherent spectral theory. Cell complexes have a strong topological/geometric grounding enabling spectral analysis but emphasize boundary-interior hierarchical relations.
- Currently complexes are seen as a subclass of hypergraphs, but this fails to capture their distinct relational properties.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide an alternative perspective - hypergraphs and complexes emphasize different types of relations with different utility. 
- Hypergraphs excel at flexible set-type, multi-body couplings. Complexes excel at modeling hierarchical, boundary-interior relations grounded in topology/geometry.
- Introduce the concept of combinatorial complexes which accommodate both set-type and hierarchical relations.

Main Contributions:
- Challenge view of complexes as special hypergraphs - argues they represent fundamentally different relational structures
- Discusses relative advantages of hypergraphs (set-type relations) and complexes (hierarchical relations)
- Elaborates on combinatorial complexes to allow co-existing set-type and hierarchical relations
- Provides experiment showcasing advantage of learning over combinatorial complexes vs simplicial complexes

In summary, the key insight is that hypergraphs and complexes emphasize complementary types of relations, and should not be viewed in a subclass relationship. Combinatorial complexes are introduced to combine the benefits of both approaches in a flexible higher-order structure. An experiment demonstrates the potential gains from modeling the joint set-type and hierarchical relations in a learning task.
