# [Masked Wavelet Representation for Compact Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a more compact representation for neural radiance fields while maintaining high rendering quality. The key ideas proposed are:

- Using wavelet coefficients instead of raw spatial coefficients for grid-based neural radiance fields. This is hypothesized to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality compared to spatial representations.

- Introducing a trainable masking method to further increase sparsity of the wavelet coefficients by removing unnecessary coefficients. 

- Developing a compression pipeline to encode the sparse wavelet coefficients and masks into a compact representation.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that wavelet coefficients combined with trainable masking and compression techniques can lead to a significantly more compact neural radiance field representation without compromising rendering quality. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on various 3D scene datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing the use of wavelet transforms on grid-based neural radiance fields to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality. The authors show experimentally that wavelet coefficients can be more compact than spatial domain coefficients for representing neural radiance fields.

2. Introducing a novel trainable masking approach to achieve higher sparsity of grid coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality. The proposed masking method is able to zero out over 95% of grid parameters while causing only minor degradation in rendering quality.

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis under a tight memory budget of 2 MB. The combination of wavelet transforms and masking allows the method to represent scenes using very few parameters without compromising visual quality.

In summary, the key ideas are using wavelets and learned masks to enable highly compact representations of neural radiance fields. This improves on prior grid-based methods by significantly reducing the memory footprint while retaining high rendering fidelity. The experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using wavelet transforms and trainable masking on 2D plane-based neural radiance fields to achieve a highly compact scene representation, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to other methods on novel view synthesis tasks under a tight memory budget of 2MB.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on masked wavelet representations for neural radiance fields compares to other research in compact neural scene representations:

- It builds on recent work using grid-based representations like Instant-NGP and TensoRF to accelerate neural radiance field training and inference. The key novelty is using wavelet transforms and trainable masking to further improve the compactness and efficiency of these representations. 

- Compared to other works like KiloNeRF and hash-based approaches, it does not partition the scene or use discretization. Instead, it keeps a continuous neural representation and focuses on sparsifying the grid coefficients. This retains the advantages of neural representations while reducing redundancy.

- Relative to frequency-based approaches like Fourier features or transformer networks, it specifically employs wavelets for their localization properties and demonstrates advantages over raw spatial and DCT features. The masking further increases sparsity over just wavelets alone.

- The proposed pipeline with run-length and entropy coding for compressing the sparse masks is tailored for neural scene data, as opposed to reliance on generic compression schemes. This maximizes compression performance.

- Results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression rates for neural radiance fields under a 2MB budget, while retaining rendering quality on par with or better than much larger uncompressed baseline models.

Overall, the work pushes the boundaries of compact neural scene representation by judiciously modifying and combining techniques from classical compression and recent neural representation literature. The experiments validate the approach and show promising avenues for even more efficient rendering of complex 3D scenes.
