# [Masked Wavelet Representation for Compact Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a more compact representation for neural radiance fields while maintaining high rendering quality. The key ideas proposed are:

- Using wavelet coefficients instead of raw spatial coefficients for grid-based neural radiance fields. This is hypothesized to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality compared to spatial representations.

- Introducing a trainable masking method to further increase sparsity of the wavelet coefficients by removing unnecessary coefficients. 

- Developing a compression pipeline to encode the sparse wavelet coefficients and masks into a compact representation.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that wavelet coefficients combined with trainable masking and compression techniques can lead to a significantly more compact neural radiance field representation without compromising rendering quality. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on various 3D scene datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing the use of wavelet transforms on grid-based neural radiance fields to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality. The authors show experimentally that wavelet coefficients can be more compact than spatial domain coefficients for representing neural radiance fields.

2. Introducing a novel trainable masking approach to achieve higher sparsity of grid coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality. The proposed masking method is able to zero out over 95% of grid parameters while causing only minor degradation in rendering quality.

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis under a tight memory budget of 2 MB. The combination of wavelet transforms and masking allows the method to represent scenes using very few parameters without compromising visual quality.

In summary, the key ideas are using wavelets and learned masks to enable highly compact representations of neural radiance fields. This improves on prior grid-based methods by significantly reducing the memory footprint while retaining high rendering fidelity. The experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using wavelet transforms and trainable masking on 2D plane-based neural radiance fields to achieve a highly compact scene representation, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to other methods on novel view synthesis tasks under a tight memory budget of 2MB.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on masked wavelet representations for neural radiance fields compares to other research in compact neural scene representations:

- It builds on recent work using grid-based representations like Instant-NGP and TensoRF to accelerate neural radiance field training and inference. The key novelty is using wavelet transforms and trainable masking to further improve the compactness and efficiency of these representations. 

- Compared to other works like KiloNeRF and hash-based approaches, it does not partition the scene or use discretization. Instead, it keeps a continuous neural representation and focuses on sparsifying the grid coefficients. This retains the advantages of neural representations while reducing redundancy.

- Relative to frequency-based approaches like Fourier features or transformer networks, it specifically employs wavelets for their localization properties and demonstrates advantages over raw spatial and DCT features. The masking further increases sparsity over just wavelets alone.

- The proposed pipeline with run-length and entropy coding for compressing the sparse masks is tailored for neural scene data, as opposed to reliance on generic compression schemes. This maximizes compression performance.

- Results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression rates for neural radiance fields under a 2MB budget, while retaining rendering quality on par with or better than much larger uncompressed baseline models.

Overall, the work pushes the boundaries of compact neural scene representation by judiciously modifying and combining techniques from classical compression and recent neural representation literature. The experiments validate the approach and show promising avenues for even more efficient rendering of complex 3D scenes.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Expanding the grid-based neural field representation to larger, unbounded scenes. The current method works well for representing bounded 3D objects and scenes, but does not scale well to large, unbounded environments. The authors suggest extending the approach to handle these more challenging scenarios.

- Further improving the compression pipeline. The authors note there is still room to achieve even higher compression rates by using more advanced compression techniques on the sparse grid representations.

- Exploring other types of transformations beyond DWT for frequency-domain sparsity. DWT works well, but they suggest trying other transforms like DCT that may provide complementary benefits.

- Applying the masking and compression techniques to other forms of implicit neural representations beyond grid-based networks. The core ideas could potentially improve parameter efficiency in other coordinate-based networks.

- Leveraging perceptual metrics rather than PSNR for compression. Optimizing for perceptual quality over pixel-level metrics like PSNR could allow better trade-offs between rate and visual quality.

- Investigating the coefficient patterns and characteristics of different network architectures. The patterns in the learned grid masks provide hints about the nature of the trained representations. More analysis could further improve compression.

In summary, the main directions are 1) extending to larger scenes, 2) improving the compression pipeline, 3) exploring other transforms, 4) applying to other implicit networks, and 5) using perceptual metrics and analyzing coefficient patterns. Overall, there are many promising avenues for future work building on this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to reduce the size of grid-based neural radiance fields (NeRFs) using a wavelet transform and trainable masking. Typical NeRFs using multi-layer perceptrons have high computational costs. Grid-based NeRFs accelerate training and inference but require large memory storage. This paper compresses grid-based NeRFs by applying a discrete wavelet transform to the grid features and learning binary masks to zero out unnecessary coefficients. Experiments show the wavelet coefficients are more compact than spatial grid features. The proposed masking method removes over 95% of grid parameters without significantly degrading visual quality. By combining wavelet coefficients and masking, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis under a 2 MB memory budget. The wavelet transform captures both global and local information efficiently while the trainable masks identify unimportant regions to discard. This allows representing detailed 3D scenes with low memory requirements and fast rendering.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to compress neural radiance fields (NeRFs) using wavelet transforms and masking. NeRFs represent 3D scenes using neural networks, but can be computationally expensive. Recent methods accelerate NeRFs using grid-based representations, but these require substantial memory. This paper aims to reduce the memory footprint of grid-based NeRFs while maintaining quality. 

The key ideas are: 1) Apply a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on the 2D planes in a grid-based NeRF. This provides a compact frequency domain representation. 2) Introduce binary masks that are jointly optimized with the grid parameters. Masking allows over 95% of grid coefficients to be zeroed out without quality loss. 3) Apply compression techniques like run-length and Huffman encoding on the sparse masked wavelet coefficients. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance under a 2MB memory budget. The method has negligible overhead at test time. Overall, the wavelet representation and masking enable highly compressed yet accurate grid-based NeRFs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using a wavelet transform on grid-based neural radiance fields to improve parameter efficiency. Specifically, they decompose the 3D grids into 2D planes and apply a multi-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the grid parameters in each plane. This allows them to leverage the sparsity and compactness of wavelet representations to reduce the number of parameters needed to represent a scene. To further improve sparsity, they also propose learning binary masks for the wavelet coefficients through a trainable masking approach. The masks are optimized jointly with the grid parameters to zero out unnecessary coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality. After training, the wavelet grids are inverse transformed back to the spatial domain one time. This allows the model to have the same inference cost as regular spatial grid models while benefiting from the compact wavelet representation during training. Their experiments show this achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis under a 2MB memory budget by producing sparse yet high-quality grid-based neural radiance fields.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of high computational cost and large memory footprint of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically:

- NeRF uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent a 3D scene, which is computationally expensive during both training and inference. Training can take several days to converge.

- Recent methods that incorporate grid structures like Instant-NGP can accelerate training and inference but require large amounts of memory (over 1 GB) to store the dense 3D grids. 

- Other approaches like KiloNeRF can split the scene into partial networks to reduce computation but also require large storage.

- Methods using vector quantization like VQAD can reduce memory but need additional overhead during training.

The key question is how to reduce the computational and memory costs of neural radiance fields while maintaining high rendering quality.

To address this, the paper proposes using wavelet representations on grid-based neural fields. Wavelets can provide compact representations by capturing both local and global information. The paper also introduces a trainable masking technique to increase sparsity of the wavelet coefficients and further reduce memory requirements. By combining wavelets and masking, the method aims to attain state-of-the-art performance under a small memory budget while keeping inference efficient.

In summary, the key focus is developing an efficient and compact neural scene representation that retains the advantages of grid-based networks but reduces their computational and memory overhead. The proposed techniques of wavelet neural fields and learned masking help to achieve this goal.
