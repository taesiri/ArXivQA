# [Masked Wavelet Representation for Compact Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a more compact representation for neural radiance fields while maintaining high rendering quality. The key ideas proposed are:

- Using wavelet coefficients instead of raw spatial coefficients for grid-based neural radiance fields. This is hypothesized to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality compared to spatial representations.

- Introducing a trainable masking method to further increase sparsity of the wavelet coefficients by removing unnecessary coefficients. 

- Developing a compression pipeline to encode the sparse wavelet coefficients and masks into a compact representation.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that wavelet coefficients combined with trainable masking and compression techniques can lead to a significantly more compact neural radiance field representation without compromising rendering quality. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on various 3D scene datasets.
