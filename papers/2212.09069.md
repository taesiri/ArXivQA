# [Masked Wavelet Representation for Compact Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a more compact representation for neural radiance fields while maintaining high rendering quality. The key ideas proposed are:

- Using wavelet coefficients instead of raw spatial coefficients for grid-based neural radiance fields. This is hypothesized to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality compared to spatial representations.

- Introducing a trainable masking method to further increase sparsity of the wavelet coefficients by removing unnecessary coefficients. 

- Developing a compression pipeline to encode the sparse wavelet coefficients and masks into a compact representation.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that wavelet coefficients combined with trainable masking and compression techniques can lead to a significantly more compact neural radiance field representation without compromising rendering quality. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis on various 3D scene datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing the use of wavelet transforms on grid-based neural radiance fields to improve parameter sparsity and reconstruction quality. The authors show experimentally that wavelet coefficients can be more compact than spatial domain coefficients for representing neural radiance fields.

2. Introducing a novel trainable masking approach to achieve higher sparsity of grid coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality. The proposed masking method is able to zero out over 95% of grid parameters while causing only minor degradation in rendering quality.

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis under a tight memory budget of 2 MB. The combination of wavelet transforms and masking allows the method to represent scenes using very few parameters without compromising visual quality.

In summary, the key ideas are using wavelets and learned masks to enable highly compact representations of neural radiance fields. This improves on prior grid-based methods by significantly reducing the memory footprint while retaining high rendering fidelity. The experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.
