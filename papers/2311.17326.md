# [Mostly Beneficial Clustering: Aggregating Data for Operational Decision   Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17326)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel cluster-based data pooling approach that can exploit underlying cluster structures among multiple stochastic optimization problems to enhance data-driven decision making, especially when limited data is available for each individual problem. The method carefully pools data within identified clusters of similar problems to alleviate bias while reducing variance. Analytical results demonstrate clear benefits of clustering before pooling under mean squared error loss. With unknown cluster structures, clustering before pooling is still preferable when between-cluster distance is sufficiently large. Extensive experiments on newsvendor problems with synthetic and real-world data showcase substantial improvements from clustering, including automated determination of cluster numbers. By flexibly harnessing structures among problems and elegantly balancing bias-variance tradeoffs, the cluster-based approach advances the capability of data-driven decision making, particularly for large-scale systems with limited individual data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a cluster-based data pooling approach that leverages problem similarity structure to carefully aggregate limited data within clusters of problems to enhance data-driven decision-making, especially when solving a large number of problems with scarce data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel cluster-based data pooling approach that can exploit the cluster structure among problems when implementing data aggregation approaches for decision making. Specifically:

- When the cluster structure is known, the paper shows that the proposed cluster-based data pooling approach provides additional benefits over direct data pooling that neglects the cluster structure. 

- When the cluster structure is unknown, the paper proposes a data-driven procedure to estimate the cluster structure. It shows that unveiling the cluster structure can still be beneficial over direct data pooling, especially when the distance between clusters is substantial, even if it requires sacrificing a few data points for clustering. 

- The paper further extends the analysis to general cost functions and provides theoretical guarantees that the optimality gap of the proposed approach decreases exponentially as the number of problems grows large and the distance between clusters increases. 

- Finally, the paper validates the proposed approach with extensive numerical experiments using both synthetic data and real data from a European pharmacy chain. It highlights the advantages of cluster-based data pooling in the small-data large-scale regime.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a flexible cluster-based data pooling approach that can effectively leverage the similarity structure among problems to enhance decision making when facing many problems with limited data.
