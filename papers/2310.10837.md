# [Approximating Two-Layer Feedforward Networks for Efficient Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10837)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes new methods to improve Mixture of Experts (MoEs) for accelerating Transformer language models. The main research questions it addresses are:

1. How to construct lightweight yet powerful MoE layers that can replace dense feedforward layers in Transformers? 

2. Can MoEs be competitive with dense networks when using the same number of parameters? 

3. Are MoEs only useful for extremely large models or can they benefit smaller models as well?

4. What are better expert selection mechanisms and training techniques for MoEs?

The central hypothesis is that with proper design and training techniques, MoE layers can match or exceed the performance of dense feedforward layers in Transformers while using only a fraction of the compute, making MoEs a promising approach for efficient language modeling. 

The paper challenges common beliefs that MoEs are hard to train, not competitive parameter-wise with dense networks, and only useful for huge models. Through novel perspectives, analysis and proposed methods, it shows MoEs can overcome these limitations. Experiments demonstrate MoEs competitive with dense Transformer-XL on two datasets with moderate model sizes, not just gigantic models, confirming their potential as a generic acceleration technique.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a framework for unifying and improving methods for approximating two-layer feedforward networks in Transformers, such as product-key memories (PKMs) and mixture of experts (MoEs). The key contributions are:

- It provides a unified view of PKMs, MoEs, and other methods as approximating the key-value attention interpretation of feedforward layers. This view offers insights for improving these methods. 

- It proposes an improved MoE variant called σ-MoE, which uses a sigmoid gating function instead of softmax, a carefully designed initialization scheme, and simple but effective regularization through entropy maximization and expert dropout.

- It shows through experiments on several language modeling datasets that σ-MoE matches or exceeds the performance of dense Transformer baselines with the same parameter count, while using much less compute and memory. This demonstrates the potential of MoEs for efficient transformers across different scales.

- It releases an initial CUDA kernel implementation of MoE layers that already achieves speedups and memory savings compared to dense models.

Overall, the paper provides useful new perspectives on approximating feedforward layers in Transformers, demonstrates the viability of MoEs for efficient transformers at various scales, and offers simple but effective improvements over prior MoE designs. The code release also enables more accessible research on efficient transformers with limited hardware.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a unified framework for approximating two-layer neural networks like the feedforward blocks in Transformers, proposes improvements to methods like mixture of experts (MoEs) and product-key memories (PKMs) based on insights from this framework, and shows that the resulting MoE Transformer variant matches or outperforms dense Transformers on language modeling tasks while using much less compute and memory.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a unified perspective on approximating two-layer neural networks, focusing specifically on the feedforward blocks in Transformers. It makes several notable contributions:

- It provides a conceptual framework to view methods like Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), product-key memories (PKMs), and top-k sparsification as different approaches to approximating two-layer MLPs. This offers new insights into the design and training of these methods. 

- It proposes several improvements to MoEs, including using sigmoid over softmax for expert selection, a different initialization scheme, and simpler regularization via entropy maximization and expert dropout. This "sigma-MoE" outperforms prior MoE variants.

- It shows strong performance of MoEs in matching dense baseline Transformers across multiple datasets/scales, demonstrating their viability as a generic efficiency approach. Prior work focused more on large-scale settings.

- It highlights the importance of proper hyperparameter configuration and controlling sparsity levels for good MoE performance. This addresses common reservations about instability/difficulty of training MoEs.

- It provides an open-source CUDA kernel for MoE layers, enabling practical speedups and memory savings.

Overall, this paper significantly advances MoEs and the problem of efficient transformers. The unified view of approximation methods is novel, as are the proposed MoE improvements. Rigorous comparison to dense baselines and ablation studies are strengths.

Relative to other work:

- The unified approximation perspective distinguishes this from prior work focused just on MoEs or PKMs.

- The competitive results versus dense models advance the viability of MoEs beyond the large-scale regime.

- The insights on controlling sparsity help address difficulties in MoE training.

- The released kernel enables more practical usage. Other works like Switch Transformer focused on specialized hardware.

In summary, this paper makes important conceptual and practical contributions to research on efficient transformers and MoE methods. The unified view, proposed techniques, strong empirical results, and released code offer valuable advances to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different techniques for selecting experts in MoE layers, beyond the top-K approach used in this work. The authors suggest that more advanced routing methods could further improve the performance and efficiency of MoEs.

- Applying MoEs to other neural network architectures beyond Transformers, such as convolutions and recurrent networks. The authors argue that MoEs have the potential to accelerate many types of neural networks.

- Extending the application of MoEs beyond language modeling to other tasks like computer vision. The authors believe MoEs can have a broader impact beyond NLP.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why and how MoEs work, and when they can be expected to improve efficiency without much loss in performance. The authors note there is still limited formal analysis of MoEs.

- Applying MoEs to shared-layer architectures like Universal Transformers and Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NARs), which can particularly benefit from the parameter efficiency of MoEs.

- Further optimizing the CUDA kernels and GPU implementations of MoE layers to maximize their speedups on accelerator hardware. There is still room to engineer better MoE implementations.

- Exploring the compositionality and generalization abilities enabled by MoE architectures compared to dense networks. The mixture of experts may lend useful compositional properties.

So in summary, the authors lay out several interesting research directions to build on their work on efficient MoE layers for Transformers and take these methods to new models, tasks, and hardware platforms. Both theoretical and empirical work is needed to better understand and advance MoEs.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework that unifies various methods for approximating two-layer feedforward neural networks, such as the MLP blocks in Transformers. The core idea is to approximate the sum of all key-value pairs in the MLP computation by only keeping a subset of key-value pairs based on their contribution scores. This view encompasses techniques like product-key memories, sparse mixtures of experts (MoEs), and top-K sparsification. Leveraging insights from this perspective, the authors propose improvements to MoEs and product-key memories. Their resulting MoE Transformer outperforms prior MoE methods and matches the performance of dense Transformer baselines on language modeling tasks, while using much less compute and memory. 

The key contributions are: 1) A unified view of methods approximating two-layer MLPs based on keeping high-contribution key-value pairs. 2) Enhanced MoE training techniques, including a sigmoid gating function, specialized initialization, and simple entropy regularization with expert dropout. 3) Demonstrating strong results of their MoE Transformer relative to dense baselines on WikiText-103, Enwik8, C4, and peS2o datasets. The compute and memory savings enable training larger models on limited hardware. This shows MoEs are a promising technique not just for huge models but also for efficient models at any scale.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method in the paper is using Mixture of Experts (MoEs) to approximate two-layer feedforward neural networks, in order to reduce the compute and memory requirements of Transformer models for language modeling while maintaining performance. 

Specifically, the paper presents a unified framework for understanding methods like MoEs, product-key memories, and top-k sparsification as ways to approximate two-layer feedforward blocks in Transformers. Within this framework, the authors propose improvements to MoEs, including using a sigmoid activation function for expert selection, a specialized initialization scheme, and a simple entropy regularization method to prevent expert collapse. 

The resulting MoE Transformer model matches or exceeds the performance of dense Transformer baselines on language modeling benchmarks like WikiText-103 and Enwik8, while using much fewer computational resources. For example, the MoE Transformer achieves a 25-50% reduction in FLOPs compared to an equally parameterized dense model. The authors also develop a CUDA kernel to further accelerate MoE layers in practice.

Overall, the key methodological contribution is a principled approximate computing perspective on MoEs, which enables design improvements leading to state-of-the-art efficient Transformers for language modeling. The proposed MoEs can accelerate models at any scale, not just extremely large ones.
