# [TriVol: Point Cloud Rendering via Triple Volumes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16485)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to generate photo-realistic and view-consistent images from point cloud inputs. The key hypothesis is that a novel 3D representation called TriVol, composed of three slim feature volumes, can be used with NeRF rendering to effectively solve the point cloud rendering task.

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. The proposed TriVol representation can capture both local and non-local features from the point cloud in an efficient way, enabling high-resolution 3D feature volumes to be generated. 

2. The feature volumes in TriVol are continuous and discriminative, allowing accurate and consistent feature querying via trilinear interpolation.

3. By combining TriVol with NeRF volume rendering, the model can generate high-quality rendered images from point clouds that are free of hole artifacts and inconsistent views.

4. The category-specific TriVol representation enables rendering novel scenes/objects of the same category without fine-tuning.

The key innovation is the TriVol 3D representation and how it is integrated into a NeRF-based renderer. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in generating photo-realistic point cloud renderings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel 3D representation called TriVol for point cloud rendering. The key points are:

- TriVol consists of three slim volumes encoded from the input point cloud. Compared to dense voxels, TriVol is more lightweight and allows for higher resolution 3D representation. 

- An effective encoder-decoder framework is proposed to transform the point cloud to dense and continuous Feature TriVol, which enables accurate feature querying via trilinear interpolation.

- By combining TriVol with NeRF for volume rendering, the method can generate photo-realistic and view-consistent results from point clouds.

- Experiments on scene- and object-level datasets demonstrate the advantages of TriVol over other representations and point cloud rendering methods. The framework also shows excellent generalization ability without fine-tuning on unseen data.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the TriVol representation that enables efficient yet accurate point cloud rendering, with both quantitative and qualitative improvements over prior arts. The effectiveness is validated on various benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in this paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D representation called TriVol, composed of three slim feature volumes efficiently transformed from a point cloud, that can be combined with NeRF to achieve photo-realistic and view-consistent rendering through discriminative feature extraction and trilinear feature querying.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on point cloud rendering via triple volumes (TriVol) compares to other research in the same field:

- Representation: The TriVol representation proposed in this paper is a novel and efficient 3D representation compared to other representations like dense/sparse voxels, multiplane images, and NeRF. It uses three slim feature volumes that capture both local and non-local features at different scales. This allows high resolution modeling while being lightweight.

- Encoder: The grouping-based encoder to transform the point cloud into initial TriVol volumes is simple yet effective compared to using more complex point cloud networks like PointNet/PointNet++.

- Decoder: Using independent 3D UNet modules on each volume for dense feature decoding is more efficient than a single 3D UNet on the full voxel grid. This allows higher resolution volumes.

- Rendering: Combining the discriminative TriVol representation with NeRF volume rendering achieves higher quality view consistent photo-realistic rendering than other point based (NPBG, Point-NeRF) or voxel based methods (ME, NPCR).

- Generalization: The continuous TriVol features allow remarkable generalization to novel scenes/objects without fine-tuning compared to other methods.

Overall, the TriVol framework provides an advance in point cloud rendering by designing a lightweight yet efficient 3D representation that combines the strengths of volumes and point networks for high quality generalized rendering. The experiments validate its advantages over existing state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.
