# [TriVol: Point Cloud Rendering via Triple Volumes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16485)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to generate photo-realistic and view-consistent images from point cloud inputs. The key hypothesis is that a novel 3D representation called TriVol, composed of three slim feature volumes, can be used with NeRF rendering to effectively solve the point cloud rendering task.

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. The proposed TriVol representation can capture both local and non-local features from the point cloud in an efficient way, enabling high-resolution 3D feature volumes to be generated. 

2. The feature volumes in TriVol are continuous and discriminative, allowing accurate and consistent feature querying via trilinear interpolation.

3. By combining TriVol with NeRF volume rendering, the model can generate high-quality rendered images from point clouds that are free of hole artifacts and inconsistent views.

4. The category-specific TriVol representation enables rendering novel scenes/objects of the same category without fine-tuning.

The key innovation is the TriVol 3D representation and how it is integrated into a NeRF-based renderer. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in generating photo-realistic point cloud renderings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on point cloud rendering via triple volumes (TriVol) compares to other research in the same field:

- Representation: The TriVol representation proposed in this paper is a novel and efficient 3D representation compared to other representations like dense/sparse voxels, multiplane images, and NeRF. It uses three slim feature volumes that capture both local and non-local features at different scales. This allows high resolution modeling while being lightweight.

- Encoder: The grouping-based encoder to transform the point cloud into initial TriVol volumes is simple yet effective compared to using more complex point cloud networks like PointNet/PointNet++.

- Decoder: Using independent 3D UNet modules on each volume for dense feature decoding is more efficient than a single 3D UNet on the full voxel grid. This allows higher resolution volumes.

- Rendering: Combining the discriminative TriVol representation with NeRF volume rendering achieves higher quality view consistent photo-realistic rendering than other point based (NPBG, Point-NeRF) or voxel based methods (ME, NPCR).

- Generalization: The continuous TriVol features allow remarkable generalization to novel scenes/objects without fine-tuning compared to other methods.

Overall, the TriVol framework provides an advance in point cloud rendering by designing a lightweight yet efficient 3D representation that combines the strengths of volumes and point networks for high quality generalized rendering. The experiments validate its advantages over existing state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method to render scenes with extremely large missing areas. The authors note it is challenging for their method to render scenes where a very large number of points are missing. They suggest using a pretrained 3D generator model trained on large datasets to synthesize missing points as a potential solution. 

- Applying the TriVol representation to other 3D tasks beyond rendering, such as 3D object detection, segmentation, and reconstruction. The authors propose TriVol as a new 3D representation that is lightweight yet can represent high-resolution volumes. Exploring its usefulness for other 3D tasks could be promising future work.

- Investigating other encoders beyond the simple axis grouping for generating the Initial TriVol. The authors use a basic grouping mechanism but note more advanced point cloud encoders like PointNet or PointNet++ could be explored. Finding optimal encoders tailored for the TriVol could further improve results.

- Extending the method to video rendering from dynamic point clouds. The current method focuses on rendering individual frames. Rendering coherent video by integrating temporal information from dynamic point clouds is an important direction.

- Exploring self-supervised training rather than just supervised training. The current model relies on ground truth images for supervision. Investigating how to train it in a self-supervised manner, e.g. using view synthesis as self-supervision, could improve generalization.

In summary, the main future directions are around extending TriVol to new tasks and data modalities, exploring improved encoders and training schemes, and handling very large missing areas in point clouds. Advancing the method in these directions could further increase its practical usefulness.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes TriVol, a novel 3D representation for point cloud rendering. TriVol consists of three slim volumes encoded from the input point cloud. Compared to dense voxel grids, TriVol is more lightweight and memory-efficient, allowing higher resolution 3D representations. The volumes in TriVol extract both local and non-local features along different axes for a discriminative representation. An efficient encoder-decoder framework is used to transform the point cloud to TriVol. The encoder groups voxels along each axis into slim volumes using a simple but effective strategy without needing complex neural networks. The decoder uses three independent 3D convolutional networks to decode each volume into a dense feature representation. The features of any 3D point can then be queried using trilinear interpolation in the TriVol volumes. By combining the queried features with NeRF volume rendering, the method can generate photo-realistic point cloud renderings.

Experiments were conducted on scene-level (ScanNet) and object-level (ShapeNet, Google Scanned Objects) datasets.

Overall, the paper introduces an effective and lightweight 3D representation for point cloud rendering. The TriVol framework achieves higher quality renderings compared to prior graphics- and learning-based approaches. Key advantages are the efficiency of representation, discriminative feature learning, and strong generalization ability.
