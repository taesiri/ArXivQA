# [Automatically Evolving CNN Architectures Based on Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11875)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to automatically design/evolve CNN architectures using genetic algorithms, in a way that is completely automatic (requires no human expertise), efficient (uses limited computational resources), and achieves high performance on image classification tasks. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new genetic algorithm called AE-CNN that addresses limitations of prior work in automatically evolving CNN architectures. The goal is to develop an algorithm that:

- Requires no pre-processing, base CNNs, or post-processing by human experts (completely automatic)

- Uses an efficient encoding strategy and operates on limited computational resources

- Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy on image classification benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

The core hypothesis is that by using a variable-length encoding strategy built on ResNet/DenseNet blocks, along with carefully designed crossover and mutation operators, the AE-CNN algorithm can effectively evolve CNN architectures automatically that perform very well on image classification tasks, using limited computational resources.

The paper presents the AE-CNN algorithm and evaluates it experimentally against state-of-the-art hand-designed CNNs as well as other automated CNN architecture search methods. The goal is to demonstrate AE-CNN's abilities to efficiently evolve high-performing CNN architectures in a completely automatic way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an automatic method for evolving CNN architectures using a genetic algorithm. Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

- It proposes a novel encoding strategy to represent CNN architectures based on ResNet and DenseNet blocks, allowing the evolution of CNNs with varying depth. 

- It presents a new crossover operator to handle variable-length representations and enable effective recombination of CNN architectures.

- It designs mutation operators tailored for the proposed encoding to explore the search space.

- It develops a genetic algorithm that leverages the encoding, crossover, and mutation to automatically search for high-performance CNN architectures without any human expertise or manual architecture engineering. 

- It demonstrates that the proposed approach can find CNN architectures that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR image classification benchmarks, outperforming many hand-designed and automatically-designed peer networks.

In summary, the key innovation is the development of an end-to-end framework based on genetic algorithms to automatically design competitive CNN architectures for a given task in a completely unsupervised manner, without any human intervention during the architecture search process. This eliminates the need for expert knowledge in CNN architecture engineering and makes CNN design accessible to non-experts.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in the field of automatically designing CNN architectures:

- This paper proposes a new genetic algorithm-based method called AE-CNN for automatic CNN architecture design. It builds on prior work using evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning for this task.

- The key novelty of AE-CNN is its use of variable-length encoding to allow evolving different CNN depths, along with new crossover and mutation operators suited for this representation. This provides more flexibility compared to fixed-length encodings in some prior genetic CNN work.

- AE-CNN does not require any human expertise or hand-designed base networks. This makes it more fully automated than semi-automated methods like EAS and Block-QNN-S which depend on human-crafted base networks.

- In experiments, AE-CNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to prior automated methods on CIFAR-10/100, with 4.7% and 22.4% test error. It also uses far fewer GPU-days than methods like Large-scale Evolution and NAS.

- The accuracy of AE-CNN is competitive with semi-automated methods like Hierarchical Evolution and Block-QNN-S, while using less computation than them. It also outperforms fully manual network design.

- One limitation is AE-CNN still requires more GPU computation than some methods like EAS. But this is expected as EAS leverages human expertise. The fully automated nature of AE-CNN is a key advantage.

In summary, this paper pushes forward automatic CNN architecture search by introducing a more flexible evolutionary approach. AE-CNN advances the state-of-the-art in accuracy and efficiency for fully automated methods, demonstrating competitive performance to semi-automated techniques as well. It represents an important step towards eliminating the need for human expertise in CNN design.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating other types of blocks as the building components besides ResNet blocks and DenseNet blocks. The authors mention this could lead to even better performance.

- Incorporating other techniques like dropout or batch normalization into the evolved architectures. The authors didn't use these in this work to keep things simple, but suggest exploring them in future work.

- Speeding up the fitness evaluation, which is the most computationally expensive part. The authors suggest this could help scale the approach to larger datasets and models.

- Exploring different crossover and mutation operators tailored for the variable-length encoding scheme. The authors used simple operators in this work, but more sophisticated ones could improve the search. 

- Applying the approach to other tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The general framework should be adaptable to other CNN architecture search problems.

- Investigating other search algorithms besides genetic algorithms, like reinforcement learning, to automatically design architectures. Comparing different search methods would be interesting.

- Adding the ability to automatically search for optimal hyperparameter values during architecture evolution. Currently things like learning rate are set manually.

So in summary, the main future directions are around expanding the building blocks, incorporating more techniques, speeding up evaluation, trying other search algorithms, and applying the method to other tasks and architectures beyond simple image classification CNNs.
