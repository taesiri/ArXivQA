# [Contextual-based Image Inpainting: Infer, Match, and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08590)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we develop an effective learning-based approach to generate visually coherent and high-quality image inpainting for high-resolution images?

Specifically, the authors aim to develop an image inpainting method that can:

1) Synthesize missing parts of a high-resolution image with realistic and sharp textures. 

2) Generate contents that are semantically meaningful and visually consistent with the surrounding known regions.

3) Produce results comparable or superior to previous state-of-the-art methods.

4) Scale to handle large images beyond 256x256 resolution, which prior works struggled with. 

5) Have fast runtime that is practical for real applications, compared to slow optimization-based approaches.

To achieve this, the key ideas explored are: 

- Breaking down the problem into separate inference and translation steps, each handled by a dedicated neural network.

- Using a patch-swap technique to propagate texture details from known to missing regions. 

- Multi-scale training and inference to handle high resolutions.

- A robust training scheme to avoid underfitting when manipulating features.

The central hypothesis is that by dividing the task and using simple heuristics like patch-swap, the problem becomes tractable as two easier sub-problems of learning image-feature translations. The experiments aim to validate if the proposed techniques can achieve state-of-the-art inpainting quality and generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(1) The authors propose a learning-based image inpainting system that can synthesize missing parts in high-resolution images with realistic and sharp textures. 

(2) They introduce a novel training scheme that divides the problem into separate stages of inference, matching, and translation, with each stage modeled by a neural network. This reduces the complexity of learning the full mapping.

(3) They design a "patch-swap" technique to propagate high-frequency textures from the known regions to fill in the missing areas. This provides the neural network with sufficient details to enable reconstruction.

(4) They demonstrate that their approach achieves results comparable or superior to previous state-of-the-art methods like context encoders and global & local inpainting, especially for larger images and holes. 

(5) Their trained model generalizes well to other tasks like style transfer by learning a robust mapping from features to images.

In summary, the key innovation is in simplifying the problem and incorporating heuristic guidance like patch-swap to make the learning process more effective. This enables high-quality inpainting on larger and more complex inputs compared to prior deep learning techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a learning-based approach for image inpainting that divides the task into inference and translation stages using neural networks, with a patch propagation method to transfer texture details from known to missing regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:

- It takes a learning-based approach using deep neural networks, whereas a lot of prior work relied on optimization or non-neural techniques. This allows it to leverage the representation power of deep learning.

- The paper introduces a multi-stage training pipeline, first generating a coarse image and then refining it. This makes the problem more tractable compared to end-to-end approaches.

- It uses a patch-swap technique to propagate high-frequency texture details from the known region to the hole. This injects useful prior knowledge into the model. 

- The method scales to higher resolutions like 512x512, while many prior learning-based methods were limited to smaller images.

- It achieves state-of-the-art visual quality at the time, especially for large holes, compared to optimization-based and other learning techniques.

- The approach is significantly faster than optimization-based techniques like neural patch synthesis.

- The paper shows the model can generalize to other tasks like style transfer, demonstrating flexibility.

Overall, the key innovations are in using a multi-stage trained pipeline with patch propagation to achieve high-quality inpainting results efficiently for larger images than prior learning-based methods. The results demonstrate both visual quality and flexibility improvements over existing research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different network architectures and training techniques to further improve the inference and final inpainting results. The authors note their approach is a meta-algorithm that could benefit from innovations in network design and training methodology.

- Applying the multi-stage, multi-scale training paradigm to directly synthesize high-resolution images from random sampling. The authors suggest their techniques could be generalized beyond inpainting.

- Leveraging more sophisticated learning-based methods for the initial coarse inference step, instead of the FCN-based Image2Feature network. 

- Investigating iterative inference by repeatedly applying the Feature2Image network and patch-swap operation. The authors found this improved sharpness but introduced artifacts.

- Applying the approach to video inpainting, since it has fast runtime. Video presents additional challenges like temporal consistency.

- Enhancing the training data and augmentation to handle complex textures and patterns. The authors show failure cases on such inputs.

- Modifying the loss functions and training process to reduce artifacts and noise in the synthesized contents.

- Exploring the use of the trained Feature2Image network for other vision tasks, as it learns a general mapping from features to images.

In summary, the main directions are around refinements to the training and architecture, generalizing the approach to other generation tasks, and applying it to video inpainting. The authors propose their method as a general framework that could benefit from future innovations in deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a learning-based approach for image inpainting, which aims to fill missing regions in an image with plausible content. The key idea is to break down the inpainting task into two stages - inference and translation. In the inference stage, an Image2Feature network fills in a coarse prediction for the missing region. In the translation stage, a Feature2Image network refines this coarse prediction into a complete, realistic image. To guide the training, a patch-swap technique is used to propagate texture details from the known region to the filled region. By dividing the task and leveraging patch-swap, the problem is simplified into learning two image-feature translation functions which are easier to optimize. Experiments show the method generates sharper and higher quality inpainting results compared to previous approaches, especially for large missing regions, and can scale to high resolutions like 512x512. The model is fast at test time and can generalize to other tasks like style transfer.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a learning-based approach for image inpainting, which is the task of filling in missing or damaged regions of an image with plausible content. The key idea is to break down the difficult problem of directly mapping an incomplete image to a completed one into two easier sub-problems - coarse inference followed by refinement. 

First, an Image2Feature network is trained to fill in the missing region with a coarse prediction, which captures the overall structure but lacks details. The features of this prediction are extracted. Next, a patch-swap operation is used to propagate texture details from known regions to the hole using neural patch similarity. Finally, a Feature2Image network is trained to transform these "swapped" features back to a sharp, realistic image. This divides the complex distribution learning into smaller translation tasks in feature space. Multi-scale training and inference are used to handle high resolutions. Experiments show the method generates better visual results than previous approaches on image datasets, and also generalizes to style transfer by reconstructing swapped feature maps.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a learning-based approach for image inpainting, which involves filling in missing regions of an image with plausible content. The method divides the task into two main steps - inference and translation. An Image2Feature network first makes a coarse prediction to fill in the missing region. Then a patch-swap operation propagates texture details from the known region to the predicted region. Finally, a Feature2Image network translates the manipulated feature map to a complete, high-resolution image. By breaking the problem down into smaller steps with networks trained on clean data, the method makes high-resolution inpainting tractable. The patch-swap acts as a simple prior to guide texture transfer. Experiments show the approach can synthesize sharper results than previous methods and scale to larger images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper is addressing the problem of generating high-quality and coherent image inpainting (filling in missing or damaged parts of an image) for high-resolution images. 

Some key points:

- Generating realistic high-resolution images is difficult for deep generative models due to the high dimensionality of pixels.

- Image inpainting is a useful but constrained task compared to general image generation, since part of the image is known. 

- Existing deep learning methods for inpainting like context encoders struggle with high-resolution images and tend to produce blurry or artifact-ridden results.

- Optimization-based inpainting methods can work for high-res images but are slow. 

- The authors propose a learning-based approach to inpaint high-res images in a fast feed-forward pass by breaking down the problem into two stages - coarse inference of structure and textures, and then refinement/translation of textures.

So in summary, it aims to address the problem of generating high-quality coherent inpainting for high-resolution images in an efficient learning-based framework, overcoming limitations of prior deep generative and optimization-based methods.
