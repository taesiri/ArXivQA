# [Zero shot VLMs for hate meme detection: Are we there yet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Hateful memes are spreading rapidly on social media, exploiting humor to target vulnerable groups. Manual content moderation is impossible at scale, and traditional ML models require large labeled datasets which are scarce.  
- There is a research gap in understanding the effectiveness of recent zero-shot capable Visual Language Models (VLMs) for hateful meme detection, especially across different prompt settings.

Objectives and Methodology
- Assess VLMs - IDEFICS, LLaVA, InstructBLIP - for zero-shot hate meme detection using 4 datasets - FHM, MAMI, HARM-P, HARM-C.
- Test 6 model setups with 8 prompt variations covering aspects like input patterns (vanilla, definition, OCR, OCR+definition) and output patterns (label only or label + explanation). 
- Analyze misclassifications by clustering image embeddings and using multi-modal topic modeling to induce a typology of failure cases.

Key Findings
- Performance varies based on datasets, prompts and model setups indicating inconsistent behavior.
- OCR or OCR+definition inputs work better than vanilla inputs. Explanation outputs do not help much.  
- IDEFICS (9B, 8-bit) and LLaVA (13B, 16-bit) emerge as better model setups.
- Models get confused with multi-panel memes and are biased by presence of certain topics like Trump.

Main Contributions
- First comprehensive assessment of multiple VLMs on hate meme detection covering various prompts.
- Detailed analysis to reveal strengths and vulnerabilities of VLMs. 
- Proposal of a wide prompt design space.
- Induced typology of failure cases to inform future VLM guardrail design.

In summary, the paper establishes that VLMs still demonstrate inconsistent behavior for zero-shot hate meme detection, especially when subjected to a diverse prompt design space. The insights on failure cases can guide building robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the effectiveness of zero-shot large visual language models on hate meme detection across multiple datasets and prompt strategies, finding that they are still quite vulnerable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a wide array of prompt variations that the authors use to query visual language models (VLMs) to understand their strengths and vulnerabilities in hate meme detection. Specifically, they investigate 48 different prompts (8 prompt variations across 6 model setups) for each of 4 datasets related to hateful, misogynistic, and harmful memes. The prompts vary along two main dimensions:

1) Input patterns: 
(a) vanilla input 
(b) input + definition of hateful/harmful
(c) input + OCR text  
(d) input + definition + OCR text

2) Output patterns:  
(a) vanilla output (just classification label)
(b) output + explanation 

Through analysis of the results across datasets, models, and prompts, the authors conclusively establish that VLMs are still quite vulnerable in zero-shot hateful meme classification even across multiple prompting variants. The paper proposes a typology of failure cases that can help guide future efforts to enhance VLM robustness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this research include:

- Hateful memes - The main object of study in the paper, referring to memes that spread hate or target certain communities.

- Zero-shot classification - A key goal of the paper is assessing how well VLMs can detect hateful memes without any dataset-specific fine-tuning, i.e. in a zero-shot setting. 

- Visual language models (VLMs) - The models tested in the research, including IDEFICS, LLaVA, and InstructBLIP. Their zero-shot hate meme detection capabilities are analyzed.

- Prompt engineering - A major contribution of the paper is testing a wide array of prompt variations (8 per model setup) to query the VLMs, categorized into input patterns and output patterns.

- Misclassification analysis - The authors cluster misclassified hateful/not hateful memes using embeddings and topic modeling to induce a "typology" of cases where models fail.

- Social media moderation - The real-world motivation for hateful meme detection, as these memes spread hate speech or misinformation on platforms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores zero-shot classification performance of VLMs on hate meme detection. What are some key challenges in creating labeled datasets for training supervised hate meme detection models that motivate the exploration of zero-shot capabilities?

2. The paper studies performance over 8 different prompt variations. What are the different categories of prompts explored in terms of input and output patterns? What is the intuition behind trying these different prompt variations?

3. The best prompt strategies vary across models and datasets. What inferences can be made about the models' capabilities based on which type of prompts work better for them? For example, does the need for additional context in the prompts indicate any weakness of the models?

4. The paper identifies the best performing (model, prompt) combination for each dataset. What is the spread across models and prompts in terms of which ones perform the best? Does any particular model or prompt stand out in terms of consistency?

5. For the best (model, prompt, dataset) combinations, what trends do you observe in terms of misclassifications from negative to positive v/s positive to negative? What could explain such trends?

6. How are the misclassified memes clustered to identify a typology of failure cases? What is the intuition behind using multi-modal topic modeling on these clusters?

7. Analyze the typology of failure cases - are there any consistent themes about contexts where models fail across datasets? Are there any interesting differences?

8. The paper finds VLMs still vulnerable in zero-shot hate meme detection. What could be potential ways to make them more robust? For example, targeted finetuning, better prompt design, etc.

9. The paper limits analysis to English memes. How do you think performance would vary for non-English memes? What additional complexities need to be handled?  

10. What are some potential negative societal implications if such models are actually deployed for automatic moderation? How can we safeguard against such risks?
