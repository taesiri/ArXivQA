# [Continual learning for surface defect segmentation by subnetwork   creation and selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05100)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new continual learning algorithm called LDA-CP&S for surface defect segmentation that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. The method creates defect-specific subnetworks within a U-Net architecture using iterative pruning. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then trained on convolutional features to predict the defect type at inference, choosing the right subnetwork for segmentation. Experiments on two defect datasets demonstrate LDA-CP&S achieves a mean Intersection over Union score more than twice as high as other continual learning techniques and is comparable to joint training. A key advantage is only requiring the current task's data, without storing previous data. Overall, LDA-CP&S advances continual learning for the important manufacturing application of surface defect segmentation by accumulating knowledge over time without forgetting previously seen defects.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new continual learning algorithm called LDA-CP&S that performs incremental surface defect segmentation without catastrophic forgetting by creating defect-specific subnetworks and using linear discriminant analysis for subnetwork selection during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new continual learning algorithm called LDA-CP&S for surface defect segmentation that is able to learn new types of defects incrementally without forgetting previous ones. Specifically:

- The method creates defect-specific subnetworks via iterative pruning for each new defect type encountered. This avoids catastrophic forgetting issues faced by conventional fine-tuning approaches.

- A classifier based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is trained to predict the defect type. At inference, this classifier selects the appropriate subnetwork for defect segmentation. 

- Experiments on two defect segmentation datasets show that LDA-CP&S achieves significantly higher performance (over 2x higher mean IoU) compared to other continual learning methods and is comparable to joint training where all data is available at once.

- The approach does not require storing data from previous tasks, making it suitable for scenarios where old data may not be accessible.

In summary, the key contribution is a new continual learning technique for the important practical problem of surface defect segmentation that outperforms existing methods while not needing previous data storage.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained incrementally on different tasks. This limits their ability to continually learn new defect types in surface defect segmentation without forgetting previous ones.

- Existing approaches either rely on storing data from past tasks or have unsatisfactory performance in preventing forgetting. There is a need for a continual learning approach for surface defect segmentation that does not store old data and effectively mitigates forgetting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new continual learning algorithm called LDA-CP&S that creates task-specific subnetworks for each new defect type using iterative pruning. 

- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is trained on features from a CNN to predict the defect type. The corresponding pruned subnetwork is then used for segmentation.

- This allows learning new tasks without forgetting old ones by having fixed task-specific parameters for each defect type. LDA also eliminates need for batch-based subnetwork selection.

Main Contributions:

- First work to develop a continual learning approach for surface defect segmentation that mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

- LDA-CP&S creates defect-specific subnetworks leading to over 2x higher mean IoU compared to existing methods. Performance is comparable to joint training.

- LDA as a defect type classifier eliminates need for batch-based subnetwork selection, enabling inference on single samples.

- Analysis of impact of pruning hyperparameters on continual learning capability and final performance.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in effectively applying continual learning to the surface defect segmentation problem using an elegant approach of combining iterative pruning and LDA-based task identification.
