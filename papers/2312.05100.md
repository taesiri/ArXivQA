# [Continual learning for surface defect segmentation by subnetwork   creation and selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05100)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new continual learning algorithm called LDA-CP&S for surface defect segmentation that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. The method creates defect-specific subnetworks within a U-Net architecture using iterative pruning. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then trained on convolutional features to predict the defect type at inference, choosing the right subnetwork for segmentation. Experiments on two defect datasets demonstrate LDA-CP&S achieves a mean Intersection over Union score more than twice as high as other continual learning techniques and is comparable to joint training. A key advantage is only requiring the current task's data, without storing previous data. Overall, LDA-CP&S advances continual learning for the important manufacturing application of surface defect segmentation by accumulating knowledge over time without forgetting previously seen defects.
