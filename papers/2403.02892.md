# [Enhancing Long-Term Person Re-Identification Using Global, Local Body   Part, and Head Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of long-term person re-identification. Typical person re-identification methods assume that people do not change their clothes, limiting their application to short-term scenarios. Long-term person re-identification considers both clothes-changing and clothes-consistent scenarios, allowing the retrieval of images of the same person wearing different clothes over an extended period of time. This problem is challenging since the visual appearance of a person can change significantly when they change clothes.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called Parts-Aligned and Head Network (PAH-Net) that effectively utilizes both global and local information to enable long-term person re-identification. The framework consists of three streams - global stream, local body part stream and head stream. 

The global stream extracts identity-relevant features from the entire image. It encodes the most distinct, less distinct and average features using adversarial erasing, max pooling and average pooling.

The local body part stream aligns features between body parts to compare the same body part across images. It uses clustering to generate pseudo-labels for body parts since part annotations are unavailable. These pseudo-labels are used to train an implicit body part segmentation head.  

The head stream explicitly detects and crops the head region to extract identity-features specifically from the head. Like the global stream, it also encodes the most distinct, less distinct and average head features.

The framework is trained using identity classification loss, pair-based loss and pseudo body part segmentation loss. During inference, features from the three streams are concatenated for person re-identification.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel framework for long-term person re-identification that effectively utilizes global, local body part and head information
- Introduces local body part stream based on clustering-generated pseudo-labels for body parts to enable part-aligned feature comparison
- Employs explicit head stream along with global stream to focus on head region
- Encodes most distinct, less distinct and average features in global and head streams using adversarial erasing, max and average pooling 
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three datasets for long-term person re-identification
