# [Meaningful Learning: Advancing Abstract Reasoning in Large Language   Models via Generic Fact Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates the abstract reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Abstract reasoning involves applying general principles or patterns across different situations. 
- Experiments reveal a large gap between LLMs' general reasoning performance and their abstract reasoning abilities, indicating they lack the capability to leverage generic facts flexibly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper creates a new abstract reasoning dataset (AbsR) containing generic facts and explanations showing how to apply them. 
- A new "meaningful learning" training paradigm is introduced to teach LLMs to utilize generic facts implicitly like humans do. This enhances both their knowledge and reasoning skills.

Key Contributions:
- Provides systematic analysis of deficiencies in LLMs' abstract reasoning capacities using new evaluation metrics.
- Introduces AbsR dataset with generic fact explanations to promote abstract reasoning.
- Meaningful learning paradigm significantly improves LLMs' general and abstract reasoning over a range of benchmarks.
- Demonstrates methods to impart stronger high-level reasoning skills in LLMs beyond basic memorization.

In summary, the paper conducts an insightful investigation into abstract reasoning abilities of LLMs, reveals limitations in current models, and makes important strides towards overcoming this by implicitly infusing knowledge and reasoning skills through the tailored AbsR dataset and meaningful learning approach.
