# [Learning a Deep Color Difference Metric for Photographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14964)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a deep learning-based color difference (CD) metric for photographic images that is perceptually accurate, mathematically proper as a metric, consistent with human color perception mechanisms, and robust to mild geometric distortions?

The key hypothesis is that a multi-scale autoregressive normalizing flow model can satisfy all these desired properties for a CD metric. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called CD-Flow that uses a multi-scale normalizing flow to learn an invertible feature transform, followed by Euclidean distance computation, to assess color differences between photographic images. The goal is to develop a CD metric that aligns with human perceptual judgments, works well on natural images beyond just color patches, and is robust to image misalignments.

The main hypotheses are:

- Using a normalizing flow to learn an invertible feature transform will result in a proper mathematical metric for CD. 

- A multi-scale architecture can model interdependency of color and form like human perception.

- Autoregressive conditioning provides robustness to geometric distortions.

The experiments aim to validate whether CD-Flow satisfies these desired criteria compared to prior CD metrics. The results show CD-Flow outperforms other methods on a photographic image dataset while remaining robust to distortions.

In summary, the main research goal is developing an improved learning-based CD metric with several ideal properties, which is achieved via the proposed CD-Flow model according to the paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a deep learning-based color difference (CD) metric called CD-Flow for assessing perceptual color differences between photographic images. The key highlights are:

- CD-Flow is designed based on the scientific findings that color and form processing are interdependent in human visual system. It uses a multi-scale autoregressive normalizing flow to learn an invertible feature transform that interacts color and form information across multiple scales.

- CD-Flow satisfies four desirable properties: 1) consistent with human color perception mechanism, 2) a proper mathematical metric, 3) accurate in explaining subjective perceptual CDs, 4) robust to mild geometric distortions.

- Experiments on the SPCD dataset show CD-Flow outperforms 15 existing CD metrics in predicting human perceptual CDs for natural images. It also produces interpretable multi-scale local CD maps.

- Ablation studies verify the benefits of the multi-scale autoregressive design of the normalizing flow. The learned representation is also empirically shown to be perceptually uniform.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a principled deep learning framework CD-Flow for perceptual CD assessment of photographic images, which well aligns with human color perception while enjoying nice mathematical properties.
