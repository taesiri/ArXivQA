# [Enhanced fringe-to-phase framework using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- In Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP), using a limited number of fringe images complicates phase recovery and unwrapping, making high-quality 3D reconstruction challenging. 
- Existing methods require multiple fringe images, slowing down measurement speed which limits real-time application.
- Existing FPP datasets are limited in quantity and diversity of objects captured.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Symmetric Fusion Network (SFNet) that transforms two fringe images into an absolute phase for high-speed, high-quality 3D reconstruction.
- Network has two encoders to extract features from fringe images, fused via concatenation layer. Two decoders then predict wrapped phases.
- Use a refined reference phase during training that incorporates fringe images of different frequencies than input images. This enhances output reliability.
- Introduce various loss functions - phase loss, phase consistency loss, geometric constraint loss.

Contributions:
- SFNet achieves high accuracy 3D reconstruction from just two fringe images, outperforming other fringe-to-phase methods.
- Present large-scale SynthFringe dataset with 18,000 scenes captured in a virtual FPP system, containing diverse frequencies.
- Validation via comparative experiments, ablation studies demonstrating effectiveness of proposed framework and components.

In summary, this paper proposes a deep learning framework and dataset to achieve reliable high-quality 3D reconstruction from limited fringe images for FPP systems. The solution is validated extensively and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.
