# [CMA-R:Causal Mediation Analysis for Explaining Rumour Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for explaining neural models for rumour detection mostly rely on attention weights, but attention does not properly capture the causal relations in the decision-making process. There is a need for methods that can identify the tweets and words that causally contribute to a model's veracity predictions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel method called CMA-R (Causal Mediation Analysis for Rumour detection) that is grounded in causal mediation analysis. CMA-R performs interventions at the input level (masking out tweets) to measure the total causal effect of tweets. It also performs interventions at the neuron level (replacing neuron activations) to measure the indirect causal effects of words. This allows CMA-R to identify tweets and words that are causally implicated in the model's predictions.

Experiments:
The authors train neural rumour detection models of differing complexities and compare CMA-R against attention and other interpretation methods on a journalist-annotated rumour dataset that has ground truth turnaround tweets.

Main Contributions:
- CMA-R is the first work to apply causal mediation analysis to open up the blackbox of neural rumour detection models by performing input and neuron interventions.
- Empirical evaluation shows CMA-R better aligns with human judgement of critical tweets compared to attention and other baselines.
- CMA-R allows highlighting impactful words in salient tweets to provide refined interpretability.
- The results demonstrate the importance of considering causality instead of just correlations when interpreting model decisions.
