# [CMA-R:Causal Mediation Analysis for Explaining Rumour Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for explaining neural models for rumour detection mostly rely on attention weights, but attention does not properly capture the causal relations in the decision-making process. There is a need for methods that can identify the tweets and words that causally contribute to a model's veracity predictions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel method called CMA-R (Causal Mediation Analysis for Rumour detection) that is grounded in causal mediation analysis. CMA-R performs interventions at the input level (masking out tweets) to measure the total causal effect of tweets. It also performs interventions at the neuron level (replacing neuron activations) to measure the indirect causal effects of words. This allows CMA-R to identify tweets and words that are causally implicated in the model's predictions.

Experiments:
The authors train neural rumour detection models of differing complexities and compare CMA-R against attention and other interpretation methods on a journalist-annotated rumour dataset that has ground truth turnaround tweets.

Main Contributions:
- CMA-R is the first work to apply causal mediation analysis to open up the blackbox of neural rumour detection models by performing input and neuron interventions.
- Empirical evaluation shows CMA-R better aligns with human judgement of critical tweets compared to attention and other baselines.
- CMA-R allows highlighting impactful words in salient tweets to provide refined interpretability.
- The results demonstrate the importance of considering causality instead of just correlations when interpreting model decisions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called CMA-R that applies causal mediation analysis to interpret neural rumour detection models by intervening at the input and neuron levels to identify tweets and words that have a causal effect on predictions, demonstrating better alignment with human judgments compared to attention and other interpretation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. CMA-R is a novel application of causal mediation analysis to interpret decisions for rumour detection models. It performs interventions at the input and network levels to identify tweets and words that are causally implicated in the final prediction.

2. CMA-R can highlight impactful words in salient tweets via neuron-level interventions, providing a refined mechanism for interpreting rumour detection models. 

3. The empirical findings show that CMA-R aligns more closely with human judgments on a journalist-annotated rumour dataset compared to existing interpretation methods like attention. This demonstrates the importance of considering causal relations rather than just correlations when interpreting model decisions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the CMA-R method for explaining rumour detection models by assessing causal impacts of input tweets and internal neurons through interventions. CMA-R provides improved alignment with human judgments over existing approaches.

The paper proposes a new method called CMA-R that applies causal mediation analysis to explain decisions made by neural models for rumor detection on Twitter. It performs interventions at the input and network levels to determine which tweets and words have the most causal impact on the final predictions. The method is evaluated on a dataset of tweets labeled by journalists and is shown to better identify critical "turnaround" tweets compared to attention-based methods. Overall, the key ideas focus on using ideas of causality rather than just correlation to interpret the inner workings of rumor detection systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind using causal mediation analysis (CMA) for interpreting rumour detection models instead of correlation-based methods like attention? What are the limitations of using attention as explanation that CMA aims to address?

2. Explain the difference between total effect (TE) and indirect effect (IE) in CMA. How does the paper compute TE and IE to determine the tweets and words that are causally implicated in the final rumour verification prediction?

3. The paper experiments with different distance metrics (T1 and T2) to quantify the total and indirect effects in a multi-class rumour detection setting. Compare and contrast these metrics. Which one is better and why?  

4. The paper conducts interventions at both the input level (by masking tweets) and internal model level (by replacing neuron activations). Discuss how these two types of interventions allow explaining predictions from different perspectives. What are the pros and cons?

5. One key contribution is using CMA to extract words that have high causal impacts. Explain how the paper computes indirect effects over different transformer layers to identify salient words. What does the layer-wise analysis reveal?

6. Qualitatively analyzing the extracted salient words in Fig 5, do you think CMA is able to capture words that play an important role in determining rumour veracity? Justify your answer.

7. The paper compares CMA against attention and gradient-based interpretation methods. Why does CMA align better with human judgement of critical tweets that decide veracity? What does this suggest about the importance of causal reasoning for explainability?  

8. The paper analyzes total effects from CMA quantitatively (Table 4). Compare the total effects for different models and discuss potential reasons behind the observations. What hypotheses can you draw for future work?

9. Discuss some limitations of the methodology proposed in the paper. What are other intervention strategies besides input-level and neuron-level that can provide a more comprehensive understanding of rumour detection systems? 

10. The paper focuses primarily on text-based analysis for rumour detection. How can the proposed CMA method be extended to incorporate user-based and propagation-based features for explainability of rumour detection models?
