## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Video Understanding with Large Language Models: A Survey":

Problem:
With the exponential growth in online video content, there is an urgent need for advanced video understanding tools that can efficiently analyze and process videos at scale. However, video understanding remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics in videos. Prior methods using neural networks have limitations in temporal modeling over long sequences and integrating external knowledge. 

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on a new paradigm that applies large language models (LLMs) to video understanding, referred to as Vid-LLMs. LLMs like GPT-3 offer superior natural language processing capabilities. By integrating LLMs with computer vision models in innovative ways, Vid-LLMs aim to achieve more human-like understanding of video content with reasoning skills.

Main Contributions:
- Categorizes recent Vid-LLMs into 4 types: LLM Agents, Vid-LLM Pretraining, Tuning, and Hybrid Methods. Each has unique approaches to combining LLMs with vision models.
- Summarizes tasks, datasets and metrics for evaluating video understanding, covering recognition, captioning, grounding and QA.
- Analyzes Vid-LLM applications across media, interactive technologies, healthcare, security and autonomous vehicles.
- Discusses limitations of current Vid-LLMs including fine-grained understanding over long videos, multi-modal fusion, and human interaction. 
- Outlines future directions such as reducing hallucination in Vid-LLMs and enhancing collaboration between vision and language models.

In summary, this comprehensive survey explores the integration of LLMs with computer vision models for advanced video understanding and reasoning, highlights current progress, applications and open challenges in this nascent field of Vid-LLMs.
