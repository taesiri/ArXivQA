# [SVQ: Sparse Vector Quantization for Spatiotemporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel vector quantization method called Sparse Vector Quantization (SVQ) to improve spatiotemporal forecasting tasks like weather and traffic prediction. SVQ leverages sparse regression to assign each input vector to multiple codes in a large codebook, enabling better generalization by restricting predicted patterns while retaining details. The key innovation is approximating sparse regression using a two-layer MLP and a fixed or learnable matrix, dramatically improving computational efficiency. Experiments across diverse forecasting benchmarks demonstrate SVQ's versatility by boosting various model backbones. When integrated into the non-recurrent SimVP architecture, SVQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming recurrent models like ConvLSTM and transformer-based models like TAU. Ablations verify design choices and reveal SVQ induces sparser, more robust representations. By balancing generalization and retained details, SVQ provides an effective plugin to enhance spatiotemporal forecasting models.
