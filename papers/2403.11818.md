# [TCNet: Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Trajectories and   Correlated Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to translate a sequence of video frames containing gestures into text. A key challenge is to efficiently capture long-range spatial interactions over time from the input video. Prior works have limitations in extracting relevant spatio-temporal patterns over longer durations. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TCNet, a hybrid network with two novel components - a trajectory module and a correlation module - to effectively capture spatio-temporal information. 

The trajectory module transforms frames into trajectories of continuous visual tokens using optical flow. Self-attention is applied along these trajectories to focus on finer-grained patterns (e.g. finger movements). 

The correlation module uses a dynamic attention mechanism to assign queries with dynamic key-value tokens only from correlated regions, filtering out irrelevant regions. This significantly reduces computation and memory costs.

Both modules extract spatial and temporal information in a complementary way. Their outputs are aggregated through element-wise multiplication.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of TCNet with innovative trajectory and correlation modules to improve spatio-temporal feature representation for CSLR
- Trajectory module traces region movements over time and enables focus on finer-grained patterns  
- Correlation module filters irrelevant regions dynamically and assigns dynamic key-values to queries
- State-of-the-art performance on 4 CSLR datasets - Improves prior best by 1.5% and 1.0% WER on Phoenix14 and Phoenix14-T
- Ablation studies validate contributions of each module and robustness to design choices
