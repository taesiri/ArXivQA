# [Comparing Knowledge Sources for Open-Domain Scientific Claim   Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02844)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Most prior work in automated fact-checking of scientific claims assumes the evidence documents are already provided or contained in a small corpus. This is unrealistic for real-world deployment where systems would need to retrieve evidence from knowledge bases with millions of documents. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors perform experiments to test the performance of open-domain scientific claim verification systems. They fix the evidence selection and verdict prediction parts of the pipeline, while varying the knowledge source (PubMed, Wikipedia, Google Search) and the information retrieval technique (BM25 and semantic search). They measure performance by the accuracy of the final verdict prediction on four datasets of scientific claims.

Key Contributions:

- Test claim verification performance using three different knowledge sources and two retrieval techniques over four biomedical claim datasets. 
- Show that PubMed works better for specialized biomedical claims while Wikipedia suits everyday health claims.
- Demonstrate semantic search has higher recall while BM25 has higher precision of relevant evidence.
- Provide analysis of patterns in retrieved evidence and error cases for different types of claims.
- Outline promising future work such as modeling disagreement among evidence and combining retrieval with generative language models.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of knowledge sources and retrieval techniques for open-domain verification of scientific claims. The results highlight trade-offs and motivate future work to develop more robust real-world claim verification systems.
