# [EVAL: Explainable Video Anomaly Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07900)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we develop an effective and explainable framework for video anomaly detection that models scenes in terms of high-level objects and motions?

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question seem to be:

1) Learning general deep networks to estimate high-level appearance (object classes) and motion attributes (directions, speeds) that transfer across environments.

2) Using these networks to extract feature representations of video volumes from a new scene. 

3) Building compact, location-dependent models of the nominal (normal) data of a scene using exemplar selection on the feature representations.

4) Detecting anomalies by comparing features of test video to the exemplar model and using distance in the feature space as an anomaly score.

5) Providing human-understandable explanations for detections by visualizing the high-level appearance and motion attributes.

In summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that modeling scenes in terms of high-level visual attributes can lead to effective and explainable anomaly detection. The method and experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
