# [Using Captum to Explain Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper introduces new features in Captum, an open-source model explainability library for PyTorch, that are designed to analyze and explain the behavior of large generative language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3. 

Problem:
As LLMs are being used more broadly, there is a lack of explainability and transparency into why these models generate certain outputs. Existing attribution methods in Captum are designed more for computer vision models rather than LLMs. There is a need for attribution methods tailored to analyzing text inputs and outputs of LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes new perturbation-based and gradient-based attribution methods in Captum to quantify the impact of input text features on LLM outputs:

- Perturbation-based methods: Allow flexibly defining features like words/phrases to perturb and set appropriate baselines while ensuring valid text. Includes Feature Ablation, Kernel SHAP, LIME.
- Gradient-based methods: Leverage gradient information for token-level attributions.

The methods support selecting target model outputs to explain, like decoded text or log probability of specific string. APIs are provided for easy use.

Main Contributions:
- New Captum APIs for attributing and explaining impacts of text features on LLM outputs, using both perturbation and gradient-based methods. More flexible than prior Captum methods for images.
- Utilities for visualizing text attributions, e.g. heatmaps of token importance scores.
- Demonstrate applications like analyzing learned associations (e.g. biased predictions) and evaluating few-shot prompt effectiveness in LLMs.
- Open-source tooling to increase transparency and explainability for LLMs.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of new features in the open source library Captum that are designed to analyze the behavior of generative language models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper overviews new functionality to apply perturbation-based and gradient-based attribution methods to LLMs in order to understand learned associations and evaluate few-shot prompts. Key aspects of the contribution highlighted in the paper include:

- Flexible APIs for applying perturbation-based methods like LIME, Kernel SHAP, and Shapley Values to LLMs, with support for customizing features, baselines, and masking.

- Simple APIs for applying gradient-based attribution methods like Integrated Gradients and Saliency to LLMs.

- Utilities for visualizing attribution outputs from LLMs. 

- Example applications demonstrating how these methods can provide transparency into an LLM's learned associations and help evaluate few-shot prompt effectiveness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes new features in Captum to analyze generative language models. What are some of the key challenges in explaining the behaviors of large generative language models that Captum aims to address?

2. The paper discusses both perturbation-based and gradient-based attribution methods. What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of each type of method for analyzing generative language models? 

3. The concept of "features" for attribution is important when applying Captum to language models. What considerations should be made when defining features to ensure meaningful attributions? How does the paper suggest balancing feature granularity and validity of perturbations?

4. What role does the choice of baseline play when defining features for attribution with generative language models? What guidance does the paper provide on selecting appropriate baselines? 

5. The paper introduces the ability to group features together through "masking" when applying attribution methods. In what cases might it be beneficial to utilize feature masking when analyzing a language model?

6. What flexibilities does Captum provide in terms of selecting a target function when attributing to language model outputs? How could the choice of target impact interpretation of attribution scores?

7. The paper demonstrates how Captum could be used to analyze learned associations in generative LMs. What are some of the key benefits of using an attribution approach for this purpose rather than solely analyzing model outputs?

8. One application shown is evaluating few-shot prompts. What unexpected results were observed in the example analysis? How could attribution provide insight into these types of observations?

9. How does the Captum API for language models differ from existing libraries like Ecco and Inseq? What unique capabilities does it enable through its design?

10. The conclusion mentions automation of feature and baseline selection as an area for future work. What challenges exist in automating these choices when applying attribution methods to language models?
