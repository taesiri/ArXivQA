# [WinoViz: Probing Visual Properties of Objects Under Different States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Previous work on probing visual commonsense knowledge in language models has focused primarily on typical properties like color and shape. This paper argues that studying reasoning about how visual properties change across different object states is an important but underexplored direction.

- The paper introduces a new textual QA dataset called WinoViz with 1,380 examples that require reasoning about how everyday objects exhibit different visual attributes in various contexts or scenarios. 

Proposed Solution:
- The WinoViz dataset has a single-hop and more challenging multi-hop reasoning version. The multi-hop version replaces visual attribute words with object words that share similar attributes, requiring models to make an additional reasoning step.

- The paper benchmarks performance of several state-of-the-art language models (LMs) including BERT, T5, GPT variants, vision-language models like VL-BERT, and also explores using image generation.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the new WinoViz dataset that focuses on reasoning about changing object attributes across contexts/states.

- Thorough benchmarking revealing that large LMs do well on WinoViz single-hop but struggle on multi-hop, vision-language models outperform LMs, and poor quality of generated images limits their utility.  

- Analysis finding pragmatic reasoning performance is much higher than visual reasoning, indicating the latter is the key bottleneck.

- Demonstrates the broader need for better techniques to transfer visual knowledge into language models to enhance their real-world reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents WinoViz, a text-only evaluation dataset probing language models' reasoning abilities regarding different visual properties of objects across contexts, finding that large models perform well overall but struggle on multi-hop reasoning while vision-language models outperform language-only models, though generated images prove unhelpful.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of \data, a new text-only evaluation dataset consisting of 1,380 examples that probe language models' reasoning abilities regarding the variant visual properties of objects across different contexts or states.

2) A more challenging version of the dataset called multi-hop data that requires multi-step reasoning chains to solve. 

3) An analysis of various language models (text-only and vision-augmented) on the proposed datasets, leading to findings such as:

- Large language models like GPT-4 perform well on the single-hop task but struggle on the multi-hop version.

- Vision-language models outperform their text-only counterparts.

- Image generation approaches prove ineffective for this particular task.

4) An investigation into different types of reasoning required in the task - pragmatic reasoning and visual knowledge reasoning - finding that the bottleneck lies more in reasoning about visual knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution is the new benchmark and analysis that sheds light on language models' capabilities and limitations in reasoning about the visual properties of objects in varying contexts.

The paper introduces a new dataset called WinoViz to probe the visual reasoning abilities of language models, specifically regarding different visual properties of objects across varying contexts. It examines both standard language models and vision-language models on this dataset in zero-shot and few-shot settings. The analysis also looks at pragmatic vs visual knowledge reasoning and uses image generation to try to improve performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called WinoViz for evaluating language models' reasoning abilities on visual properties of objects. How was this dataset created? What steps were involved in the data collection and annotation process? 

2. The WinoViz dataset contains two versions - single-hop and multi-hop. What is the key difference between these two versions? Why is the multi-hop version considered more challenging?

3. The paper argues that the WinoViz task requires both pragmatic reasoning and visual knowledge reasoning. Can you explain what each of these types of reasoning refers to? What examples illustrate the need for both?

4. Several language models like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and vision-language models like VL-BERT, Oscar, LLaVA were evaluated on the WinoViz dataset. What were the key findings from these experiments? Which model performed the best and why?

5. The paper experimented with few-shot learning using both standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. What results did these techniques yield on the WinoViz task? When was chain-of-thought more beneficial?  

6. For encoder-only models like BERT, a different evaluation approach was adopted using NLI fine-tuning. Can you explain this adapted approach? How did the vision-language encoder models compare to the BERT baseline?

7. An analysis is provided in the paper to identify whether pragmatic reasoning vs visual knowledge reasoning poses a bigger bottleneck. What was the outcome? What do the results across models suggest?

8. The paper also experimented with image generation using Stable Diffusion and options like CLIP similarity, BLIP captions etc. Why did these generated images not help improve performance on WinoViz? What percentage of images were uninformative?

9. The WinoViz dataset focuses specifically on evaluating knowledge of visual properties of objects in different contextual states. How does this goal differ from prior work on evaluating visual commonsense knowledge in language models?

10. What are some limitations of the current work that are acknowledged by the authors? What potential improvements or future work directions are discussed to address these limitations?
