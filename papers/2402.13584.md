# [WinoViz: Probing Visual Properties of Objects Under Different States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Previous work on probing visual commonsense knowledge in language models has focused primarily on typical properties like color and shape. This paper argues that studying reasoning about how visual properties change across different object states is an important but underexplored direction.

- The paper introduces a new textual QA dataset called WinoViz with 1,380 examples that require reasoning about how everyday objects exhibit different visual attributes in various contexts or scenarios. 

Proposed Solution:
- The WinoViz dataset has a single-hop and more challenging multi-hop reasoning version. The multi-hop version replaces visual attribute words with object words that share similar attributes, requiring models to make an additional reasoning step.

- The paper benchmarks performance of several state-of-the-art language models (LMs) including BERT, T5, GPT variants, vision-language models like VL-BERT, and also explores using image generation.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the new WinoViz dataset that focuses on reasoning about changing object attributes across contexts/states.

- Thorough benchmarking revealing that large LMs do well on WinoViz single-hop but struggle on multi-hop, vision-language models outperform LMs, and poor quality of generated images limits their utility.  

- Analysis finding pragmatic reasoning performance is much higher than visual reasoning, indicating the latter is the key bottleneck.

- Demonstrates the broader need for better techniques to transfer visual knowledge into language models to enhance their real-world reasoning abilities.
