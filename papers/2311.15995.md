# [Sensitivity-Based Layer Insertion for Residual and Feedforward Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15995)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a systematic method for inserting new layers into neural networks during training, eliminating the need to choose a fixed architecture a priori. The technique utilizes first-order sensitivity information of the objective function with respect to the parameters of potential new layers to determine the most promising insertion point. Specifically, the norm of the gradient of the objective function with respect to these virtual parameters provides a notion of merit for inserting a layer at a given position. The method supports both feedforward neural networks, using identity initialization for ReLU networks, and residual networks where new layers are initialized to identity mappings. Experiments on a spiral classification dataset demonstrate that inserting layers based on the proposed sensitivity-driven placement tends to accelerate training decay compared to fixed-architecture baselines. The approach also exhibits better efficiency than training the larger architecture from the start. While relying only on local gradient information, the method provides a simple and effective means to automatically adapt neural network depth during learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a sensitivity-based layer insertion technique to systematically insert new layers into feedforward and residual neural networks during training, eliminating the need to choose a fixed network architecture a priori.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a systematic method to insert new layers into neural networks during training. Specifically:

- They develop a general framework to increase the depth of neural networks by inserting layers during training, eliminating the need to choose a fixed architecture before starting training. 

- They propose techniques to determine where to insert new layers based on the sensitivity of the objective function to virtual parameters associated with potential new layers. This borrows ideas from constrained optimization.

- They provide initialization strategies for the parameters of newly inserted layers in both feedforward and residual networks to enable taking advantage of the richer function space. 

- They demonstrate in numerical experiments that the proposed sensitivity-based layer insertion technique can lead to improved training decay compared to not inserting the layer. It also reduces computational effort compared to having the layer from the beginning.

In summary, the key contribution is a method to automatically adapt neural network architectures during training by systematically inserting new layers using sensitivity analysis, without the need for upfront neural architecture search.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a sensitivity-based notion of merit to determine the best place to insert a new layer in the network during training. How does this relate to concepts from sensitivity analysis and constrained optimization? What assumptions does the derivation rely on?

2. The paper initializes newly inserted layers to realize the identity function. For ResNets this is straightforward, but how is it achieved for ReLU networks? What constraints does this put on where new layers can be inserted?

3. The experiments insert new layers at iteration 450. What impact would inserting much earlier or much later have? What guidelines should be followed to determine the best insertion point? 

4. The method can insert multiple new layers simultaneously. How could the merit notion and constrained optimization perspective be extended to jointly determine the optimal number and placement of multiple new layers?

5. The paper uses full-batch GD for simplicity. How would the method need to be adapted for minibatch SGD? What new challenges arise?

6. The method relies only on local gradient information. What are some ideas to derive more global optimality-related insertion criteria based e.g. on loss function approximations?

7. What modifications would the method need to also insert new neurons into existing layers, not just new layers? How to determine number and connectivity of new neurons?

8. The method is currently based on fixed learning rate schedules. How could it be extended to work jointly with adaptive regularization or optimization methods?

9. What other neural network architectures besides FNNs and ResNets could the method be applied to? What architecture-specific adaptations would be required?

10. The experiments only consider spiral dataset classification. What more complex datasets and tasks should be investigated to further validate the method? Are there tasks where it would be expected to struggle?
