# [A Morphologically-Aware Dictionary-based Data Augmentation Technique for   Machine Translation of Under-Represented Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation models require large parallel corpora, but most languages lack sufficient parallel data.
- Traditional dictionary-based MT approaches have limitations in coverage and handling morphology.
- Recent neural MT models perform poorly on low-resource languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a morphology-aware dictionary-based data augmentation technique using a small parallel "seed" corpus. 
- Align words between seed sentence pairs and analyze morphology.
- Replace source words with random lexicon words with same morphology. 
- Generate new target words using morphology and bilingual dictionaries.
- Create synthetic parallel sentences likely to be grammatical.
- Filter sentences using language models. 
- Combine synthetic data with seed parallel data to train MT models.

Key Contributions:
- Propose linguistically-informed strategies to synthesize parallel text using morphology and bilingual lexicons. 
- Show improved MT quality from adding synthetic data across 28 English<->X language pairs spanning 14 languages and resourcing levels.
- Demonstrate effectiveness even with as little as 5 seed sentence pairs when morphology and dictionaries are utilized.
- Compare performance boost from morphologically-informed vs naive augmentation.
- Analyze how synthetic data integration impacts extremely low-resource languages.

In summary, the key insight is that linguistic knowledge from morphology and bilingual dictionaries can be exploited along with a small parallel corpus to synthesize new grammatical parallel text and improve low-resource neural MT. The morphology-aware augmentation is broadly effective across language pairs and resourcing levels.
