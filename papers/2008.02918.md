# [Polysemy Deciphering Network for Robust Human-Object Interaction   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02918)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net) to address the challenging verb polysemy problem in human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The core idea is to decode the visual polysemy of verbs in three ways: 1) Generate polysemy-aware features using two novel modules - Language Prior-guided Channel Attention (LPCA) and Language Prior-based Feature Augmentation (LPFA). LPCA highlights important elements in appearance features while LPFA provides hints to reduce intra-class variation of spatial and pose features. 2) Introduce a Polysemy-Aware Modal Fusion (PAMF) module to dynamically fuse different feature types based on their importance inferred from language priors. This highlights features critical for each HOI category. 3) Propose Clustering-based Object-Specific (CSP) classifiers that group semantically similar categories to share classifiers while distinguishing meanings of the same verb across categories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET, V-COCO and a new HOI-VerbPolysemy benchmark. The consistent significant gains verify PD-Net's effectiveness in tackling the verb polysemy challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net) with several novel components to address the verb polysemy problem in human-object interaction detection by producing polysemy-aware features, fusing different feature streams adaptively, and sharing classifiers between semantically similar interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net) to address the challenging verb polysemy problem in human-object interaction (HOI) detection. Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

1) It identifies and highlights the verb polysemy problem in HOI detection, which is relatively underexplored in existing works. The verb polysemy problem refers to the issue that a verb can convey substantially different visual characteristics when associated with different objects.

2) It proposes four novel components in the PD-Net to explicitly handle the verb polysemy problem:
- Language Prior-guided Channel Attention (LPCA) 
- Language Prior-based Feature Augmentation (LPFA)
- Polysemy-Aware Modal Fusion (PAMF)
- Clustering-based Object-Specific (CSP) classifiers

3) It constructs a new benchmark dataset named HOI-VerbPolysemy (HOI-VP) to facilitate research on the verb polysemy problem in HOI detection.

4) Extensive experiments show that by explicitly modeling and handling the verb polysemy problem, the proposed PD-Net significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three HOI detection benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution lies in the proposal of the PD-Net to explicitly address the verb polysemy problem in HOI detection, which is a key issue but relatively under-studied previously. Both technically through the new model components and through the construct of a new dataset, this paper pushes the frontier of HOI detection research.
