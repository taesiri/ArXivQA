# [Attacking the Loop: Adversarial Attacks on Graph-based Loop Closure   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06991)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel black-box evasion attack framework called Adversarial-LCD for attacking graph-based loop closure detection in visual SLAM systems. It utilizes an eigencentrality graph perturbation method to efficiently select influential nodes to perturb, a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor to generate feature vectors from perturbed graphs, and an SVM-RBF surrogate model to learn the graph attack space. Experiments demonstrate that Adversarial-LCD with SVM-RBF surrogate achieves superior attack performance compared to SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial and Bayesian classifier surrogates. Further experiments show the eigencentrality perturbation method significantly outperforms random walk and shortest path methods in attack efficiency. The method poses a serious threat as small graph perturbations are difficult to detect but can substantially degrade loop closure detection. Future work will explore adversarial defense techniques like adversarial learning to improve robustness of graph-based loop closure detection against such attacks.
