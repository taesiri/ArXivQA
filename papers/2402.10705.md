# [AutoSAT: Automatically Optimize SAT Solvers via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is an NP-complete problem with many real-world applications. SAT solvers rely heavily on heuristics to achieve good performance, but designing effective heuristics is challenging. 
- Different SAT instances can benefit from different heuristics. Manually optimizing heuristics for each instance requires significant human effort.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents AutoSAT, a framework to automatically optimize heuristics in SAT solvers using Large Language Models (LLMs).

- AutoSAT implements a multi-agent mechanism with three collaborative agents - Advisor, Evaluator, and Coder.

- The Advisor reviews the solver code and provides optimization advice. 

- The Evaluator assesses the performance of generated codes and provides feedback.

- The Coder modifies the heuristic code based on advice and feedback.

- This creates an automated feedback loop that iteratively improves the heuristics.

- AutoSAT uses prompt engineering to ensure agents share context and generate valid, non-identical code.

- A fault tolerance mechanism prevents introduction of erroneous code.

Main Contributions:

- AutoSAT enables plug-and-play heuristic optimization using LLMs without extensive setup or model training.

- It reduces human effort needed to refine solvers for specific problem instances.

- The automated feedback loop and multi-agent mechanism improve efficiency.

- Experiments optimizing a CDCL solver demonstrate superior performance on SAT competition benchmarks.

- AutoSAT generates heuristics that achieve excellent results on chromatic number plane partitioning and setting covering with conflicts problems.

- The framework is generalizable to improving other computational solvers beyond SAT.

In summary, AutoSAT leverages the power of LLMs to automate the challenging task of generating high-quality, customized heuristics to boost SAT solver performance. The plug-and-play nature and multi-agent feedback system enhance automation and effectiveness.
