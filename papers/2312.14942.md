# [Liquid State Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14942)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard genetic programming (GP) faces challenges in solving difficult problems like the even-parity problem. GP has only solved up to the 5-bit even parity problem within reasonable time.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a new technique called Liquid State Genetic Programming (LSGP) which is a hybrid of GP and Liquid State Machines. 
- LSGP uses a 'liquid' - a pool of dynamically changing items to store and preprocess inputs before feeding to the GP solver. The liquid acts as a short-term memory to transform inputs into a more easily solvable form.

- The liquid has genetically-inspired recombination and insertion operators to manipulate its content over generations. The actual solver is still a standard GP.

- An LSGP individual hence contains the liquid and a GP tree which takes inputs from the liquid items.

Contributions:
- LSGP is shown to outperform standard GP on hard problems like even-parity. It could solve up to 8-bit even parity compared to 5 bits by standard GP.

- The liquid's representation makes fitness evaluation faster than standard GP trees. But overall LSGP is comparable in complexity to GP.

- The paper introduces the novel concept of a genetically manipulated liquid memory for preprocessing inputs to help GP performance.

- Detailed descriptions of the liquid item representation, genetic operators on liquid and the overall LSGP algorithm are provided.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in improving GP through a liquid-based dynamic memory structure and demonstrates superior performance on hard problems.
