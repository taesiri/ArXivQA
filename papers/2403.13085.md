# [Subgoal Diffuser: Coarse-to-fine Subgoal Generation to Guide Model   Predictive Control for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods are effective for robotic manipulation of articulated and deformable objects as they can quickly adapt to disturbances. However, they are limited to short time horizons which makes them unsuitable for complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks involving local minima. Existing learned generative models for manipulation either output full dense trajectories, which are inefficient, or use a fixed hierarchy, which lacks flexibility.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a method called Subgoal Diffuser that generates subgoals in a hierarchical and coarse-to-fine manner to guide an MPC controller to accomplish long-horizon tasks. It has the following key components:

1) A diffusion-based model that generates sequences of subgoals recursively from coarse to fine by conditioning the finer subgoals on coarser ones. This allows variable resolution. 

2) A reachability-based metric learned on the dataset to determine the necessary subgoal density. More subgoals are generated if adjacent ones are estimated to be unreachable by the MPC controller.

3) Redistribution of previous level subgoals based on reachability so that more subgoals are placed in challenging parts. 

4) An MPC controller that tracks the subgoals, with the ability to skip subgoals.

Main Contributions:

- A diffusion-based framework to generate subgoals at different resolutions in a hierarchical manner

- An adaptive way to determine suitable subgoal density for a task based on a learned reachability measure 

- Demonstrated system integrating subgoal generation with MPC on complex manipulation tasks

- Experimental validation showing improved planning performance over baselines and ability to guide an MPC method to accomplish difficult long-horizon tasks

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed Subgoal Diffuser architecture that produces multiresolution subgoals to provide varying guidance to an MPC controller, with a data-driven strategy to decide on suitable subgoal density. This effectively prevents myopic MPC methods from getting stuck in local minima for complex manipulation tasks.
