## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based graph generative methods, with a focus on recent advances in applying diffusion models to molecular and motion graph generation tasks. 

It first introduces the key paradigms behind diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), score-based generative models (SGMs), and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. It explains how these models work by adding noise to data during a forward "diffusion" process, then learning to reverse this process during sampling by removing noise in a stepwise fashion.

The paper then systematically reviews applications of diffusion models to graph generation across two key areas - molecular graph generation and motion graph generation. 

For molecular graph generation, it summarizes recent works on using diffusion models for tasks like de novo molecular design, molecular conformation generation, ligand generation, protein structure generation and more. For each task, it describes model innovations and summarizes evaluation metrics used. Overall, diffusion models have shown strong promise in generating valid, novel and high quality molecular graphs and geometries.

For motion graph generation, the paper focuses on human motion synthesis and prediction tasks. It describes how diffusion models have been adapted to generate natural and text/audio-conditional motions, as well as forecast future motion sequences. Relevant datasets and evaluation metrics are also covered.

Finally, the paper discusses limitations of current research and suggests promising future directions, like designing better training objectives and metrics tailored to graphs, tackling graph discreteness issues, expanding application domains beyond molecules and motion, and enhancement with large language models.

Overall, this paper provides a holistic overview of the state-of-the-art in applying modern diffusion generative models to graph structured data across multiple domains. It highlights key innovations and evaluations, while pointing out open challenges for future work.
