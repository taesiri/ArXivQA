# [Beyond Spatio-Temporal Representations: Evolving Fourier Transform for   Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing spectral graph analysis methods like Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) work for static graphs but don't capture the evolving graph structure over time. 
- Applying GFT at each timestep loses distinction between temporal and vertex domain variations. Doing joint eigendecomposition over entire temporal graph is prohibitively expensive (O((NT)^3)).
- There exists no invertible transform to capture evolving spectra of temporal graphs along both time and vertex dimensions.

Proposed Solution:
- View the problem as optimizing variational form of Laplacian over dynamic graph. Use pseudospectrum relaxation to get simplified and efficient solution.
- Propose Evolving Fourier Transform (EFT) as Kronecker product of Discrete Fourier Transform (along time) and Graph Fourier Transform (along vertices). Captures both temporal and vertex domain frequencies.
- Show difference between EFT and exact eigendecomposition solution is bounded under assumptions of Lipschitz continuity. So EFT approximates true solution well.
- Implement simple model using EFT to filter signals on dynamic graphs. Has complexity O(NTlogT) compared to O((NT)^3) for exact solution.

Main Contributions:
- First invertible spectral transform for temporal graphs that captures evolving graph structure.
- Theoretically grounded. Bounded error w.r.t true eigendecomposition. Computationally efficient. 
- Develops simple neural architecture induced with EFT. Shows state-of-the-art performance on various temporal graph datasets.
- Opens possibilities for dynamic graph analysis using the proposed spectral representations.
