# [Beyond Spatio-Temporal Representations: Evolving Fourier Transform for   Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing spectral graph analysis methods like Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) work for static graphs but don't capture the evolving graph structure over time. 
- Applying GFT at each timestep loses distinction between temporal and vertex domain variations. Doing joint eigendecomposition over entire temporal graph is prohibitively expensive (O((NT)^3)).
- There exists no invertible transform to capture evolving spectra of temporal graphs along both time and vertex dimensions.

Proposed Solution:
- View the problem as optimizing variational form of Laplacian over dynamic graph. Use pseudospectrum relaxation to get simplified and efficient solution.
- Propose Evolving Fourier Transform (EFT) as Kronecker product of Discrete Fourier Transform (along time) and Graph Fourier Transform (along vertices). Captures both temporal and vertex domain frequencies.
- Show difference between EFT and exact eigendecomposition solution is bounded under assumptions of Lipschitz continuity. So EFT approximates true solution well.
- Implement simple model using EFT to filter signals on dynamic graphs. Has complexity O(NTlogT) compared to O((NT)^3) for exact solution.

Main Contributions:
- First invertible spectral transform for temporal graphs that captures evolving graph structure.
- Theoretically grounded. Bounded error w.r.t true eigendecomposition. Computationally efficient. 
- Develops simple neural architecture induced with EFT. Shows state-of-the-art performance on various temporal graph datasets.
- Opens possibilities for dynamic graph analysis using the proposed spectral representations.

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Evolving Fourier Transform (EFT), which is the first invertible spectral transform that captures evolving representations on temporal graphs. Specifically:
