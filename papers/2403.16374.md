# [ProIn: Learning to Predict Trajectory Based on Progressive Interactions   for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Motion prediction of traffic participants like pedestrians and vehicles is important for autonomous driving, but is very challenging due to various uncertainties such as unknown intentions of neighbors and complex influence of maps.  
- Existing methods use one-stage interaction between agents and maps, which makes it difficult to encode all required map constraints into agents' features for retaining possible intention paths while adapting to social interactions.

Proposed Solution:
- A progressive interaction network (ProIn) is proposed to enable agents to progressively acquire map information through multi-stage interactions with maps.
- There are three map-agent interaction modules at different stages: after trajectory encoder, after social interaction module, and after multi-modal differentiation. This allows encoding map constraints suitable for different downstream tasks.
- A weight allocation mechanism is also proposed to train all prediction branches using a single ground truth trajectory, avoiding mode collapse issue.

Main Contributions:
- A progressive interaction network that incorporates map information into agents' features at different levels through multi-stage interactions. This leads to better feature representations.
- A weight allocation loss that changes the learning strength of each prediction branch based on its prediction quality. This allows a single ground truth to train multi-modal outputs.
- Experiments show ProIn outperforms previous vector-based methods on Argoverse benchmark, validating the progressive interaction design and weight allocation loss. Both components demonstrate effectiveness through ablations.

In summary, this paper proposes a progressive interaction network and a weight allocation loss to address challenges of motion prediction in autonomous driving. The progressive interaction network better fuses map context through multi-stage interactions with maps. And the allocation loss avoids mode collapse issue in multi-modal prediction training. Experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods and effectiveness of each component.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper proposes a progressive interaction network that enables agents to progressively acquire map information through multi-stage graph convolutions for improved context modeling and trajectory prediction in autonomous driving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are two-fold:

1. It proposes a progressive interaction network that enables agents to gradually acquire map information at different levels through multi-stage interactions. Specifically, it incorporates map information into agent features at three different stages - after the historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. This allows the network to better learn agent feature representations that capture relevant map constraints.

2. It proposes a weight allocation mechanism for multi-modal prediction training. This allows a single-mode ground truth trajectory to be used to train multiple prediction branches with different weights based on their accuracy on each sample. This helps alleviate mode collapse and sample inefficiency issues in multi-modal prediction.

In summary, the key innovations are around a novel progressive agent-map interaction architecture and a new loss function for multi-modal trajectory forecasting. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these contributions on the Argoverse benchmarks.
