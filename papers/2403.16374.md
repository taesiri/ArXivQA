# [ProIn: Learning to Predict Trajectory Based on Progressive Interactions   for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Motion prediction of traffic participants like pedestrians and vehicles is important for autonomous driving, but is very challenging due to various uncertainties such as unknown intentions of neighbors and complex influence of maps.  
- Existing methods use one-stage interaction between agents and maps, which makes it difficult to encode all required map constraints into agents' features for retaining possible intention paths while adapting to social interactions.

Proposed Solution:
- A progressive interaction network (ProIn) is proposed to enable agents to progressively acquire map information through multi-stage interactions with maps.
- There are three map-agent interaction modules at different stages: after trajectory encoder, after social interaction module, and after multi-modal differentiation. This allows encoding map constraints suitable for different downstream tasks.
- A weight allocation mechanism is also proposed to train all prediction branches using a single ground truth trajectory, avoiding mode collapse issue.

Main Contributions:
- A progressive interaction network that incorporates map information into agents' features at different levels through multi-stage interactions. This leads to better feature representations.
- A weight allocation loss that changes the learning strength of each prediction branch based on its prediction quality. This allows a single ground truth to train multi-modal outputs.
- Experiments show ProIn outperforms previous vector-based methods on Argoverse benchmark, validating the progressive interaction design and weight allocation loss. Both components demonstrate effectiveness through ablations.

In summary, this paper proposes a progressive interaction network and a weight allocation loss to address challenges of motion prediction in autonomous driving. The progressive interaction network better fuses map context through multi-stage interactions with maps. And the allocation loss avoids mode collapse issue in multi-modal prediction training. Experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods and effectiveness of each component.
