# [Multi-view Distillation based on Multi-modal Fusion for Few-shot Action   Recognition(CLIP-$\mathrm{M^2}$DF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Few-shot action recognition aims to recognize novel action categories given only a few labeled video samples per category. Two key challenges are:
1) How to represent spatiotemporal video sequences in a distinguishable way with limited data.  
2) How to effectively match query and support sequences for recognition. Overlapping class distributions and outliers in classes often degrade recognition accuracy even with good solutions to the above problems.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Multi-view Distillation framework based on Multi-modal Fusion (CLIP-M2DF) to address the challenges. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce consistent class-specific information for both support and query videos using CLIP text embeddings derived from class name descriptions. This is more robust than sample-specific visual features alone. A novel Probability Prompt Selector adaptively chooses prompt embeddings for queries based on their visual similarity to supports.

2) Extract multi-view multi-modal features capturing both global and local temporal video contexts, each fused with text and visual embeddings. This overcomes overlapping distributions and outliers better than single view features.  

3) Apply multi-view distillation with distance fusion and bidirectional knowledge transfer to make the views teach other, enhancing robustness.

Main Contributions:

1) A new Multi-view Distillation framework performing multi-modal fusion for few-shot action recognition. 

2) A Probability Prompt Selector to enable consistent class-specific conditioning of both support and query features.

3) Multi-view multi-modal encoders fusing text, visual and temporal context features, overcoming overlapping class distributions and outliers.

4) Multi-view distillation with distance fusion and bidirectional knowledge transfer between the views.

Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, showing the effectiveness of the approach. Both visualizations and ablations validate the utility of each component.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-view distillation framework based on multi-modal fusion using CLIP for few-shot action recognition, which introduces probability prompt embeddings for queries, extracts local and global temporal contexts, fuses text and visual features in each view, and performs mutual distillation between views to improve performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are summarized as follows:

(1) It proposes a framework of Multi-view Distillation based on Multi-modal Fusion for few-shot action recognition.

(2) In the multi-modal prototype matching paradigm based on CLIP, it proposes a new concept of probability prompt embedding to compensate for the information inconsistency between prototypes and queries to utilize labels efficiently. 

(3) It proposes multi-view context extractors to get features from two views - local and global temporal contexts. In each view, a Cross-Transformer is used to fuse the prompt embedding and visual features.

(4) It performs fusion and distillation between the two views to enable the model to register the multi-modal features from global and local temporal contexts, thereby enabling it to learn more general features.

(5) Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a multi-view distillation framework based on multi-modal fusion to enhance few-shot action recognition. The key ideas include using probability prompt embedding, multi-view context extraction and fusion, and mutual distillation between views.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Few-shot action recognition - The paper focuses on few-shot action recognition, where only a few labeled video examples are available for each action class.

- Multi-view distillation - The proposed method uses multi-view distillation, with two views focusing on local and global temporal contexts respectively. Distillation occurs between these views.

- Multi-modal fusion - The method fuses multi-modal features, including visual features, text (label) features, and temporal context. This is done for each view using a Cross Transformer. 

- Probability prompt embedding - A novel concept proposed in the paper where probability prompt embeddings are generated for query videos in addition to support videos. This helps provide more consistent information between queries and supports.

- CLIP backbone - The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model is used as the backbone for encoding visual and text features.

- Knowledge distillation - The concept of knowledge distillation, where multiple models teach each other, is leveraged for the multi-view distillation component.

In summary, the key focus is on few-shot video recognition using multi-view multi-modal fusion and distillation based on the CLIP model. The probability prompt embedding is also a notable novel technique introduced.
