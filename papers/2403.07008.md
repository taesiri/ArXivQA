# [AutoEval Done Right: Using Synthetic Data for Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating machine learning models requires large amounts of human-labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. 
- Using synthetic/auto-generated labels from AI systems could reduce the annotation cost, but synthetic labels may be biased and not trustworthy.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a methodology called "autoevaluation done right" that combines a small set of human labels with a large set of synthetic labels to evaluate models more efficiently. 
- Use an estimation method called Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that debias the synthetic labels using the human labels, making the evaluation unbiased and more statistically rigorous.

Key Contributions:
- Develop PPI estimators for common evaluation metrics like accuracy, loss, fairness metrics etc. that are unbiased and have lower variance than classical estimators.
- Extend PPI method to evaluate relative model performance from pairwise comparisons, using the Bradley-Terry model.
- Demonstrate the PPI approach on ImageNet data to evaluate vision models and on Chatbot Arena data to rank language models. Results show tighter confidence intervals and improved ranking accuracy.  
- Provide an easy-to-use Python package to apply the PPI methodology for model evaluation.

In summary, the paper develops a practical methodology and tools for autoevaluation by combining human and synthetic labels that leads to more precise and statistically valid assessment of machine learning models while reducing annotation costs. The approach is shown to improve upon classical evaluation methods on real-world testing cases.
