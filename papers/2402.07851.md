# [Comparing skill of historical rainfall data based monsoon rainfall   prediction in India with NCEP-NWP forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Accurate prediction of monsoon rainfall in India is critical for agriculture, disaster management, etc. but numerical weather prediction (NWP) models do not perform well currently.  
- It is hypothesized that rainfall data across India has spatial-temporal memory so information from neighboring areas could help in prediction.

Objective and Data
- Compare performance of deep learning models using long-term gridded historical Indian rainfall data (1901-2022) from IMD to benchmark NWP forecasts from NCEP (2011-2022) for next 1 and 3 day rainfall prediction.  

Methods
- Use LSTM and Transformer models on IMD data to get DL-HD forecasts. Compare to persistence forecasts and raw NCEP-NWP forecasts.
- Also create NWP+ forecasts by combining NWP forecasts of neighboring grids using neural network, and NWP+DL-HD ensemble.
- Evaluate performance using peak-biased loss function, as well as metrics for heavy rainfall prediction, false alarms and correlation.

Key Results
- DL-HD forecasts substantially more accurate than NWP and persistence forecasts, for both 1 and 3 day predictions.  
- NWP+ improves over NWP but still worse than DL-HD by 24.4% and 37.4% for 1 and 3 day forecasts resp.
- DL-HD much better at capturing heavy rainfalls without false alarms. NWP tends to overestimate.
- Increasing context in DL-HD models using past 20 day data helps reduce error showing long-term memory.

Conclusion  
- More diverse data combined with suitable deep learning models can significantly improve on current NWP rainfall forecasts for Indian monsoons.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper compares monsoon rainfall forecasts across India from deep learning models trained on historical data, numerical weather predictions, and persistence, finding that the deep learning forecasts outperform the others in accuracy while Numerical weather predictions tend to overestimate rainfall.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper conducts a detailed comparison of monsoon rainfall forecasts for India using deep learning models trained on historical rainfall data (DL-HD) versus numerical weather prediction (NWP) models from NCEP. The key findings are:

1) DL-HD models provide significantly more accurate 1-day and 3-day forecasts compared to NWP across India, with 34-69% lower error. They also outperform a persistence forecast baseline.

2) NWP forecasts can be improved by combining with neighboring grid forecasts (NWP+), but still underperform compared to DL-HD. Combining NWP with DL-HD (NWP+DL-HD) leads to some improvements over NWP alone but usually does not outperform DL-HD.

3) DL-HD models are better at capturing extreme rainfall events without high false alarm rates. They also show higher correlation to ground truth compared to NWP.

4) Increasing the context length in the DL-HD models leads to slightly improved forecasts, especially when using Transformer architectures.

The key conclusion is that deep learning on historical rainfall data can provide substantially better monsoon forecasts compared to leading numerical models, and has the potential to improve operational forecasts if provided with more diverse and granular data.

The paper compares different methods for forecasting monsoon rainfall in India, including deep learning models trained on historical data, numerical weather prediction models from NCEP, and simple persistence forecasts. It evaluates these forecasts on metrics like error (peak-biased loss), heavy rainfall prediction accuracy, false alarm rates, and correlation with actual observations. The deep learning models use LSTM and Transformer architectures. The key findings are that the deep learning forecasts outperform NWP and persistence, but there is scope to improve NWP through better data and models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares deep learning predictions using historical rainfall data (DL-HD) with numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Why do you think the DL-HD model outperforms NWP by a significant margin in terms of lower peak-biased loss? What factors could contribute to this superior performance?

2. The paper finds that incorporating information from past rainfall data up to 20 days improves the DL-HD model's performance, especially when using a Transformer architecture. Why do you think longer historical context helps? Does this indicate the presence of long-term temporal dependencies in Indian monsoon rainfall?

3. The paper proposes an ensemble NWP+DL-HD model that combines NWP forecasts with DL predictions. However, this combined model does not significantly outperform the DL-HD model alone. What could be the reasons for this lack of complementary information from NWP to boost performance?

4. How exactly does the peak-biased loss function used for training assign different penalties for over vs. under-estimation errors? Why is this asymmetric loss appropriate for rainfall prediction?

5. The DL-HD model is found to have higher skill in predicting heavy rainfall events (>30mm) compared to NWP, as measured by the Heavy Rainfall Predictor (HRP) metric. Why do you think NWP struggles on this metric specifically? 

6. Explore why false alarm rates are significantly higher for NWP compared to DL-HD and persistence forecasts. Does this indicate inherent biases in the NWP methodology when applied to Indian monsoons?

7. The paper analyzes prediction skill for the 20 most populated cities separately. Are there any location-specific insights you can draw from the city-level results? Do relative model performances change across cities?

8. Can you hypothesize some ways to improve the raw NWP forecasts, apart from using the NWP+ model described? What additional data could be incorporated and how?

9. The study uses a grid size of 1° x 1° for predictions. Do you think higher resolution predictions would significantly change the findings and relative model comparisons? Why/why not?

10. The paper suggests more diverse data combined with carefully selected NN architectures can improve upon NWP forecasts. What specific data modalities and NN architectures would you suggest exploring for monsoon rainfall prediction?
