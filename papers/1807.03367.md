# Talk the Walk: Navigating New York City through Grounded Dialogue

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop artificial agents that can solve challenging tasks requiring language, perception, and action skills. Specifically, the authors introduce a new task called "Talk the Walk" which involves two agents (a "guide" and a "tourist") communicating via natural language dialogue to achieve a common goal - having the tourist navigate to a target location in a virtual grid world. The key research questions this paper seems to address are:- How can agents learn to communicate and collaborate through natural language dialogue for situated tasks requiring perception and action?- How can agents learn to ground language in perception and action for navigation in a virtual environment? - What neural architectures allow agents to effectively learn language grounding for navigation tasks?The authors argue that to acquire human-like language capabilities, agents need to be embodied and interact in environments they can perceive, act in, and communicate about. The Talk the Walk task aims to facilitate research on learning language grounding for situated dialogue agents.The paper introduces the task, dataset, and models for the tourist localization subtask. It proposes a novel neural architecture called Masked Attention for Spatial Convolutions (MASC) to ground natural language in the guide's spatial map for localization. Experiments analyze emergent vs natural language and demonstrate the benefits of the MASC model.In summary, the key hypothesis is that the Talk the Walk task and MASC model will drive progress in learning grounded, interactive agents that can perceive, act, and communicate linguistically. The paper aims to demonstrate the potential of this challenging multimodal dialogue task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the provided paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing the "Talk the Walk" task and dataset, which involves two agents (a "guide" and a "tourist") communicating via natural language to achieve a common goal of the tourist navigating to a target location. This is the first large-scale dialogue dataset grounded in both action and perception.2. Focusing on the important sub-task of tourist localization, and developing a novel "Masked Attention for Spatial Convolutions (MASC)" mechanism to allow grounding of tourist utterances into the guide's map. This is shown to yield significant improvements for both emergent and natural language communication on the localization sub-task. 3. Establishing initial baselines on the full task using the localization models. The best model is shown to exceed human performance under the assumption of perfect perception and with learned emergent communication, while also providing a non-trivial baseline with natural language.In summary, the key contributions are: (1) introducing a new grounded dialogue task/dataset, (2) proposing a novel localization mechanism and demonstrating its benefits, and (3) providing strong baselines on the full task to facilitate future research. The paper frames the full task as an open problem for the community to make additional progress on.
