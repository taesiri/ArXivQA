## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating optimal trajectories for quadrotors with limited field-of-view (FOV) sensors is important for applications like aerial exploration, inspection, videography, and target tracking. 
- Existing methods have limitations in representing the quadrotor's orientation globally and continuously during trajectory optimization. They either restrict the yaw domain to avoid singularities, or optimize position and yaw trajectories separately.
- A key challenge is developing a global yaw parameterization approach that can be incorporated into trajectory optimization to generate optimal position and yaw trajectories simultaneously.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel global yaw parameterization method that allows 360-degree yaw variation during trajectory optimization. 
- It represents the yaw using virtual variables that are transformed to real yaw angles using normalization constraints. This avoids singularities.
- The method is incorporated into a unified trajectory optimization framework with perception constraints like keeping targets in FOV.
- Both convex optimization and nonlinear optimization formulations are presented to generate optimal coupled position and yaw trajectories.

Main Contributions:
- A global yaw parameterization approach for trajectory optimization that circumvents singularities.
- Unified problem formulation and solution approach for different aerial navigation tasks like exploration, inspection and tracking.
- Thorough numerical analysis in simulation and hardware experiments of aerial tracking to demonstrate real-world applicability.
- The method significantly reduces control effort and improves optimization feasibility compared to prior approaches.

In summary, the key novelty is the global yaw parameterization technique that enables effective trajectory optimization under complex perception constraints for quadrotor applications demanding coupled position and yaw planning.
