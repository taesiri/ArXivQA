# [Data Science with LLMs and Interpretable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent progress has been made in building interpretable machine learning models that are designed to be more understandable to humans. However, there is untapped potential in combining these models with large language models (LLMs).

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors explore combining interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. 
- GAMs model complex outcomes as a sum of univariate component functions, which allows the LLM to analyze the model one component at a time. 
- The individual model components are provided as text to the LLM, along with the overall model and prompts.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that LLMs can successfully describe, interpret and debug GAM models by analyzing individual components.
- Shows examples of an LLM generating model summaries, answering questions, finding anomalies, suggesting hypotheses, etc when paired with a GAM.
- Finds that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 at numerical and graphical reasoning with GAM components.
- Discusses evidence that LLM responses are frequently grounded in the provided GAMs rather than hallucinating. 
- Shows the potential to improve domain expert interaction with interpretable ML and jointly leverage strengths of LLMs and model interpretability.

In summary, the key insight is that pairing interpretable models with LLMs can enable new semi-automated applications for model understanding, dataset analysis and more. The results showcase promising capabilities even with preliminary prompting strategies.
