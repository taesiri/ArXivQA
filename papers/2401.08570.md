# [RoHM: Robust Human Motion Reconstruction via Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing realistic 3D human motion from monocular RGB or RGB-D videos is challenging, especially in the presence of noise and occlusions. Existing methods either train neural networks to directly regress 3D poses, resulting in temporally inconsistent motions, or use optimization techniques with handcrafted/learned motion priors, being prone to local minima and slow at test time.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes RoHM, a robust human motion reconstruction approach using diffusion models. The key ideas are:

1) Decompose the problem into reconstructing global root trajectory and local body motion with two separate diffusion models (TrajNet and PoseNet). This simplifies learning compared to jointly modeling them.

2) Introduce TrajControl module to capture inter-dependencies between root and body motion. It provides pose features as control signal to refine TrajNet.

3) Use iterative inference scheme leveraging the three components to progressively improve global and local motion estimates.

4) Further enhance reconstruction by guiding PoseNet sampling at test time with scores measuring physical plausibility and 2D joint consistency.

Contributions:
1) Novel diffusion-based formulation for robust monocular human motion reconstruction dealing with noise and occlusions.

2) Flexible conditioning of global trajectory on both noisy input and denoised body poses during iterative inference.

3) Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on tasks like motion denoising, infilling etc. on AMASS, PROX and EgoBody datasets, being 30x faster than optimization-based techniques.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to leverage the iterative denoising capability and flexible conditioning of diffusion models to achieve robust reconstruction of complete 3D human motions from monocular RGB(-D) videos. The proposed decomposition and iterative inference scheme allows handling effectively noise, occlusions and missing data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 RoHM is a diffusion-based approach for robust 3D human motion reconstruction from monocular RGB(-D) videos in the presence of noise and occlusions, by learning separate models for global trajectory and local articulated motion and leveraging an iterative inference scheme.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing RoHM, a novel diffusion-based approach for robust human motion reconstruction from monocular RGB(-D) sequences in the presence of noise and occlusions. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Learning two separate diffusion models, TrajNet and PoseNet, to reconstruct global trajectory and local articulated motion respectively. This decomposition addresses the task complexity and enables conditioning the models on available image evidence.

2) Introducing TrajControl, a flexible conditioning module to capture inter-dependencies between root trajectory and body pose, refined through an iterative inference scheme. 

3) Demonstrating the capability of RoHM in various applications including motion reconstruction, denoising, and spatial/temporal infilling. Extensive experiments show RoHM outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based methods in terms of accuracy and motion realism.

In summary, the main novelty lies in leveraging diffusion models for robust monocular human motion reconstruction, through the decomposition and correlation modeling between the global and local motion spaces. This leads to improved performance over strong baselines.
