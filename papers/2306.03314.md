## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) through multi-agent collaboration. Here is a high-level comparison to other related research:- Compared to single agent systems like Auto-GPT and BabyAGI, this paper proposes using multiple agents with distinct roles and capabilities that can collaborate and share knowledge.

However, this paper provides a more formalized framework and graph representation for multi-agent LLMs.- Modeling interactions as a graph network is a common technique in multi-agent reinforcement learning research. However, this paper applies it specifically to collaborative LLMs rather than RL agents.- The proposed framework shares similarities to hybrid AI systems like Gorilla that combine LLMs with retrieval models. However, this paper focuses on collaboration between multiple LLMs rather than between a LLM and a retriever.- Compared to Mosaic and other ensemble methods, the agents in this framework are designed to be more specialized, autonomous, and collaborative rather than just parallel or combined.- The concepts of adjustable system design, dynamic agent addition, halting mechanisms, and oracle agents provide novel contributions compared to prior multi-agent LLM research.Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in leveraging multi-agent interactions to enhance LLM capabilities. The formal framework and graph representation in particular are novel contributions compared to related literature. Implementation and evaluation of the proposed techniques could yield valuable insights.
