# [Automatic Parameter Selection for Non-Redundant Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11952)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Non-redundant clustering algorithms can identify multiple meaningful clusterings in different subspaces of high-dimensional datasets. This reveals different interpretations and structures in the data. 
- However, most existing methods require the user to specify the number of subspaces and number of clusters per subspace as input parameters. This is challenging and requires extensive domain knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a framework that utilizes the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal number of subspaces and number of clusters per subspace. 
- It performs a greedy search through the parameter space by iteratively splitting and merging subspaces, and modifying the number of clusters within those subspaces.
- An MDL-based cost function rates the quality of different parameterizations. The search terminates when the encoding cost cannot be further reduced.

Main Contributions:
- Novel MDL encoding strategy for non-redundant clustering models that works with centroid-based clustering algorithms
- Efficient greedy procedure to navigate the search space and identify optimal parameter values
- Built-in outlier detection per subspace integrated into the MDL cost function, no extra parameters
- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
- Significantly faster than competing methods on high-dimensional data due to operations in lower-dimensional subspaces

In summary, the key innovation is an automated framework to determine the optimal structure of non-redundant clusterings by leveraging the compression-based MDL principle. This eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning.
