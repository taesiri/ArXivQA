# [On the Granular Representation of Fuzzy Quantifier-Based Fuzzy Rough   Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Rough set theory and fuzzy rough set theory are mathematical frameworks that can handle inconsistent and vague data by providing lower and upper approximations of concepts. An important property of these approximations is that they can be represented as unions of elementary sets called granules. Granules correspond to simple "if-then" rules and are useful for rule induction, a key application of rough sets. Previous work showed that ordered weighted average (OWA) based fuzzy rough sets have granular representability under certain conditions. This paper investigates the granular representability of other models of fuzzy rough sets, specifically fuzzy quantifier-based fuzzy rough sets (FQFRS).

Proposed Solution:
The paper examines the granular representability of two main types of FQFRS:

1) Choquet integral based FQFRS: Includes OWA-based FRS and more general Choquet integral based models.

2) Sugeno integral based FQFRS 

It also briefly studies other FQFRS models like YWIC, YWIS, WOWAC, WOWAS.

Main Contributions:

- Proves that Choquet integral based FQFRS have granular representability under the same conditions as OWA-based FRS, i.e. when using D-convex left-continuous t-norms and residual implicators.

- Shows that Sugeno integral based FQFRS have granular representability under the same conditions as classical fuzzy rough sets, without needing D-convexity.

- Demonstrates through counterexamples that YWIC, YWIS, WOWAC and WOWAS models do not have granular representability in general. 

- Experiments on 20 real-world datasets indicate that inconsistencies in YWIC and WOWAC models are small in practice. Sugeno integral based YWIS has virtually no inconsistencies.

The results highlight the potential of Choquet and Sugeno integral based FQFRS for resolving inconsistencies and managing noise, while also revealing limitations of other FQFRS models in the context of rule induction.
