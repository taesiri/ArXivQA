# [Translating between SQL Dialects for Cloud Migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08375)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Companies are increasingly migrating databases from on-premise servers to the cloud. This involves converting the SQL dialect used on-premise to the dialect supported by the cloud provider.
- While conversion tools can handle most of the translation, they fail to fully convert all the SQL code. The remaining code must be manually converted by engineers. For large enterprises with huge databases, manually fixing even 1% of unconverted code is intractable. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper examines three potential solutions that do not rely on large training data, since real industry data cannot be shared publicly:
  1. Manually creating rules to fix common conversion errors. Downside is significant engineering effort required. 
  2. Using imitation learning to learn rules from a small number of examples provided by experts. Early results show ability to handle 80% of initial test errors.
  3. Leverage large language models like GPT-4 to generate fixes. Risk is potential hallucinations leading to invalid SQL. Requires verification methods.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies a crucial roadblock in enterprise migration of large SQL databases to the cloud related to automated conversion tools failing on portions of the code.
- Proposes and provides preliminary analysis on three potential solutions suited for low-data environments, including imitation learning and large language models.
- Brings attention to this underexplored problem which has major real-world impacts for companies aiming to shift their databases to the cloud.
- Lays groundwork and direction for future research by outlining unsolved challenges and early promising results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the industrial challenge of automatically converting complex SQL code segments that fail initial database migration tools in order to facilitate efficient enterprise migration to cloud databases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing the industrial challenge of automatically transforming SQL segments that state-of-the-art database conversion tools fail on during SQL database migration to the cloud. The paper proposes this as a crucial but understudied problem in industry that causes serious bottlenecks for cloud migrations. It outlines the difficulties in obtaining suitable data for developing solutions, and suggests three potential approaches for tackling the challenge: manual rule creation, imitation learning, and leveraging large language models. Specifically, the imitation learning approach is highlighted as showing promising preliminary results in learning conversion rules from just a few examples. Overall, the paper aims to bring attention to this important practical problem in industry and inspire further research and new solutions for it.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- Cloud migration
- SQL
- SQL dialects (e.g. MySQL, Postgres)  
- Database migration
- Code translation
- Machine translation
- Imitation learning
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Error handling
- Automation

The paper introduces the problem of automatically transforming SQL code segments that fail to be converted by standard database migration tools during a migration from an on-premise database to a cloud database. It frames this as a key challenge for industries performing cloud migrations and proposes potential solutions like imitation learning and leveraging large language models. So the key terms reflect this problem context around SQL, cloud databases, code translation/migration, and AI techniques for handling errors and automation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper for translating between SQL dialects:

1. The paper proposes imitation learning as one potential approach. How might the system architecture for an imitation learning-based solution differ from traditional rule-based SQL translation systems? What are some key components it would need?

2. When using imitation learning, what strategies could help verify that the learned translation rules generalize well and avoid overfitting to the few examples provided? How important is the diversity and coverage of the examples?

3. For the imitation learning approach, what encoding of the SQL statements and error messages would be most suitable as input? Should syntax trees be used? What tradeoffs are there between syntactic and semantic representations?

4. When applying large language models like GPT-4, the paper notes they can sometimes hallucinate content. What verification methods could help detect such hallucinations when translating SQL statements? What types of hallucinations would be most problematic?

5. Could techniques like finetuning on domain-specific data help adapt large language models better for the SQL translation task? What data would be needed and how could it be obtained at scale?

6. The paper suggests combining large language models with verification of outputs. What existing verification techniques from programming languages could transfer to SQL? What limitations might arise?

7. Rule-based methods require extensive SQL expertise to create translation rules manually. Could any intermediate representations or tools help non-experts contribute rules more easily? What abstractions over SQL might help?

8. What types of conversion errors are most challenging for the proposed techniques? When would it be better to flag for manual translation instead? How could the approaches complement developer time?

9. How suitable are the proposed data-driven techniques for translating longer SQL procedures and functions, rather than single statements? What challenges arise at that scale?

10. How could the suggested techniques be evaluated systematically on this problem? What proxy tasks or data could approximate the true translation challenge well? How important is real-world SQL data?
