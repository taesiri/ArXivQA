# [Using Fiber Optic Bundles to Miniaturize Vision-Based Tactile Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-based tactile sensors can achieve high spatial resolution and low cost, but existing designs have large form factors due to constraints from the internal optics and electronics. This makes them difficult to integrate into small robot fingers needed for dexterous manipulation in constrained spaces.
- One application requiring small tactile fingers is medical palpation procedures like digital rectal exams, where a doctor inserts a finger to palpate internal tissues. Current vision-based sensors are too large for this.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use optical fiber bundles as conduits to relay illumination and images from a small, finger-sized tactile sensor tip to remotely located optics, electronics and computing. This allows miniaturization down to average human finger size while retaining high resolution.

- Design considerations are presented for integrating coherent imaging fibers, incoherent illumination fibers and custom optics into a 15mm diameter package with a hemispherical, transparent elastomer tip.

- A proof-of-concept prototype called DIGIT Pinki is developed and evaluated. It has 0.22mm spatial resolution and can measure normal/shear forces with 5mN resolution.

Contributions:

- Demonstration of using fiber bundles for remote actuation and sensing to miniaturize vision-based tactile sensors to 15mm, smaller than a human fingertip.

- Design and testing of custom optics tailored for high FOV fiber-based imaging of a hemispherical gel.

- Force sensing experiments showing the sensor can accurately measure light forces for fine manipulation.

- Tissue hardness classification experiments demonstrating ability to distinguish stiffness levels relevant for medical palpation procedures.

- Case studies palpating phantom prostates and ex-vivo tissue to illustrate potential for digital rectal exams.

In summary, the key innovation is using fiber bundles to enable miniaturization of high-res vision-based tactile sensors, with one application being small fingers for medical palpation in confined spaces matching human dexterity.
