# [SportsMetrics: Blending Text and Numerical Data to Understand   Information Fusion in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper identifies the key challenge that large language models (LLMs) face in effectively integrating and reasoning over a combination of unstructured text and structured numerical data. This capability is crucial for many real-world applications, such as analyzing patient health records or product catalogs. However, blending textual and numerical data poses significant difficulties for LLMs related to processing entities and numbers, handling data inconsistencies, and aggregating statistics.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new benchmark called \texttt{SportsMetrics} to assess the numerical reasoning and information fusion capabilities of LLMs. \texttt{SportsMetrics} provides detailed play-by-play descriptions of sports games and evaluates models on four novel tasks: (1) adapting scoring under new game rules, (2) handling lengthy game narratives, (3) managing scrambled play sequences, and (4) analyzing statistics from game summaries. The benchmark utilizes real NBA and NFL game data, which offer dynamic narratives that models cannot easily memorize.  

Key Contributions:
- Presents a new benchmark comprising adversarial sports game data to test LLMs on numerical reasoning and fusion
- Assesses model performance using expert-designed formulas for overall "Game Score" along with tracking key stats 
- Examines model robustness under changing conditions like altered game rules and scrambled play orders
- Requires LLMs to create a working memory in JSON format to fill in missing game statistics
- Conducts experiments on major LLMs to demonstrate state-of-the-art capabilities and limitations
- Highlights significant gaps between human and LLM abilities in aggregating statistics over long texts

In summary, the \texttt{SportsMetrics} benchmark pushes LLMs to blend information from detailed sports game descriptions to reason numerically and statistically. The paper demonstrates this capability remains a challenge for LLMs through extensive experiments.
