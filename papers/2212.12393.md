# [A-NeSI: A Scalable Approximate Method for Probabilistic Neurosymbolic   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12393)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to scale probabilistic neurosymbolic learning (PNL) methods to complex tasks using deep generative modeling. Specifically, the paper introduces a framework called Approximate Neurosymbolic Inference (A-NeSI) that uses neural networks to perform approximate inference for PNL. This allows A-NeSI to tackle combinatorially complex reasoning tasks that were previously intractable for exact PNL methods due to the exponential blowup. The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1) A-NeSI can learn to perform approximate inference for PNL without changing the underlying semantics, allowing it to scale to problems with exponential complexity.2) The neural networks for approximate inference can be trained using only data generated by the symbolic knowledge, without needing real training data. 3) A-NeSI allows generating symbolic explanations for predictions and satisfying logical constraints, providing interpretability and safety.4) A-NeSI can match the accuracy of exact PNL methods on small problems while dramatically improving the scalability.The experiments on Multi-digit MNISTAdd, Visual Sudoku, and Warcraft path planning aim to validate these hypotheses and demonstrate the capabilities of A-NeSI on combinatorially complex reasoning tasks. The scalability and performance of A-NeSI compared to prior PNL methods is the main result.In summary, the paper introduces approximate inference with A-NeSI as a way to scale up probabilistic neurosymbolic learning to complex tasks while retaining the benefits of symbolic reasoning like interpretability and verifiability. The central hypothesis is that this approach can match the accuracy of less scalable exact methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing Approximate Neurosymbolic Inference (A-NeSI), a new framework for combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning using probabilistic logic. A-NeSI allows for approximate inference, rather than exact inference, to improve the scalability of probabilistic neurosymbolic methods.2. Proposing scalable neural network architectures for inference that factorize the prediction problem to be linear rather than exponential in complexity. This includes a prediction model and an optional explanation model.3. Presenting a novel training algorithm and loss function for fitting the inference models using only data generated from background knowledge, without needing real training data. This allows training on combinatorially complex problems.4. Extending A-NeSI to provide explanations of predictions using the explanation model and to guarantee satisfaction of logical constraints at test time using a symbolic pruner. 5. Demonstrating through experiments on three tasks (Multi-digit MNISTAdd, Visual Sudoku, and Warcraft Path Planning) that A-NeSI scales to problems with exponential complexity. It solves instances with up to 15 digits for MNISTAdd and 9x9 grids for Sudoku/Warcraft, which is beyond what previous exact inference methods can handle.In summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing a scalable approximate framework for probabilistic neurosymbolic reasoning that retains the benefits like explainability while avoiding the exponential complexity limitations of exact inference methods. The experiments demonstrate this scalability on challenging combinatorial problems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces Approximate Neurosymbolic Inference (A-NeSI), a new framework for combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning. Here are a few key ways I see this paper comparing to related work:1. Scalability. A-NeSI focuses on improving the scalability of Probabilistic Neurosymbolic Learning (PNL) methods like DeepProbLog. Exact inference in PNL grows exponentially with problem complexity, limiting applications. A-NeSI uses neural networks to approximate inference in polynomial time, enabling large-scale problems. Experiments show A-NeSI solving tasks not possible for exact PNL.2. Gradient estimation. A-NeSI learns approximations for the gradients of the Weighted Model Counting problem to train neural networks for perception. This provides low-variance biased gradients, compared to unbiased but high-variance score function gradients common in combinatorial settings.3. Explainability. A-NeSI can produce symbolic explanations by learning jointly over world states and predictions. This matches other neurosymbolic methods like Semantic Loss in providing interpretability.4. Hard constraints. A-NeSI guarantees logical constraints are satisfied at test time using "symbolic pruning". Most neurosymbolic methods focus only on soft constraints via losses. Hard constraints are important for safety.5. Probabilistic semantics. By approximating PNL methods like DeepProbLog, A-NeSI maintains clean probabilistic semantics, unlike fuzzy logic approaches. This preserves logical equivalences.Overall, A-NeSI seems to push PNL methods significantly forward in scalability while maintaining benefits like probabilistic semantics, explainability, and support for hard constraints. The approximation techniques seem widely applicable in other neurosymbolic domains as well. The experiments convincingly demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Studying if the explanation model produces helpful explanations. The paper introduces an explainable variant of A-NeSI that includes an explanation model, but does not evaluate the quality of the explanations produced. Further work could assess the interpretability and faithfulness of the explanations.- Extensions to continuous random variables. The current A-NeSI framework is designed for discrete variables. The authors suggest extending it to handle continuous distributions as well, and point to prior work on gradient estimation for inspiration. - Extensions to unnormalized distributions like Markov Logic Networks. The weighted model counting framework assumes normalized distributions over worlds. Applying approximate inference methods like A-NeSI to unnormalized models like MLNs is an interesting direction.- Automated A-NeSI solutions for neurosymbolic programming languages. The authors suggest using ideas from probabilistic programming to create semi- or fully automated implementations of A-NeSI integrated into languages like DeepProbLog.- Studying properties of tasks that make inference model learning easy or hard. The paper discusses when A-NeSI may struggle, but formalizing notions of complexity and studying learnability is an open challenge.- Scaling A-NeSI to even larger problem sizes. Despite the gains shown on the experiments in the paper, the authors note inference model training time and size may increase with problem complexity. Continued research on efficient amortized inference is needed.In summary, the main suggestions are around expanding A-NeSI's applicability, integrating it into programming frameworks, formalizing its properties, and continuing to improve its scalability. The combination of neural networks and symbolic reasoning remains a rich area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces A-NeSI, a scalable approximate method for probabilistic neurosymbolic learning. Probabilistic neurosymbolic learning methods combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning, but generally use intractable exact inference. A-NeSI approximates the computationally expensive probabilistic inference using neural networks. It has a prediction network that estimates the output probabilities and an explanation network that finds the most likely symbolic representations of the data. These networks are trained using data sampled from the background knowledge. Experiments on multi-digit MNIST addition, Sudoku classification and path planning show that A-NeSI scales to problems several orders of magnitude more complex than previous methods while maintaining accuracy and providing symbolic explanations. The key benefit is replacing exponential-time probabilistic inference with polynomial-time neural network inference to achieve scalability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces Approximate Neurosymbolic Inference (A-NeSI), a new framework for combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning. The key idea is to use neural networks to perform approximate inference over probabilistic logic programs, allowing the system to scale to problems with an exponential search space. A-NeSI has two main components: a perception module that encodes the input as a belief over possible worlds, and an inference model that approximates probabilistic queries over this belief. The inference model is trained using synthetically generated data from a prior distribution, avoiding the need for full groundings or enumerations. The authors evaluate A-NeSI on three challenging neurosymbolic tasks: multi-digit MNIST addition, visual Sudoku puzzle classification, and Warcraft path planning. Experiments demonstrate that A-NeSI scales almost linearly in problem complexity, solving tasks with up to 15 digits or a 30x30 grid while maintaining accuracy. A-NeSI is also extended to provide explanations and guarantee the satisfaction of hard constraints. Overall, this work combines the benefits of neurosymbolic methods with greater scalability through approximate probabilistic inference. Key strengths are the ability to train with synthetic data, provide explanations, ensure safety constraints, and avoid grounding exponential search spaces.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces Approximate Neurosymbolic Inference (A-NeSI), a new framework for Probabilistic Neurosymbolic Learning (PNL) that uses neural networks to perform approximate inference. The key idea is to use two neural networks: a prediction model and an explanation model. The prediction model approximates the weighted model counting (WMC) problem to predict the most likely output given a belief over possible worlds computed by a perception network. The explanation model computes the most likely world that explains the prediction. Both models are trained with data generated by sampling from a prior over beliefs and using background knowledge to compute outputs for those beliefs. This allows training the models without real data. At test time, A-NeSI uses the perception and prediction networks to make scalable yet accurate predictions. The explanation network can provide explanations. A-NeSI also allows incorporating symbolic constraints to guarantee outputs satisfy logical constraints.The main benefit of A-NeSI is providing a polynomial time approximation to probabilistic logical inference problems that are otherwise exponential, allowing neurosymbolic methods to scale to more complex tasks. Experiments show A-NeSI solving problems with exponential scaling in the number of logical variables that existing exact inference methods cannot solve.
