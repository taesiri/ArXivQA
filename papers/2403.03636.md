# [SheetAgent: A Generalist Agent for Spreadsheet Reasoning and   Manipulation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03636)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spreadsheet manipulation is common in daily work, but automating complex real-world spreadsheet tasks is challenging. Tasks often require multi-step reasoning and handling ambiguous instructions.  
- Existing methods for automating spreadsheets using large language models (LLMs) have limitations:
  - Focus only on simple formatting/calculations, not reasoning-heavy tasks
  - Fail to handle dynamic changes in spreadsheets 
  - Have limited understanding of table semantics
- There is a lack of complex benchmarks to evaluate spreadsheet agents, with real-world challenges like long-horizon tasks and vague requirements.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new benchmark, SheetRM, with 201 complex manipulation tasks requiring reasoning. Features:
  - Reasoning-dependent manipulation 
  - Multiple manipulation categories and reasoning challenges
  - Long horizon tasks with multiple steps 
  - Automated step-by-step evaluation
- Propose SheetAgent, an LLM-based agent with 3 collaborative modules:
  - Planner: Generates Python code to manipulate spreadsheets. Interacts using a feedback loop.
  - Informer: Provides SQL queries to help Planner reason over changing spreadsheet contents.
  - Retriever: Retrieves code examples to help Planner correct errors.

Contributions:
- SheetRM benchmark with more realistic and challenging spreadsheet tasks for developing reasoning-capable agents
- SheetAgent framework combining reasoning and precise manipulation for complex spreadsheet tasks 
- Experiments show SheetAgent significantly outperforms baselines with over 20-30% higher pass rate on multiple benchmarks. More accurate manipulation and strong reasoning ability.
