# [PAS-SLAM: A Visual SLAM System for Planar Ambiguous Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing visual SLAM systems using planar features struggle to accurately localize and map in planar ambiguous scenes. These scenes contain many objects with planar surfaces that are similar to the planes they sit on (e.g. tables with objects). This causes issues with:

1. Inaccurate and unstable plane extraction, causing poor plane selection. 

2. Simplistic plane data association methods fail, causing inaccuracies.

3. Overall poor accuracy of mapping and camera localization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a visual SLAM system tailored for planar ambiguous scenes, containing:

1. Plane Processing: Extracts planes using PEAC algorithm. Combines semantic information and analyzes plane structure (extracts edges/vertices) to select high quality planes.

2. Data Association: Integrates comparisons of plane parameters, semantics, projection IoU (Intersection over Union) and non-parametric tests to robustly associate planes.

3. Multi-Constraint Optimization: Constructs factor graph to optimize camera poses using constraints from associated planes, points, semantics and plane structures.  

Main Contributions:

1. Incorporates semantic information into plane processing and extracts plane edge lines and vertices for tasks like plane selection, data association and pose optimization.

2. Proposes an integrated plane data association strategy combining multiple types of information to ensure accuracy in planar ambiguous scenes.  

3. Enhances mapping accuracy and camera localization over state-of-the-art methods in planar ambiguous scenes due to the precise plane processing, data association and optimization.
