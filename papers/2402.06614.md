# [The Complexity of Sequential Prediction in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem Studied: The paper studies the problem of learning to predict the next state of a discrete-time dynamical system when the underlying evolution function governing state transitions is unknown. Specifically, the learner interacts with the dynamical system over a sequence of time steps, makes predictions about the next state, observes the true next state revealed by the system, and suffers a 0-1 loss if its prediction was incorrect. The goal is to design learning algorithms with low regret, defined as the difference between the learner's cumulative mistakes and the mistakes of the best fixed evolution function in hindsight.  

Proposed Solution: The paper provides a comprehensive characterization of regret minimization both in the realizable setting, where the observed state sequence is consistent with some evolution function in the hypothesis class, as well as the agnostic setting. The key contributions are:

(i) Defining new combinatorial complexity measures - Evolution complexity and Evolution dimension - that precisely characterize the minimax expected mistakes in the realizable setting. 

(ii) Showing that every mistake rate (not just constant or linear rates) is achievable through an appropriate choice of the evolution class. The Branching dimension is introduced to characterize when constant mistake rates are possible.

(iii) Proving that the Littlestone dimension characterizes agnostic learnability under Markovian regret, thereby separating realizable and agnostic learnability.

(iv) Studying agnostic learnability under the more natural Flow regret and showing that realizable and agnostic learnability remain separated in general but are equivalent when projection sizes of the evolution class are uniformly bounded.

The paper provides constructive algorithms and lower bounds. It also makes connections to well-studied settings of multiclass classification and system identification. The introduced complexity measures and dimensions draw parallels to classical statistical learning theory.
