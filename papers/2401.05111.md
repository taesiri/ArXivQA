# [Noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis conditioned on   self-supervised speech-representation model with adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05111)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods that use speaker embeddings from self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models struggle with degraded speech quality when the reference speech contains noise. This limits their utility for personalization using real-world noisy recordings.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce adapters into the SSL model to make the embedding extraction more robust to noise, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of general speaker representations. Two types of adapters are used - bottleneck (BN) in transformers and CNN adapters in the CNN blocks.

- Jointly fine-tune the adapters and TTS model using noisy reference speech to optimize for TTS task. This ensures robust speaker embeddings suitable for TTS are learned.

- Additionally, use a speech enhancement (SE) module as a front-end to further reduce influence of noise on SSL model.

Main Contributions:

- First application of adapters to improve noise robustness of SSL-based zero-shot TTS. Allows tuning on noisy data without catastrophic forgetting.

- Show combination of BN and CNN adapters works best - exploits noise robustness of CNN features and benefits from adapters in both CNN and transformer parts of SSL model.

- Demonstrate joint fine-tuning of adapters and TTS model outperforms just using an off-the-shelf robust SSL model like WavLM, highlighting need to optimize embeddings for end TTS task.

- Evaluate with objective metrics and subjective listening tests. Proposed method maintains quality and similarity to target speaker even with noisy reference speech.

- Analysis shows adapters help SSL model generate representations closer to clean speech, explaining improved noise robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech method by introducing adapters into a self-supervised speech representation model and fine-tuning them jointly with a text-to-speech model using noisy speech data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) method based on self-supervised learning (SSL) speech representations. Specifically:

- They introduce adapters into the SSL model to adapt the embedding extractor to noisy conditions. By fine-tuning the adapters jointly with the TTS model on noisy speech, they obtain robust speaker embeddings while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

- They investigate using both transformer adapters and CNN adapters in the SSL model to improve robustness. 

- They show combining the proposed method with speech enhancement further improves performance in noisy conditions.

- Through objective and subjective evaluations, they demonstrate their proposed SSL-based zero-shot TTS method with adapters achieves higher noise robustness and speech quality compared to not using adapters.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach using adapters to improve the noise robustness of SSL-based zero-shot TTS.

The paper proposes a noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) method based on speaker embeddings extracted from a self-supervised learning (SSL) speech model. It introduces adapters into the SSL model to adapt it to noisy conditions while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Speech enhancement is also used to further reduce the influence of noise.

Key metrics evaluated include mel-cepstral distortion and subjective quality. The effectiveness of using adapters for both the transformer and CNN components of the SSL model is analyzed. Overall, the key focus is on achieving noise-robust zero-shot TTS using speaker embeddings from an SSL model adapted with adapters.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed method introduces adapters into the self-supervised learning (SSL) model. Why are adapters useful for improving noise robustness compared to simply fine-tuning the entire SSL model? What are the benefits and potential downsides?

2. The paper explores two types of adapters - bottleneck (BN) adapters in the transformers and CNN adapters in the CNN feature extractor. Why might both types be helpful for improving noise robustness? What might be the relative contributions of each?

3. The adapters are trained jointly with the text-to-speech (TTS) model using noisy speech examples. Why is joint training important? Why not train the adapters separately first? What is the effect of joint optimization? 

4. The method relies on a speech enhancement (SE) front-end before the SSL model. What role does the SE module play? How does it interact with and complement the proposed adapter approach? What are the limitations of relying solely on SE?

5. Objective metrics show clear improvements from using adapters, but gains are more modest for subjective naturalness ratings. Why might this be the case? What factors might limit perceived naturalness compared to objective measures?

6. Analysis shows smaller clean-noisy distances after fine-tuning with adapters. Explain how this metric captures noise robustness. Why might smaller distances correlate with better TTS performance? What are potential caveats?  

7. The adapters help avoid catastrophic forgetting of cleaner speech examples used to pre-train the SSL model. Explain this phenomenon. Why is it problematic? How do adapters mitigate this issue?

8. The method is validated on a Japanese multi-speaker dataset. How might effectiveness vary for other languages or very limited/impaired speech data? What adaptations may be necessary?

9. The adapters are shared between the acoustic and duration embeddings. What is the motivation for weight sharing? What are the potential disadvantages? Did the paper experimentally validate this choice?

10. The paper mentions applying the method to models like VITS and JETS. How do those models differ from FastSpeech2 used here? Why might adapters still be beneficial in those contexts? What new research questions might arise?
