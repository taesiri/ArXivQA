# [PointCert: Point Cloud Classification with Deterministic Certified   Robustness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01959)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How to design a framework that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classifier to be certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a framework called PointCert that can take any point cloud classifier and make it certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds. 

- PointCert provides deterministic robustness guarantees, meaning the robustness guarantees are always correct, unlike prior defenses that provide probabilistic guarantees which can be incorrect with some probability.

- The robustness guarantee provided by PointCert is that it predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is less than a threshold.

- The paper proves the robustness guarantee of PointCert is tight, meaning it's theoretically impossible to provide a larger robustness guarantee without making assumptions on the base classifier.

- The paper considers different application scenarios of PointCert and proposes methods to optimize its performance in those scenarios.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a framework like PointCert that can transform any point cloud classifier into one with deterministic certified robustness against adversarial point clouds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing PointCert, a framework that can transform any point cloud classifier into one with deterministic certified robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. PointCert works by dividing the input point cloud into disjoint sub-point clouds using a hash function, classifying each sub-point cloud with a base classifier, and taking a majority vote. 

2. Deriving a tight lower bound on the certified perturbation size (number of points that can be arbitrarily added/deleted/modified) such that PointCert is guaranteed to predict the same label. This is a deterministic guarantee, unlike prior probabilistic methods like randomized smoothing and PointGuard.

3. Designing methods to optimize the performance of PointCert in different application scenarios:

- Scenario I: Direct application with base classifier trained normally 
- Scenario II: Base classifier trained on sub-point clouds
- Scenario III: Adding a point completion network (PCN) before the base classifier

4. Extensive evaluation of PointCert on ModelNet and ScanObjectNN datasets, showing substantially higher certified accuracy than prior probabilistic defenses. PointCert also achieves the best performance when the base classifier is trained on sub-point clouds (Scenario II).

In summary, the key novelty is proposing the first defense with deterministic certified robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds, enabled by the technique of dividing the point cloud into disjoint sub-point clouds. The paper also explores different strategies to optimize the performance of PointCert.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PointCert, a framework that transforms an arbitrary point cloud classifier into one that is certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees, and designs methods to optimize PointCert's performance in different application scenarios.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of certifiable robustness for point cloud classification:

- It proposes PointCert, the first framework that provides deterministic certified robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. Previous defenses like randomized smoothing and PointGuard only provide probabilistic guarantees. So this represents a significant advance in achieving true certifiable robustness.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates PointCert on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets and shows it substantially outperforms prior defenses like randomized smoothing and PointGuard in terms of certified accuracy. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The paper considers practical deployment scenarios for PointCert and develops optimization methods for different settings. For example, when the customer only has black-box access to the base classifier, they propose using knowledge distillation to train a student model. This makes the framework more realistic and applicable. 

- The certified robustness analysis provides formal guarantees on the number of point additions/deletions/modifications that can be tolerated while maintaining correct classification. And it is proved that the derived bounds are tight. This level of theoretical analysis is lacking in previous empirical defenses.

- PointCert is model-agnostic and can work with any base point cloud classifier like PointNet or DGCNN. So it is broadly applicable and can build on future advances in base classifiers.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions by proposing the first defense with deterministic certified robustness for point clouds, extensively evaluating it, and developing optimizations for real-world usage. The formal analysis and demonstrated effectiveness help advance the state-of-the-art in this area.
