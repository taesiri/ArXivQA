# [PointCert: Point Cloud Classification with Deterministic Certified   Robustness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01959)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How to design a framework that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classifier to be certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a framework called PointCert that can take any point cloud classifier and make it certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds. 

- PointCert provides deterministic robustness guarantees, meaning the robustness guarantees are always correct, unlike prior defenses that provide probabilistic guarantees which can be incorrect with some probability.

- The robustness guarantee provided by PointCert is that it predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is less than a threshold.

- The paper proves the robustness guarantee of PointCert is tight, meaning it's theoretically impossible to provide a larger robustness guarantee without making assumptions on the base classifier.

- The paper considers different application scenarios of PointCert and proposes methods to optimize its performance in those scenarios.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a framework like PointCert that can transform any point cloud classifier into one with deterministic certified robustness against adversarial point clouds.
