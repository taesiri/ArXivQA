# [PointCert: Point Cloud Classification with Deterministic Certified   Robustness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01959)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How to design a framework that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classifier to be certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a framework called PointCert that can take any point cloud classifier and make it certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds. 

- PointCert provides deterministic robustness guarantees, meaning the robustness guarantees are always correct, unlike prior defenses that provide probabilistic guarantees which can be incorrect with some probability.

- The robustness guarantee provided by PointCert is that it predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is less than a threshold.

- The paper proves the robustness guarantee of PointCert is tight, meaning it's theoretically impossible to provide a larger robustness guarantee without making assumptions on the base classifier.

- The paper considers different application scenarios of PointCert and proposes methods to optimize its performance in those scenarios.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design a framework like PointCert that can transform any point cloud classifier into one with deterministic certified robustness against adversarial point clouds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing PointCert, a framework that can transform any point cloud classifier into one with deterministic certified robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. PointCert works by dividing the input point cloud into disjoint sub-point clouds using a hash function, classifying each sub-point cloud with a base classifier, and taking a majority vote. 

2. Deriving a tight lower bound on the certified perturbation size (number of points that can be arbitrarily added/deleted/modified) such that PointCert is guaranteed to predict the same label. This is a deterministic guarantee, unlike prior probabilistic methods like randomized smoothing and PointGuard.

3. Designing methods to optimize the performance of PointCert in different application scenarios:

- Scenario I: Direct application with base classifier trained normally 
- Scenario II: Base classifier trained on sub-point clouds
- Scenario III: Adding a point completion network (PCN) before the base classifier

4. Extensive evaluation of PointCert on ModelNet and ScanObjectNN datasets, showing substantially higher certified accuracy than prior probabilistic defenses. PointCert also achieves the best performance when the base classifier is trained on sub-point clouds (Scenario II).

In summary, the key novelty is proposing the first defense with deterministic certified robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds, enabled by the technique of dividing the point cloud into disjoint sub-point clouds. The paper also explores different strategies to optimize the performance of PointCert.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PointCert, a framework that transforms an arbitrary point cloud classifier into one that is certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees, and designs methods to optimize PointCert's performance in different application scenarios.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of certifiable robustness for point cloud classification:

- It proposes PointCert, the first framework that provides deterministic certified robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. Previous defenses like randomized smoothing and PointGuard only provide probabilistic guarantees. So this represents a significant advance in achieving true certifiable robustness.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates PointCert on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets and shows it substantially outperforms prior defenses like randomized smoothing and PointGuard in terms of certified accuracy. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The paper considers practical deployment scenarios for PointCert and develops optimization methods for different settings. For example, when the customer only has black-box access to the base classifier, they propose using knowledge distillation to train a student model. This makes the framework more realistic and applicable. 

- The certified robustness analysis provides formal guarantees on the number of point additions/deletions/modifications that can be tolerated while maintaining correct classification. And it is proved that the derived bounds are tight. This level of theoretical analysis is lacking in previous empirical defenses.

- PointCert is model-agnostic and can work with any base point cloud classifier like PointNet or DGCNN. So it is broadly applicable and can build on future advances in base classifiers.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions by proposing the first defense with deterministic certified robustness for point clouds, extensively evaluating it, and developing optimizations for real-world usage. The formal analysis and demonstrated effectiveness help advance the state-of-the-art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring/designing different hash functions to divide point clouds into sub-point clouds in order to further improve the robustness guarantees of PointCert. The authors mention that the selection of the hash function impacts the distribution of sub-point cloud sizes, which in turn affects the robustness of PointCert. Designing hash functions that produce sub-point clouds with more uniform sizes could potentially improve robustness.

- Generalizing PointCert to other domains beyond point cloud classification, such as graph classification/regression tasks. The core idea of dividing an input into groups and taking a majority vote could potentially apply to other structured data types.

- Developing adaptive attacks tailored to PointCert. The empirical attacks evaluated in the paper are adapted from existing attacks for undefended models. Designing attacks that specifically target the PointCert framework could reveal its limitations and help improve it.

- Applying PointCert to real-world applications like autonomous driving and studying its performance. Evaluating PointCert on real-world perturbed point clouds could demonstrate its practical usefulness.

- Improving the efficiency and scalability of PointCert for large point clouds. The inference time per point cloud is currently <0.5s but reducing it further could enable broader application.

- Extending PointCert to certify robustness against other perturbations like rotations, scaling, etc. The current work focuses on additions/deletions/modifications.

- Reducing the gap between PointCert's empirical and certified robustness. There is a gap between its empirical accuracy under attack and the certified lower bound accuracy. Reducing this gap could improve the tightness of the certified guarantees.

So in summary, the key directions are improving PointCert's robustness, generalizability, efficiency, and tightness of guarantees. Evaluating it on real applications and tailoring attacks to it are also important future steps suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PointCert, a framework that can transform any point cloud classifier into one that is certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees. PointCert divides a point cloud into multiple disjoint sub-point clouds using a hash function, predicts a label for each sub-point cloud using a base classifier, and takes a majority vote to get the overall label. The authors prove that PointCert guarantees the same predicted label when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is below a derived threshold. They consider three application scenarios: (1) direct use of a standard base classifier, (2) training the base classifier on sub-point clouds, (3) prepending a point completion network to the base classifier. Experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show PointCert substantially outperforms prior defenses with probabilistic guarantees. The paper proposes the first certified defense against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PointCert, a framework that can transform any point cloud classifier into one that is certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds. PointCert divides a point cloud into multiple disjoint sub-point clouds using a hash function. It then uses the base classifier to predict a label for each sub-point cloud and takes a majority vote among the predicted labels as the final prediction. The authors prove that PointCert certifiably predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is below a threshold. Moreover, they show the certified robustness guarantee provided by PointCert is tight.  

The paper also proposes methods to optimize PointCert's performance in three application scenarios. In Scenario I, the base classifier is trained normally and PointCert is directly applied. In Scenario II, the base classifier is trained on sub-point clouds to improve its accuracy on them. In Scenario III, a point completion network is prepended to the base classifier to improve its accuracy on sub-point clouds. Experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate PointCert substantially outperforms prior certified defenses with only probabilistic guarantees. The results also show optimizing PointCert for different application scenarios improves its certified robustness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called PointCert to transform an arbitrary point cloud classifier into one that is certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds. The key idea is to first divide the input point cloud into multiple disjoint sub-point clouds using a hash function. Then, the base classifier is used to predict a label for each non-empty sub-point cloud. The predicted label with the highest frequency among the sub-point clouds is output as the final prediction. The method can provide a deterministic certified robustness guarantee, meaning it is guaranteed to predict the same label for a point cloud when the number of added, deleted or modified points is below a derived threshold. The certified robustness guarantee is proven to be tight. The paper also proposes methods to optimize the performance of PointCert in different application scenarios, such as training the base classifier on sub-point clouds and prepending a point completion network.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is developing robust point cloud classifiers that are certifiably resistant to adversarial perturbations to the input point cloud. Specifically, it focuses on providing deterministic guarantees that a classifier will output the same label for a point cloud even if an adversary adds, deletes, or modifies a certain number of points. 

The main limitations of prior work that this paper tries to address are:

- Existing empirical defenses against adversarial point clouds do not provide any formal robustness guarantees, so they can often be broken by adaptive attacks. 

- Existing certified defenses based on randomized smoothing or PointGuard only provide probabilistic robustness guarantees, meaning they can output an incorrect certified robustness bound with some probability.

To overcome these issues, the paper proposes PointCert, a framework to transform any point cloud classifier into one that provides deterministic certified robustness guarantees against point perturbations. The key ideas are:

- Split the input point cloud into multiple disjoint subsets using hashing. This limits the influence of any perturbed points.

- Apply the base classifier to each subset and take a majority vote. 

- Derive a tight deterministic bound on the number of points an adversary can add/delete/modify before the prediction changes.

The paper also proposes methods to optimize PointCert's performance in different application scenarios. Overall, it aims to develop the first certified defense for point clouds with deterministic guarantees, outperforming prior probabilistic defenses.
