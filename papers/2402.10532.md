# [Properties and Challenges of LLM-Generated Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT can generate free-text explanations along with predictions, but properties of these explanations are not well understood. 
- Explanations may exhibit typical properties of human explanations from training data, including being incomplete, subjective, or providing rationale even for incorrect predictions.
- It's unclear if such properties help or hamper goals like model transparency, trust and knowledge discovery.

Method:
- Authors identify properties of human explanations like selectivity, subjectivity, illustrative elements and misleading explanations.
- They manually analyze 200 samples from GPT-4 outputs in Alpaca dataset across categories like math, coding, facts etc.
- Three annotators label whether explanations exhibit identified properties.

Key Findings:  
- Explanations show selectivity (61 samples) and illustrative elements (58 samples) more frequently.  
- Subjective (8 samples) and misleading (1 sample) explanations are less common.
- Distribution varies by category - math and coding tend to have more complete explanations.
- Properties pose tradeoffs for goals like safety, trust, troubleshooting and knowledge discovery.

Main Contributions:
- First analysis of properties of free-text explanations from a large language model
- Discussion of implications of observed properties for uses in human-AI interaction
- Framework to relate explanation properties to ethical goals like trust and knowledge discovery

Limitations:
- Specific to English, GPT-4 and Alpaca dataset prompts
- Small sample of explanations analyzed
- Self-reported explanations from annotators may not match real explanatory behavior

In summary, the paper provides a novel analysis of free-text rationales from LLMs, relating properties to human interaction goals and outlining positive and negative effects.
