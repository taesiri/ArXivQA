# [Coevolutionary Algorithm for Building Robust Decision Trees under   Minimax Regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09078)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm called CoEvoRDT for constructing robust decision trees that can handle noisy, high-dimensional data and are resistant to adversarial attacks. CoEvoRDT alternately evolves two populations - decision trees and adversarial data perturbations. By fostering competition between these two populations, CoEvoRDT guides the search towards optimal robust decision trees. A key innovation is the use of game theory and mixed Nash equilibrium to construct a diverse Hall of Fame which accelerates convergence. Experiments on 20 benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoEvoRDT matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods on adversarial accuracy and significantly outperforms them on the more comprehensive minimax regret metric. The flexibility to optimize different robustness criteria makes CoEvoRDT widely adaptable. Moreover, CoEvoRDT can integrate previous robust models like FPRDT into its initial population for further performance gains. Overall, CoEvoRDT is a highly promising new technique for building robust decision trees tailored to real-world applications.
