# [Coevolutionary Algorithm for Building Robust Decision Trees under   Minimax Regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09078)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm called CoEvoRDT for constructing robust decision trees that can handle noisy, high-dimensional data and are resistant to adversarial attacks. CoEvoRDT alternately evolves two populations - decision trees and adversarial data perturbations. By fostering competition between these two populations, CoEvoRDT guides the search towards optimal robust decision trees. A key innovation is the use of game theory and mixed Nash equilibrium to construct a diverse Hall of Fame which accelerates convergence. Experiments on 20 benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoEvoRDT matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods on adversarial accuracy and significantly outperforms them on the more comprehensive minimax regret metric. The flexibility to optimize different robustness criteria makes CoEvoRDT widely adaptable. Moreover, CoEvoRDT can integrate previous robust models like FPRDT into its initial population for further performance gains. Overall, CoEvoRDT is a highly promising new technique for building robust decision trees tailored to real-world applications.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Decision trees (DTs) are a popular and interpretable machine learning model but are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of input data. 
- Existing defensive algorithms for creating robust DTs focus on optimizing adversarial accuracy, which has limitations. Other metrics like minimax regret better evaluate model robustness but cannot be directly optimized by these algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm called CoEvoRDT to construct robust DTs. 
- It maintains two populations - DTs and adversarial input perturbations. These populations evolve alternately, allowing them to adapt to each other.
- CoEvoRDT can freely incorporate different robustness metrics like minimax regret. Its flexibility allows optimizing for other objectives like fairness too.

Main Contributions:
- CoEvoRDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 13/20 datasets on adversarial accuracy and all datasets on minimax regret.
- It is the first algorithm that can directly optimize minimax regret for constructing robust DTs.
- It uses a game theoretic approach to construct the Hall of Fame with Mixed Nash Equilibrium which improves convergence.
- The output of other methods like FPRDT can be added to CoEvoRDT's initial population to further boost performance.
- It is adaptable to different target metrics owing to the flexibility of evolutionary methods.
- Strong experimental results and ability to choose custom error metrics makes CoEvoRDT useful for constructing robust DTs in real-world applications.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm that leverages interactions between DTs and perturbed data to create robust DTs optimized for chosen metrics. Its flexibility and strong performance make it a promising approach.
