# [Collaborative Synthesis of Patient Records through Multi-Visit Health   State Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) are crucial for healthcare AI applications, but their usage is limited by privacy concerns. Synthetic EHR generation is an alternative, but existing methods have limitations:
1) They don't model logical associations between different medical event types like symptoms, diagnoses, medications. 
2) They don't effectively utilize previous patient records for coherent synthesis of current/future records.  
3) They only generate event labels which limits applicability.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose the Multi-visit health Status Inference model for Collaborative EHR synthesis (MSIC) to address these limitations.

1) A probabilistic graphical model is constructed to capture correlations between event types using a patient health state variable. Symptoms and diagnoses determine health state distribution. Health state then guides medication prescription and future symptoms/diagnoses.

2) The graphical model and health state inference are generalized to multi-visit scenario to enable using previous records for coherent longitudinal synthesis. 

3) Beyond event labels, full medical reports are generated to detail each visit using multiple aligned paragraph generators and a collaborative multi-generator framework with two-phase decoding.

Main Contributions:

- Graphical model with latent health state to connect associations between different medical event types

- Multi-visit health state inference method to effectively utilize previous records for coherent current/future EHR synthesis

- Generate full medical reports to detail discrete event labels using a multi-generator deliberation framework and two-phase decoding strategy to improve collaboration.

The proposed MSIC model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in EHR synthesis quality while maintaining privacy. The generated medical reports also showcase enhanced alignment between events and textual descriptions.
