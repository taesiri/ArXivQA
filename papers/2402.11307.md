# [ICHPro: Intracerebral Hemorrhage Prognosis Classification Via   Joint-attention Fusion-based 3d Cross-modal Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11307)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) has an extremely high mortality rate of over 40%. Accurate prognosis prediction is crucial to develop appropriate treatment plans. 
- However, existing methods relying solely on CT image features are inadequate due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of ICH prognosis. 
- Despite the capacity of cross-modal networks to fuse additional information beyond images, the effective combination of different modal features remains a challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a joint-attention fusion-based 3D cross-modal network called ICHPro that simulates neurosurgeons' process of interpreting ICH prognosis.
- ICHPro fuses features from CT images with demographic and clinical textual data using a novel joint-attention fusion module.
- A joint loss function called VTMF loss is introduced to enhance the representation of cross-modal features.

Key Contributions:
- Incorporates 3D structure to extract more spatial texture features of hemorrhage locations from CT images.
- Fuses CT images with comprehensive demographic and clinical textual data to enhance understanding. 
- Employs joint-attention mechanism to adjust attention regions and acquire richer fusion features.
- Designs VTMF loss to promote better feature representations across modalities.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance of 89.11% accuracy and 0.9429 AUC on a real-world ICH dataset, demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel deep cross-modal network ICHPro with joint attention and loss to effectively fuse CT images and textual data for accurate ICH prognosis prediction. The method simulates neurosurgeons' workflow and sets new state-of-the-art results on a real dataset.
