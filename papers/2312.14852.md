# [TACO: Topics in Algorithmic COde generation dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing code generation datasets and benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate models' real-world programming capabilities. Issues include: low difficulty of evaluation tasks, test set quality concerns, and a lack of fine-grained skill indicators to precisely assess coding abilities. More challenging, higher quality, and finely labeled datasets are needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose TACO, a large-scale code generation dataset focused on algorithmic topics to provide a more challenging benchmark. Key aspects:

- Includes 25,433 training and 1,000 test coding problems from competitive programming contests to enhance problem understanding and reasoning.

- Contains over 1.5 million diverse, verified solutions. 

- Provides fine-grained labels (task topics, algorithms, skills, difficulty levels) for precise assessment of model capabilities.

- Rigorously processed including code deduplication, conversion, and test case supplementation.

Main Contributions:

- Constructs a large-scale, challenging algorithm-focused code dataset for more meaningful model evaluation.

- Provides comprehensive skill labels to enable targeted assessment of code generation abilities (e.g. dynamic programming).  

- Offers multi-dimensional annotations for tailored analysis (theme, algorithm type, skill, difficulty).

- Highlights models' deficiencies on complex coding problems and potential for skill-specific fine-tuning.

- Enables applications in code comprehension, recommendations, education by connecting problems to algorithms.

The dataset advances code generation research by addressing key limitations of existing resources. By systematically linking programming challenges to algorithms, TACO supports more nuanced analysis of model capabilities.
