# [DramaQA: Character-Centered Video Story Understanding with Hierarchical   QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that constructing a video question answering dataset with hierarchical question-answer pairs and character-centered annotations can enable more comprehensive video story understanding and evaluation of AI models. Specifically, the paper proposes:1. Hierarchical QA pairs based on cognitive development stages as an evaluation metric for video story understanding. The QA pairs have 4 levels of difficulty based on memory capacity and logical complexity.2. Character-centered video annotations such as visual bounding boxes, behaviors, emotions, and coreference-resolved scripts to model local coherence and provide a consistent view of characters. 3. A multi-level context matching model that utilizes the character-centered annotations to hierarchically understand correlations between video clips, QA pairs, and characters.The key hypothesis is that the hierarchical QA metric and character-centered annotations will lead to better video QA models and metrics that align with human video story understanding. The paper introduces the DramaQA dataset implementing this approach and provides both quantitative experiments and qualitative examples to demonstrate the utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is:1. Proposing a new video question answering (Video QA) dataset called DramaQA with the following key features:- Hierarchical QA difficulty levels as an evaluation metric based on cognitive development stages. This allows measuring the video understanding capability more comprehensively.- Character-centered video annotations such as bounding boxes, behaviors, emotions of main characters, and coreference resolved scripts. This helps to model the story coherence. 2. A Multi-level Context Matching model that hierarchically understands character-centered video representations to answer questions about the videos.3. Quantitative experiments showing the proposed model's performance on DramaQA using the hierarchical QA difficulty levels. 4. A new perspective on video story understanding research through the use of hierarchical QAs and character-centered annotations.In summary, the key contribution is the DramaQA dataset with hierarchical QAs and character-centered annotations, along with a Multi-level Context Matching model designed for this dataset. The aim is to enable more comprehensive video story understanding and provide a new direction for research.
