# [MLIC: Multi-Reference Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07273)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we design an entropy model that more effectively captures correlations in the latent representation across multiple dimensions (channel, local spatial, global spatial) to improve the rate-distortion performance of learned image compression?

The key hypothesis is that by capturing correlations in these multiple dimensions jointly in a single entropy model, rather than independently, they can achieve better compression performance. 

Specifically, the paper proposes multi-reference entropy models (MEM and MEM+) that incorporate:

- Channel-wise context module: Captures correlations between channels by conditioning each slice of the latent representation on previously decoded slices.

- Local spatial context module: Captures local spatial correlations using an enhanced checkerboard pattern context model. They propose two techniques to improve on standard checkerboard. 

- Global spatial context module: Captures global spatial correlations both within and across slices using attention mechanisms.

They hypothesize that by combining all of these context models together into a single multi-reference framework, the entropy model will be able to more accurately estimate conditional probabilities and achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance. The extensive experiments demonstrate the gains of their proposed MEM/MEM+ models.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling correlations across channel, local spatial, and global spatial dimensions jointly in a multi-reference entropy model will improve compression efficiency. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed MEM/MEM+ models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing the Multi-Reference Entropy Models (MEM and MEM+) that effectively capture channel-wise, local spatial, and global spatial correlations in the latent representation for image compression. 

- The MEM and MEM+ models combine channel-wise contexts, local spatial contexts, global spatial contexts within the same entropy model. This allows capturing more types of correlations compared to prior works.

- To capture local spatial contexts, the paper proposes two enhanced checkerboard context capturing techniques - stacked checkerboard contexts and checkerboard attention. These avoid performance degradation of vanilla checkerboard while retaining two-pass decoding.

- For global spatial contexts, the paper proposes an intra-slice and inter-slice global context modeling, where attention maps from decoded slices are used to predict global correlations in current slices. 

- Based on MEM and MEM+, the paper develops the MLIC and MLIC+ image compression models. Extensive experiments show they achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, reducing BD-rate significantly compared to prior arts and traditional codecs like VTM and VVC.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the multi-reference entropy models to capture multi-dimensional contexts, and developing high performance learned image compression methods MLIC and MLIC+ based on this. The enhanced techniques for checkerboard context modeling and global context modeling are also important contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes multi-reference entropy models MEM and MEM+ that capture channel-wise, local spatial, and global spatial correlations in the latent representation for learned image compression, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on multi-reference entropy models for learned image compression compares to other related research:

- Most prior learned image compression methods focus on capturing correlations in just one dimension, like spatially or across channels. This paper proposes modeling correlations across multiple dimensions - spatially, both locally and globally, and across channels. Capturing these multi-dimensional correlations is novel.

- For local spatial contexts, the paper explores enhancing the commonly used checkerboard context model to avoid performance degradation. The proposed stacked checkerboard and checkerboard attention modules are new techniques aimed at improving local context modeling.

- Modeling global spatial contexts by using the attention map from a previously decoded slice to guide correlations in the current slice is a novel approach introduced in this work. Prior arts either did not consider global contexts or required sending extra information.

- Combining channel, local and global spatial context models within an entropy model has not been explored before. Most works look at these contexts separately. Jointly modeling them is a key contribution.

- The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art compression performance, demonstrating over 8-11% bit-rate savings compared to standard video compression methods like VVC. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed multi-reference context modeling approach.

In summary, the key novelty of this work is in modeling correlations across multiple dimensions jointly using channels, local and global spatial contexts. The techniques introduced for enhancing checkerboard patterns and for global context modeling are new, and significant compression gains are demonstrated. This is an important advance over prior arts in learned image compression.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more efficient and lightweight versions of the proposed models (MLIC and MLIC+) so they can be deployed on mobile devices. The current models have high computational complexity due to the intra-slice and inter-slice global context modules. Methods like knowledge distillation, network pruning, and structural re-parameterization could help address this.

- Further improving progressive decoding with the proposed models. The paper notes that progressive decoding performance with MLIC and MLIC+ is unstable and can sometimes lead to artifacts. More work is needed on optimizing information flow between slices to stabilize and enhance progressive decoding. 

- Exploring other backbone architectures beyond the simplified Cheng et al. model used in this work. The global and local context modeling approach could be integrated into other state-of-the-art backbones.

- Developing more efficient attention mechanisms for the global context modeling. The quadratic complexity of the current attention approach poses scaling challenges. Approximation methods like sparse attention could help.

- Applying the multi-reference entropy modeling approach to other domains beyond image compression like video compression. The core ideas around capturing channel, spatial and global correlations can extend to other formats.

- Investigating the performance on higher resolution images to better understand the impact of cropped patches versus full images during training and inference.

So in summary, the key future directions are around improving efficiency, progressive decoding, exploring different backbone architectures, developing more efficient attention mechanisms, extending to other domains like video, and evaluating on higher resolution image data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Multi-Reference Entropy Models (MEM and MEM+) for learned image compression that effectively capture channel-wise, local spatial, and global spatial contexts in the latent representation. The models divide the latent representation into slices and use previously decoded slices as channel-wise context when decoding a slice. For local spatial context, the models use enhanced checkerboard context modeling techniques to avoid performance degradation while allowing two-pass decoding. For global spatial context, the models use the attention map from a previously decoded slice to predict global correlations in the current slice. Based on MEM and MEM+, the authors propose MLIC and MLIC+ models that achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing BD-rate by 8.05% and 11.39% respectively on the Kodak dataset compared to VTM-17.0. The key contributions are developing multi-reference entropy models that combine channel, local and global contexts, and demonstrating improved performance and rate-distortion tradeoffs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Learned image compression has recently achieved remarkable performance, with the entropy model playing a crucial role in boosting rate-distortion performance. However, most entropy models only capture correlations in one dimension, while latent representations contain channel-wise, local spatial, and global spatial correlations. To address this, the authors propose the Multi-Reference Entropy Model (MEM) and an enhanced version MEM+ to capture these multiple types of correlations in latent representations. Specifically, they divide the latent representation into slices and use previously decoded slices as channel-wise contexts when decoding a slice. For local contexts, they propose two enhanced checkerboard context modeling techniques to avoid performance degradation. To capture global spatial contexts, they compute the attention map of a previously decoded slice to predict correlations in the current slice, assuming spatial correlations are similar across slices. Based on MEM and MEM+, they develop image compression models MLIC and MLIC+ which achieve state-of-the-art performance. On the Kodak dataset, their models reduce BD-rate by 8.05% and 11.39% over VTM-17.0 when measured by PSNR.

In summary, this paper makes two key contributions. First, it proposes novel multi-reference entropy models (MEM and MEM+) that effectively capture channel-wise, local spatial, and global spatial correlations in latent representations. Second, it develops MLIC and MLIC+, new learned image compression models achieving state-of-the-art performance by leveraging MEM and MEM+. The results demonstrate the benefit of capturing multiple types of correlations, setting a new state-of-the-art for learned image compression.
