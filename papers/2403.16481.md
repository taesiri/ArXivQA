# [REFRAME: Reflective Surface Real-Time Rendering for Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- NeRF and its variants excel at novel view synthesis through volume rendering, but struggle with modeling reflective appearances and lack real-time rendering capabilities. 
- Existing real-time rendering methods, especially mesh-based ones, often have subpar performance in modeling surfaces with rich view-dependent effects.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose REFRAME, a mesh-based reflective surface real-time rendering method for mobile devices.
- Key idea is to leverage meshes for rendering acceleration while incorporating a novel approach to parameterize view-dependent information. 
- Decompose color into diffuse and specular components. Model specular color based on reflected direction using a neural environment map.
- Propose mesh geometry learner to robustly optimize vertex positions and normals, leading to good normal estimations for reflection direction calculation while maintaining low vertex/face numbers.
- Use an environment feature map during training to enhance capacity to reconstruct complex reflections without increasing inference burden. Map can be edited for relighting.

Main Contributions:
- Achieve real-time rendering on mobile devices with advantage in mesh efficiency compared to baselines, while reaching comparable or better reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods.
- Specifically show superior performance in rendering highly reflective objects.
- Effectively decouple scene properties like appearance, geometry and lighting to enable applications like relighting.
- Demonstrate real-time rendering across various platforms like smartphones while having low memory overhead.

In summary, the paper enables high-quality real-time rendering of reflective surfaces on resource-constrained mobile devices via a mesh representation and reflection-based rendering approach.
