# [A Dual-way Enhanced Framework from Text Matching Point of View for   Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11816)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal entity linking (MEL) methods suffer from two main issues: 1) modality impurity due to noise and irrelevant objects in images, and 2) ambiguous textual representation of entities using only their properties. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a dual-way enhanced (DWE) framework that enhances both the query (mention) using refined multimodal features and enriches entity representations using Wikipedia descriptions.

- For enhancing the query, DWE extracts visual characteristics like facial features and scene attributes from images. It aligns these with textual features of the mention via cross-modal enhancers and produces enhanced query representations.

- For entities, DWE uses detailed Wikipedia descriptions instead of just properties to obtain more distinctive textual representations.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates MEL as a neural text matching problem between enhanced mention representations and entity representations.

- Introduces fine-grained visual characteristics and cross-modal enhancers to refine and enhance multimodal query representations.

- Enriches textual entity representations using Wikipedia descriptions to reduce ambiguity.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art on three MEL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dual enhancements in DWE.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing both the query and entities in a dual way - refining multimodal query features and disambiguating entities using Wikipedia, leading to significant performance improvements.
