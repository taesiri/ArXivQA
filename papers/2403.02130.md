# [Using LLMs for the Extraction and Normalization of Product Attribute   Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02130)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- E-commerce websites need to extract and normalize product attribute values from unstructured text descriptions to enable features like faceted search and recommendations. 
- Existing methods rely on large labeled datasets or only extract values without normalization.
- Normalization (e.g. unit conversion, name expansion) is needed to represent values on comparable scales.
- Current benchmarks only measure extraction quality, not normalization.

Proposed Solution:
- Use large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for value extraction and normalization. 
- Introduce prompt templates to instruct models, with and without training data.
- Templates utilize example values and demonstrations for few-shot learning.

Contributions:
1) Prompt templates covering use cases with and without training data. 
2) Introduce new dataset WDC-PAVE with 1,420 product offers and 24k manually verified attribute values, prepared for extraction and normalization tasks.
3) Show GPT-4 outperforms PLLM baselines by 10% for extraction, achieving 91% F1 score.  
4) Demonstrate GPT-4 performance for normalization operations like name expansion (98% F1) and string wrangling (95% F1).
5) Identify challenges in operations requiring more reasoning like value generalization and unit conversion.

In summary, the paper explores using modern LLMs for product attribute value extraction and normalization, introduces new datasets and prompts benchmarking different use cases, and analyzes model performance across different normalization operations.
