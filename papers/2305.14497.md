The key hypothesis is that refining problems into a better formulation will improve the reasoning performance of language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Self-Polish (SP) to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. Specifically:- The key idea is to refine the given reasoning problems to make them easier for language models to comprehend and solve. This involves eliminating irrelevant information, rearranging logic, and reorganizing conditions. - The method teaches language models to progressively refine problems through demonstrations of problem rewriting. It leverages models' in-context learning ability to acquire these skills.- Self-Polish is orthogonal to other prompting methods like chain-of-thought or self-consistency, so it can be conveniently combined with them for further improvements.- Experiments show Self-Polish boosts reasoning performance across multiple models and datasets, especially on more challenging tasks. It also improves robustness against irrelevant information.- The method provides a new direction of enhancing language models' reasoning skills by facilitating their processing of problems, rather than just optimizing the generation of rationales and answers.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Self-Polish, a novel prompting method to refine reasoning problems to make them more comprehensible for language models, consequently improving reasoning performance and robustness. The idea of refining problems is an underexplored way of enhancing language models' reasoning abilities.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of enhancing multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models:Overall Approach- This paper proposes a new method called Self-Polish (SP) that focuses on refining the given reasoning problems to make them more comprehensible and solvable for the model. This is a unique approach compared to most prior work that focuses on improving the generation of rationales or enhancing the consistency of answers.- The idea of reformulating problems/queries has been explored before in other domains like information retrieval and conversational QA. However, Self-Polish specifically targets multi-step reasoning and leverages the emergent skills of large language models to perform the refinement, rather than relying on training a separate model.Key Contributions:- Demonstrates the effectiveness of using large language models themselves to refine reasoning problems, without requiring fine-tuning.- Proposes a novel progressive framework to iteratively rephrase problems for higher reliability and consistency of generated problems. - Shows strong empirical results on multiple datasets and models, including state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.- Shows the approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought and can bring further improvements when combined.Limitations:- Still relies heavily on manually constructed demonstrations for teaching the problem refinement skills. More work is needed towards automating this process.- Evaluated mostly on mathematical reasoning problems. Testing on more varieties of complex reasoning is needed.- Hyperparameters like number of rephrasing iterations and selection strategies for final answer still need more analysis for real-world deployment.Overall, the core ideas of leveraging model's own skills for problem reformulation and the progressive rephrasing framework are novel contributions not explored by prior work. The results demonstrate promising potential, but more research is needed towards making the approach more generalizable and automated.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring automated methods for generating effective problem-refining prompts, rather than relying on manual construction. The authors mention this as an area for future work.- Evaluating the performance of Self-Polish when combined with other recently proposed prompting methods like Progressive-Hint Prompting. The authors suggest their method is orthogonal and could likely lead to further gains. - Applying Self-Polish to additional challenging reasoning tasks beyond the benchmarks studied in the paper. The authors frame their work as an important step towards enhancing reasoning in LLMs in general.- Leveraging Self-Polish as pre-training rather than just a test-time technique. The authors suggest it could potentially teach models to better handle low-quality problems.- Exploring integration of Self-Polish with retrieval-augmented methods like REALM to provide additional context. The authors suggest retrieval could further aid problem comprehension.- Developing automated metrics to assess the quality and coherence of generated problems after refinement. This could help further improve the approach.- Experimenting with different constraints and objectives during problem generation, like maximizing logic consistency.- Applying insights from Self-Polish to other language tasks like summarization that could benefit from problem reformulation.In summary, the main future directions are developing automated prompt engineering, integrating with other methods, generalizing to more tasks, using Self-Polish during pre-training, combining with retrieval, developing better evaluation metrics, and exploring variations on the refinement objectives. The authors frame Self-Polish as an important step towards optimizing problems to improve reasoning in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Self-Polish (SP) to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models when facing low-quality problems. SP facilitates the model's problem-solving process by prompting it to progressively refine the given problems into a more comprehensible and solvable formulation. Specifically, it teaches the model to eliminate irrelevant information, rearrange logic structure, and organize conditions into new ones in parallel. SP is orthogonal to other prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought, making it convenient to integrate for further improvement. Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks with models like Text-davinci-003 demonstrate SP's effectiveness. For example, it boosts the performance of standard few-shot prompting by 8.0% on GSM8K and 17.8% on MultiArith. When combined with Chain-of-Thought, SP also improves performance by 6.0% on GSM8K and MathQA. The proposed SP represents an important step towards enhancing reasoning in LLMs by facilitating their comprehension and processing of problems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel method called Self-Polish (SP) that improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by refining the given reasoning problems to make them more comprehensible and solvable. The key idea is to leverage the emergent abilities of LLMs like in-context learning and instruction following to teach the models to progressively rewrite problems in a better formulation. Specifically, the refinements eliminate irrelevant information, rearrange logic structure, and reorganize conditions into new ones in parallel. SP operates iteratively until the generated answer converges. The method is evaluated on five reasoning benchmarks with various LLMs. Results show that SP consistently improves the performance of standard few-shot prompting, with gains like 8.0% on GSM8K and 17.8% on MultiArith using Text-davinci-003. Moreover, SP can be conveniently combined with other prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought for further improvements. The robustness tests also demonstrate the effectiveness of SP in making models more reliable. In summary, SP represents an important advancement in enhancing reasoning abilities of LLMs by facilitating their comprehension and processing of problems. The proposed techniques for refining problems could motivate future research in this direction.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Self-Polish (SP) that improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models when faced with low-quality problems. SP operates by prompting the model to progressively refine the given problem into a more comprehensible and solvable formulation. It does this through demonstrations that teach the model to eliminate irrelevant information, rearrange logic structure, and reorganize conditions in parallel. The refined problems are then fed back into the model in an iterative process, until the answer converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached. SP can be easily combined with existing prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency for further gains. The main innovation is using the model's own capabilities to iteratively refine problems rather than just rationales or answers as in prior work. Experiments across models and datasets show SP consistently improves standard prompting, standalone or when integrated with other methods. The core idea is facilitating reasoning by refining problems to be logical, focused, and clear.
