# [Less is More: Pre-train a Strong Text Encoder for Dense Retrieval Using   a Weak Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09206)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to pre-train an autoencoder language model that provides good sentence representations for effective dense retrieval. The key hypothesis is that using a standard autoencoder setup with a strong decoder like GPT-2 does not necessarily produce good sentence representations for dense retrieval, because the strong decoder can exploit language patterns and bypass dependence on the encoder. To address this, the authors propose a new pre-training method called SEED-Encoder, which uses a weak decoder with restricted capacity and attention flexibility. This forces the encoder to provide better sentence representations in order to reconstruct the input. The authors hypothesize that pre-training the autoencoder this way will produce an encoder that gives higher quality sentence embeddings for dense retrieval tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that pre-training an autoencoder with a weak decoder will produce a better encoder for dense retrieval compared to standard pre-training methods like BERT or autoencoders with strong decoders. The paper aims to demonstrate this through theoretical analysis, experiments on retrieval tasks, and ablation studies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new self-supervised pre-training method called SEED-Encoder that trains an autoencoder with a weak decoder to produce better text representations for dense retrieval. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- They provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that a standard autoencoder with a strong decoder (like GPT-2) does not learn good text encodings for dense retrieval due to the decoder exploiting language patterns and bypassing dependency on the encoder.- They propose SEED-Encoder, which pairs a BERT-style encoder with a weak decoder that has restricted capacity and attention flexibility. This forces the encoder to provide better text representations that capture more contextual information.- They pre-train SEED-Encoder from scratch and show it significantly improves accuracy of downstream dense retrieval models on web search, news recommendation, and question answering without any architecture changes.- SEED-Encoder representations are shown to be more effective in few-shot learning settings with less fine-tuning data. This can help democratize benefits of pre-trained models.- Analysis shows SEED-Encoder learns more diverse and high-quality text encodings compared to standard autoencoders like Optimus. The weak decoder forces greater dependency on the encoder.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel pre-training strategy with a weak decoder to produce superior text encoders for dense retrieval compared to prior autoencoder pre-training approaches.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new autoencoder pre-training strategy called SEED-Encoder that aims to learn better text representations for dense retrieval. Here are some key points in comparing it to related work:- Most prior work on pre-training for dense retrieval focuses on modifying the model architecture or adding extra pre-training tasks. For example, DPR and ANCE use additional techniques like hard negatives mining during pre-training. ERNIE designs new pre-training tasks like predicting whether two segments are from the same document. - This paper takes a different approach by just modifying the autoencoder setup without changing model architecture or adding tasks. It shows that weakening the decoder helps create a better encoder for dense retrieval.- The weakness of autoencoder for dense retrieval is analyzed. The paper shows mathematically and empirically that a standard autoencoder with a strong autoregressive decoder may take shortcuts without relying on the encoder's representations.- Restricting the decoder's capacity and attention span forces it to depend more on the encoder's representation. This information bottleneck results in a stronger encoder despite using a weaker decoder.- Experiments across three real-world applications show the effectiveness of SEED-Encoder. It outperforms optimized baselines and requires less fine-tuning. The simplicity of the approach is also appealing.- The results demonstrate the importance of designing the right pre-training strategies, instead of just model architecture and sizes. It provides a new perspective to improve representation learning.In summary, this paper presents a simple yet effective pre-training technique for dense retrieval. It does not require model architecture changes or extra tasks. The information bottleneck approach is shown to learn stronger sequence embeddings that transfer well to downstream tasks. The analysis and experiments provide useful insights on representation learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions based on the work presented in this paper:1. Exploring more self-training tasks and network architectures for sequence matching in dense retrieval scenarios. The simple autoencoder framework with a weak decoder presented here is shown to be effective, but the authors note there may be other self-supervised approaches that could further improve text encoders for dense retrieval.2. Applying SEED-Encoder to other modalities beyond text, such as images, audio, etc. The idea of using a weak decoder to force better latent representations may generalize to other data types.3. Leveraging SEED-Encoder for other sequence matching tasks beyond the retrieval applications explored in this paper. The authors show it is effective for web search, news recommendation, and QA, but it may also be useful in other tasks relying on semantic text matching.4. Exploring whether the insights around weak decoders generalize to other self-supervised learning frameworks beyond autoencoders. For example, could a weak discriminator network force better representations in a generative adversarial network framework?5. Continuing to investigate connections between pre-training objectives and the generalization ability of models on downstream tasks. The authors argue a better designed self-training task can significantly impact downstream performance, suggesting further exploration of this relationship is valuable.In summary, the main future directions are exploring alternative self-supervised training frameworks, applying the approach to other data modalities and tasks, and further analysis of how pre-training objectives affect downstream generalization. The key insight around using weak auxiliary networks to force representations is identified as worthy of more exploration as well.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new self-training method for pre-training text encoders to be used in dense retrieval systems. Dense retrieval systems encode text sequences into vector representations and use similarity metrics to match queries and documents in the embedding space. The authors argue that standard autoencoder language models, which reconstruct the input text from the encoder's representation, may not generate high quality sequence embeddings. They show mathematically and empirically that the autoencoder can exploit natural language patterns and bypass dependence on the encoder, especially when the input sequences are long and the decoder is powerful. To address this issue, the authors propose a pre-training framework called SEED-Encoder that uses a weak decoder with restricted capacity and limited context. By limiting the decoder, they enforce a tighter information bottleneck that relies more heavily on the encoder's representation. They pre-train SEED-Encoder on web texts and evaluate it on passage ranking, document ranking, news recommendation, and question answering retrieval tasks. Experiments show SEED-Encoder significantly outperforms strong baselines including BERT, Optimus, and task-specific architectures. The general framework demonstrates the importance of designing proper self-supervision tasks, beyond just model architecture, for learning transferable representations.
