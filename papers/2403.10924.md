# [PAAMP: Polytopic Action-Set And Motion Planning For Long Horizon Dynamic   Motion Planning via Mixed Integer Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10924)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Long-horizon, dynamically feasible motion planning problems in robotics involve challenging non-convex and discontinuous optimization. Traditional methods like direct transcription struggle with the nonlinear nature of these problems.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce the concept of "Polytopic Action Sets" - learned representations of feasible trajectory sets over a fixed horizon. 
- Show that by sequencing appropriate Polytopic Action Sets, the long-horizon planning problem can be transformed into a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP).
- Adapt principles from Multi-Modal Motion Planning to establish a Mode Adjacency Graph that enhances exploration of feasible sequences. 
- Develop volume-based heuristics to guide efficient searches for promising sequences.

Main Contributions:
- Present a methodology to simplify dynamic feasibility constraints to linear ones by limiting search to polytopes.
- Show the long-horizon planning problem can be formulated as a MILP using these Polytopic Action Sets.
- Apply concepts like Mode Adjacency Graphs from Multi-Modal Motion Planning to identify candidate sequences.
- Demonstrate improved computational efficiency in solving complex motion planning problems.

The key insight is to use Polytopic Action Sets to transform the complex nonlinear optimizations into more tractable MILP problems. Principles from Multi-Modal Motion Planning further enhance the search for feasible sequences. Together, this Polytopic Action-Set and Motion Planning (PAAMP) approach enables efficient solutions to challenging long-horizon planning tasks.
