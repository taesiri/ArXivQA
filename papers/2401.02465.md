# [Interpretable Time Series Models for Wastewater Modeling in Combined   Sewer Overflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Extreme rainfall events leading to Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) that spill wastewater into the environment are becoming more frequent due to climate change. This causes pollution and contamination of water bodies, posing risks for humans and aquatic life.

- There is a need for models that can accurately predict wastewater levels in rainwater collecting tanks to minimize CSO spills by proactively emptying tanks before they overflow.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use interpretable state-of-the-art time series (TS) models like Neural Harmonic Imitation Temporal Point Process (N-HiTS) and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) to predict future wastewater levels in tanks based on historical sensor data from a sewage system.

- Compare performance of models on a real-world dataset from Duisburg, Germany with 20 sensors and 5 rainwater tanks as well as the standard benchmark Bellinge dataset.

- Evaluate model robustness to simulated sensor failures.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrated feasibility and value of using modern TS models for wastewater level prediction. N-HiTS with Mean Average Scaled Error (MASE) loss achieved best performance on Duisburg data.

- Showed superior performance on Bellinge data (MAE 0.0035, RMSE 0.0047), proving applicability to other sewage systems.

- Visualized model interpretations to enhance engineer's trust and actions based on ML predictions.

- Identified challenge of robustness to sensor failures. With just one failed sensor cluster, errors increased 2-4 times.

- Highlighted the need for future research into specialized methods robust to real-world imperfections in sewage infrastructure monitoring.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the potential of interpretable time series models like N-HiTS and TFT to predict critical wastewater levels in sewer systems, in order to prevent environmental pollution from sewer overflows during heavy rainfall events.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Investigating the potential of recently developed state-of-the-art interpretable time series (TS) models to help predict critical water level points in wastewater systems, so that excess wastewater can be promptly redistributed across the sewage network to prevent environmental pollution from sewer overflows. 

Specifically, the paper tests two interpretable TS models - N-HiTS and TFT - on a dataset from Duisburg, Germany containing sensor data from a wastewater system. The results indicate that modern TS models can contribute to better waste water management and prevention of environmental pollution, while also providing interpretability to help water engineers understand the predictions.

So in summary, the main contribution is exploring these interpretable TS models for wastewater level prediction to help prevent sewer overflows and resulting environmental pollution.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using N-HiTS and TFT models from the PyTorch-Forecasting library. What are the key differences between these two models in terms of architecture and approach to time series forecasting? 

2. The paper evaluates the models using mean average error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) on a validation set. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using these metrics for this application? Are there any other evaluation metrics you would suggest?

3. The paper found that the N-HiTS model with MASE loss performs the best on the Duisburg dataset. What aspects of this model make it suitable for this wastewater level forecasting task compared to the other models? 

4. Sensor failure simulation is an important test for robustness. The paper simulates this by setting sensors values to 0. Can you suggest other ways to simulate real-world sensor failures?

5. The results show that shutting down a single sensor cluster increases errors significantly. Why do you think the model is sensitive to missing certain sensors? Does this indicate overfitting or some other issue?

6. The paper suggests the models could be used as components in a reinforcement learning system for automated sewer management. What would be the challenges in implementing such an end-to-end automated system?

7. N-HiTS and TFT provide some model interpretability. Do you think the explanations provided are sufficient for engineers to trust the model's wastewater level predictions? What additional explanations would be useful?

8. The paper used an encoder length of 48 hours and prediction horizon of 10 hours. What is the rationale behind selecting these values? How would changing them impact model performance?

9. Real-world sensor data can be noisy with anomalies. How can the data preprocessing be improved to handle issues like missing values, outliers etc.?

10. The paper experiments on 1 year of hourly data. Do you think the model can generalize well to future years? Should the training methodology be modified to ensure robustness to distribution shifts over time?
