# [ArthModel: Enhance Arithmetic Skills to Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18609)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called ArthModel to enhance the arithmetic problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA. It trains an auxiliary LLM (AuxLLM) to generate a postfix expression representing the arithmetic operation that a small specialized arithmetic model called ArthModel takes as input. ArthModel converts the postfix token embeddings into real numbers and math operations using native functions, performs the calculations, and converts the result back to text. This output is injected back into the original LLM via prompt engineering to generate the final response. Through staged training of the component models and mixed datasets covering both conversational and math questions, the overall LLM maintains its conversational abilities while incorporating ArthModel's math skills for arithmetic problems. Rather than training the LLM end-to-end, this cooperative framework allows compartmentalizing distinct skills into smaller specialized models. The method provides a way for LLMs to leverage external APIs and native functions on the inference platform.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes enhancing the arithmetic ability of large language models by training them to generate postfix expressions for arithmetic problems, feeding the expressions to a small pretrained arithmetic solver model, and injecting the result back into the language model via prompt tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method to enhance the arithmetic ability of large language models (LLMs) by having the LLM generate a postfix expression as a "code" input for a small pretrained arithmetic-solving model. The key ideas include:

- Training an AuxLLM model to generate a postfix expression for an arithmetic problem which determines the order of operations. This postfix expression is fed into the small arithmetic model.

- The small arithmetic model (ArthModel) converts the postfix expression tokens into real numbers and math operations using native function calls of the deep learning platform to calculate the result.

- Incorporating the output of the ArthModel into the main LLM via prompt injection to allow the LLM to generate the final arithmetic result. 

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating a way to combine a large pre-trained LLM with a small specialized arithmetic model to enhance the arithmetic capabilities of the LLM in a straightforward and effective way. The method allows leveraging the strengths of both types of models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a small pretrained arithmetic-solving model. What are some key considerations and challenges in designing and training this model? What techniques can be used to ensure it is accurate and efficient?

2. When generating the postfix expressions, what strategies can be used to handle more complex arithmetic expressions involving brackets, exponents, etc.? How can the model learn proper operator precedence? 

3. The prompt injection method feeds the output of the arithmetic model back into the language model. What are some ways this technique could be generalized for injecting other types of structured outputs? What are the limitations?

4. How suitable is this approach for handling more advanced mathematical expressions and equations beyond basic arithmetic? What adaptations would need to be made to the framework?

5. The framework relies on an auxiliary model to classify questions and produce postfix expressions. What alternative approaches could remove the need for this extra model while still leveraging a specialized arithmetic solver?

6. How well would this approach work for arithmetic word problems phrased in natural language compared to formulaic math problems? What extra training would be needed?

7. What other ways could specialized small models be incorporated to enhance other capabilities of large language models beyond arithmetic? What types of problems are best suited for this approach?

8. The model trains on synthetic arithmetic questions. How well would it transfer to real-world math questions? What types of unforeseen issues or edge cases might it struggle with?

9. For complex arithmetic expressions, efficiently searching the space of possible postfix expressions can be challenging. What search strategies and training methods could help address this?

10. The framework relies on native functions of the deep learning platform for calculation. Could models perform more reasoning by learning mathematical operations themselves rather than depending on native functions? What are the tradeoffs?
