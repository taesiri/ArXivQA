# [Word Boundary Information Isn't Useful for Encoder Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07923)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing transformer models like BERT use subword tokenization algorithms like WordPiece which encode whitespace/word boundaries using special symbols (e.g. ##, _). 
- These symbols lead to tokenizations less aligned with morphology, hurting performance on tasks with complex words.  
- Removing these symbols (giving WordPiece') improves morphological validity but it is unclear if the lost word boundary information is useful to models.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare WordPiece and WordPiece' on downstream tasks across 4 training scales.
- Introduce models that incorporate word boundary information into WordPiece' either explicitly (additional input embeddings) or implicitly (extra MLM prediction head).
- Evaluate on diverse tasks: GLUE (sentence classification), NER (token classification), Superbizarre & FLOTA (complex word classification).

Key Findings:
- WordPiece' gives better morphological tokenizations and improves performance over WordPiece on complex word tasks, especially at lower scales.
- Adding word boundary information explicitly or implicitly does not improve over WordPiece' substantially across tasks and scales.
- Suggests word boundary info is not useful to transformers and modifying tokenizers to remove it does not lose useful information.
- Performance gains of WordPiece' diminish at higher scales as model capacity increases.

Main Contributions:
- Shows removing word boundary symbols from tokenizers improves morphology without losing useful info
- Investigates multiple ways of incorporating word boundary info which does not improve transformers
- Evaluates impact extensively across models with 4 training scales and diverse downstream tasks


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Through an extensive experimental setup pretraining 29 models across four downstream tasks and three training scales, the authors find that incorporating explicit or implicit word boundary information does not lead to substantial performance improvements for transformer encoders, suggesting modifying tokenizers like WordPiece to remove space information does not result in the loss of useful information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

Through an extensive experimental setup that includes the pre-training of 29 models, the authors find no substantial improvements from their alternative approaches for incorporating word boundary information into transformer encoders, either explicitly or implicitly. This suggests that modifying tokenizers like WordPiece to remove word boundary information does not result in the loss of useful information, and the default masked language modeling task is sufficient for such models to pretrain effectively without needing this information. Overall, the paper shows that word boundary information is not particularly useful for transformer encoder models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- WordPiece tokenization
- WordPiece$'$ 
- Word boundary information
- Transformer encoders
- Morphological validity
- Pretraining objectives
- Downstream tasks
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- GLUE benchmark
- Complex word classification
- Training scales
- Explicit models
- Implicit models

The paper investigates whether incorporating word boundary information into transformer encoder models pretrained with a WordPiece-based tokenization improves performance on downstream tasks. It introduces WordPiece$'$, a modified version of WordPiece that removes word boundary markers. It also proposes explicit and implicit methods to incorporate word boundary information into models. The models are evaluated on tasks like NER, GLUE, and complex word classification across different training scales. The key finding is that adding word boundary information does not lead to significant gains, indicating it may not be useful for transformer encoders.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper compares WordPiece and WordPiece'. What are the key differences between these two tokenizers and what led the authors to create the WordPiece' variant? 

2) The paper evaluates the morphological validity of WordPiece' on several datasets. Can you explain the metrics used for this evaluation (token length, precision, F1 etc.) and summarize the improvements shown by WordPiece'?

3) The paper proposes several methods to incorporate explicit word boundary information into models using WordPiece', through additional tokens, embeddings with different indexing methods etc. Can you describe these different methods and compare their parameter efficiency?  

4) An implicit model is also proposed which predicts word boundaries through an additional MLM head. How is this setup different from the explicit models? What were the effects on the pretraining loss and accuracy?

5) The paper evaluates performance over a range of training scales. What are the key differences between the 4 scales (params, batches, data etc.) and how did choice of scale affect comparisons between WordPiece and WordPiece'?

6) Summarize the downstream task performance of WordPiece vs WordPiece' over the 4 training scales. On which tasks/scales does WordPieceâ€™ perform better and why might this be the case?  

7) For the proposed explicit and implicit models, how consistent were any performance improvements over tasks and training scales? What reasons might explain the mixed results shown?

8) Why might incorporating word boundary information through finetuning alone not lead to improvements? Relate this to findings on incorporating positional embeddings after pretraining.

9) What core conclusions does the paper make regarding usefulness of word boundary information for transformer encoders? How does this relate to default choice of architectures and objectives?

10) The paper compares models over a wide range of scales - how might results have compared if largest models possible were evaluated? What scope is there for future work investigating even bigger models?
