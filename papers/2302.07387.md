# [PolyFormer: Referring Image Segmentation as Sequential Polygon   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07387)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we formulate referring image segmentation (RIS) as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem to improve performance?The key points are:1. The paper proposes to represent the segmentation mask as a sequence of polygon vertices rather than predicting the dense pixel masks directly. 2. It introduces a new sequence-to-sequence model called PolyFormer to generate the polygon vertices sequentially.3. A regression-based decoder is designed to output continuous floating point coordinates directly without quantization errors.4. This allows the paper to unify RIS and referring expression comprehension (REC) tasks into one seq2seq framework by outputting both polygon vertices and bounding box coordinates.5. Experiments show this approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on major RIS and REC benchmarks by a significant margin.In summary, the central hypothesis is that formulating RIS as sequential polygon generation within a seq2seq framework can lead to better performance compared to existing methods. The paper provides substantial experiments to validate this hypothesis.
