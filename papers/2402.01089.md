# [No Free Prune: Information-Theoretic Barriers to Pruning at   Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01089)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the difficulty of pruning neural networks at initialization (before training) to find highly sparse yet accurate subnetworks ("lottery tickets"), which has been an open problem despite much research effort. Specifically, it aims to explain why methods that prune after training (e.g. iterative magnitude pruning) can find such lottery tickets but methods pruning at initialization generally cannot. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes that in addition to the number of parameters, the "effective parameter count" of a subnetwork should include the mutual information between its sparsity mask and the dataset. This means a mask found by pruning after training has higher effective parameters than one found by pruning at initialization, even at the same sparsity.

Main Contributions:

1) The paper states and proves a modification of the "Law of Robustness" where the usual parameter count is replaced by an effective parameter count including both number of parameters and the mutual information between the mask and dataset. 

2) It argues subnetworks found by pruning after training have high mutual information between their masks and the dataset, increasing their effective parameter count, while those found by pruning at initialization do not.

3) Experiments show pruning after training leads to subnetworks with higher capacity to fit noisy labels, supporting the claim their effective parameter count is higher. Tracking mutual information proxies over training provides further evidence.

4) The theory and experiments provide a possible explanation for why lottery tickets are hard to find by pruning before training - methods that do so produce truly sparse networks in effective parameter count, while the lottery tickets found after training are not as sparse as they seem when accounting for mask-dataset mutual information.

In summary, the paper introduces a tradeoff between parameters and information for determining the effective capacity of a sparse neural network, and leverages this tradeoff to explain the difficulty of pruning at initialization. The mutual information perspective provides a novel view on model capacity and Pruning in neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents information-theoretic barriers that help explain why finding extremely sparse yet trainable neural network subnetworks without training the original dense networks first has proven very difficult.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It states and proves a modified version of the Law of Robustness from Bubeck et al. (2021), where the parameter count is replaced with an "effective parameter count" that includes both the number of parameters and the mutual information between the sparsity mask and the data. This shows a new way in which information and parameters can be traded off.

2. It examines the consequences of this result for the tractability of pruning neural networks at initialization. In particular, it observes that subnetworks derived from pruning algorithms that train on the data (like lottery tickets) have high mutual information and thus high effective parameter counts, while those derived from pruning at initialization have low effective parameter counts. This may explain why it has been so difficult to find extremely sparse matching subnetworks by pruning at initialization.

3. It performs experiments on neural networks where approximations of the relevant mutual information quantities can be tracked during training. These experiments confirm that at the same sparsity level, subnetworks derived after training have higher capacity and expressivity than those derived from pruning at initialization, reflecting their higher effective parameter counts.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel perspective based on effective parameters that helps explain fundamental barriers to pruning neural networks at initialization, while also demonstrating empirically that information gained during training affects model capacity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, here are some of the key terms and concepts related to this work:

- Neural network pruning
- Lottery ticket hypothesis
- Pruning at initialization
- Mutual information
- Effective parameter count
- Smooth interpolation
- Overparameterization
- Generalization bounds
- Sparsity patterns
- Information-theoretic barriers

The paper discusses the difficulty of pruning neural networks at initialization to find highly sparse yet accurate "lottery ticket" subnetworks without training the full dense network. It introduces a notion of "effective parameter count" that incorporates both number of parameters and the mutual information between the sparsity pattern and dataset. The key ideas are that pruning methods using the dataset have higher effective parameter counts, and that overparameterization and smooth interpolation require high effective parameter counts. This provides an information-theoretic perspective on why pruning at initialization tends to struggle to match the performance of methods that leverage training data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the concept of "effective parameter count" $p_{eff}$ to account for both number of parameters and mutual information with the dataset. How exactly is this quantity defined and what are its key properties? How does it differ from standard parameter counts?

2. The modified Law of Robustness replaces the standard parameter count with $p_{eff}$. What is the intuition behind this substitution and why does it make sense theoretically? How does this relate to modern deep learning practices?

3. The paper argues that iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) may have high mutual information between the mask and dataset. What evidence or arguments support this claim? How could one experimentally verify or falsify this hypothesis?

4. Could you elaborate further on why IMP masks might have higher mutual information than those produced by pruning at initialization? What specifically happens during IMP training that allows this?

5. The paper suggests IMP trades off between parameter count and mutual information. How exactly does this trade-off manifest? Can you walk through the mathematical intuition in more detail?

6. How precisely do you define the memorization capacity experiments? What are the strengths and limitations of using this as a proxy for effective parameter counts? Are there better alternatives you considered?

7. You use correlation with label noise as a second proxy for mutual information. What are the connections between these two quantities? What are the relative merits of each approach?

8. Could the results be extended to structured pruning settings? What modifications would need to be made? Would the core arguments remain intact?

9. What are some of the key limitations of the theoretical results? When might the assumptions not hold in practice? Are there ways to relax them?

10. The paper focuses on computer vision. How might the results change for large language models trained in an online setting? What new analyses would be needed to study lottery tickets and pruning for LLMs?
