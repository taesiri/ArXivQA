# [Runtime Architecture and Task Plan Co-Adaptation for Autonomous Robots   with Metaplan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous robots operating in the real world need to handle uncertainties and adapt at runtime. Two key adaptations are:
1) Architecture adaptation: Activating/deactivating software components and changing parameters.
2) Task plan adaptation: Changing the task being performed. 

These two adaptations are mutually dependent and requiring coordinated "runtime architecture and task plan co-adaptation" (RATPA). However, existing solutions for RATPA are application-specific and not general/reusable.

Proposed Solution - Metaplan:
Metaplan is a planning-based approach for RATPA that combines:
1) Metacontrol - A knowledge-based framework for architecture self-adaptation. It uses a model of the system architecture to reason about when and how to adapt.
2) PDDL Planner - Used for simultaneous architecture and task planning. Ensures suitable configuration is selected for each task. 

By explicitly depending on architecture models (Metacontrol) and task models (PDDL), Metaplan is general and reusable across different robotic applications.

Main Contributions:
1) A reusable RATPA approach with minimal overhead
2) Demonstrated feasibility of approach by applying Metaplan to:
   - Simulated unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) for pipeline inspection
   - Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) scenario from literature

The UUV experiment showed Metaplan successfully adapting architecture (speed, search height) and task plan (search pipeline, follow pipeline, recharge) based on environment (water visibility) and system (battery level) uncertainties.

The UGV experiment demonstrated ease of re-using Metaplan for a different application by modifying the KB, domain and problem files as needed.

In summary, Metaplan enables general and reusable RATPA for autonomous robots to handle uncertainties. Key enablers are explicit dependence on architectural and task models.
