# [THÖR-MAGNI: A Large-scale Indoor Motion Capture Recording of Human   Movement and Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09285)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing datasets for human motion analysis and human-robot interaction (HRI) research lack comprehensive inclusion of exogenous factors and essential target agent cues. This limits the ability to holistically study human motion dynamics and develop robust models that capture the relationship between contextual cues and human behavior across diverse scenarios.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors present THÖR-MAGNI, a large-scale multi-modal dataset of accurate human and robot navigation and interaction in indoor contexts. The dataset extends the previous THÖR dataset with 3.5 times more motion data, new interactive scenarios, and rich contextual annotations.

Key Contributions:

- Includes broader set of contextual features (e.g. semantic zones, direction signs) and offers multiple variations (e.g. robot driving styles, interaction modes) to facilitate factor isolation, going beyond existing datasets

- Integrates diverse data modalities - walking trajectories, eye tracking data (8+ hours), 3D lidar scans, camera streams from mobile robot

- Comprises 5 scenarios designed to systematically vary factors like tasks, roles, robot behavior to study impact on human motion and interactions

- 40 participants take on roles requiring navigation, transporting objects, collaborating, responding to remote instructions over 3.5 hours across 5 days

- Provides tools to visualize multi-modal data and preprocess raw trajectories to enhance accessibility

- Dataset used to train activity-conditioned prediction models and study joint visual attention, demonstrating usefulness

- Addresses gap in available datasets to enable more holistic analysis of human motion dynamics and development of robust computational models.

In summary, THÖR-MAGNI offers an unprecedented resource through its volume, diversity and contextualization of natural human-robot interactions and navigation data toward advancing research in areas like prediction, planning, HRI and attention modeling.
