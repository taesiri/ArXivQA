# [A Survey of Table Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Table reasoning is an important NLP task where a model must answer questions based on information in tables. 
- Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become the mainstream method for table reasoning due to reduced annotation costs and improved performance.
- However, there is a lack of analysis summarizing table reasoning techniques for LLMs. Open questions remain about how to further improve LLM performance on table reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze mainstream techniques to improve LLM table reasoning performance, categorized into 5 types: supervised fine-tuning, result ensemble, in-context learning, instruction design, and step-by-step reasoning.
- Compare pre-LLM and LLM methods and analyze LLM advantages stemming from instruction following and step-by-step reasoning abilities.
- Propose future research directions to enhance table reasoning performance and expand practical applications.

Main Contributions:
- First survey analyzing table reasoning techniques for LLMs.
- Provide comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methods.
- Discuss inherent advantages of LLMs for table reasoning tasks.
- Outline promising future research avenues to advance the field.
- Summarize table reasoning resources to support further research.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the techniques and analysis provided in the solution, and the main contributions made by the paper in advancing research on table reasoning with large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper surveys research on table reasoning methods using large language models, analyzing mainstream techniques, why LLMs excel at this task, and potential future research directions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It summarizes the mainstream techniques used to improve table reasoning performance with large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into techniques following pre-LLMs (supervised fine-tuning and result ensemble) and techniques unique to LLMs (in-context learning, instruction design, and step-by-step reasoning). 

2. It analyzes why LLMs excel at table reasoning compared to pre-LLMs, attributing it to LLMs' instruction following ability benefiting structure understanding and step-by-step reasoning ability benefiting schema linking.

3. It explores potential future research directions to further improve table reasoning performance, including establishing diverse training data, sampling results more efficiently, automatically optimizing prompts, automatically refining modular decomposition, and mitigating error cascade. It also suggests directions to expand practical applications like multi-modal reasoning, agent cooperation, dialogue systems, and retrieval-augmented generation.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of table reasoning techniques in the LLM era, why LLMs outperform, and future directions to advance this field. The GitHub repository also helpfully summarizes table reasoning resources.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes the techniques for improving table reasoning with large language models into 5 types. Can you explain the key ideas and differences between supervised fine-tuning and result ensemble? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses?

2. The paper highlights that instruction design and step-by-step reasoning consistently improve performance across different table reasoning tasks. Why do you think these two techniques are so effective for large language models? Can you analyze the connections between them?  

3. For the in-context learning technique, the paper suggests future work on automatically generating and optimizing prompts based on the input questions and tables. What specific methods can be explored here? How can we leverage large language models to meta-learn prompt optimization strategies?

4. When using the instruction design technique, what are some ways we could automatically decompose a table reasoning task into modules based on the input question? What kind of modular architectures can handle a wide range of table tasks without human involvement?

5. The paper proposes mitigating error propagation for step-by-step reasoning by maintaining multiple possible intermediate steps like in Tree-of-Thought. How can we adapt this idea to a table reasoning context? What changes need to be made?

6. For supervised fine-tuning, the paper suggests constructing diverse training data across tasks to improve generalization. What guidelines and methodologies can we follow to create a balanced, multi-task table reasoning dataset? 

7. When ensemble techniques obtain multiple results, how can prompt engineering methods be used to generate results more likely to be correct? What prompt attributes should we modify?

8. For multi-modal table reasoning, what co-attention or dual encoder techniques can help align image table contents with textual questions? How can we leverage both modalities?

9. What kinds of tools and external interfaces could table reasoning agents leverage to enhance reasoning capabilities? How can we prompt large language models to correctly invoke and cooperate with these tools?

10. In a multi-turn table reasoning dialogue setting, how can conversation history and context be used to trace relevant table subsets as the focus changes? What memory mechanisms are needed?
