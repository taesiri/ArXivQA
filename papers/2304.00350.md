# When Crowd Meets Persona: Creating a Large-Scale Open-Domain Persona   Dialogue Corpus

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we create a large-scale, open-domain persona dialogue dataset in Korean that has natural conversations while guaranteeing the safety and satisfaction of crowdworker participants? The authors aim to create a high-quality open-domain persona dialogue dataset by having crowdworkers take on personas and converse with each other. However, collecting natural dialogue data from crowdworkers comes with challenges around privacy, safety, and worker satisfaction. So the authors develop guidelines, roles, and processes to overcome these challenges. Their overall goal is to show that their proposed strategy can produce a useful persona dialogue dataset at scale while providing a good experience for the crowdworkers.Specifically, some key aspects of their approach include:- Developing detailed conversation guidelines for persona and user participants to prevent harmful content while encouraging natural dialogue - Using a moderator role to manage crowdworkers, resolve conflicts, and support worker satisfaction- Allowing persona actors to use "artificial durations" in conversations to take breaks and continue dialogues naturally across time- Surveying participants after conversations to evaluate the process and worker experience- Analyzing the resulting dataset through topic clustering and dialogue generation to validate its quality and usesSo in summary, the central research question is how to construct a high-quality open-domain persona dialogue dataset at scale while ensuring it provides a safe and satisfactory experience for crowdworkers. The authors propose and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for creating a large-scale open-domain persona dialogue corpus in Korean. The key points are:- They propose a specific methodology for constructing a corpus of persona-based dialogues between crowdworkers acting as personas and users. This includes guidelines for personas, recruitment and training of personas, assignment of personas to users, conversation guidelines, use of artificial durations, reward systems, etc.- They conduct a pilot study to refine the methodology and conversation guidelines.- They recruit and train 11 persona actors and collect dialogues between the actors and users on a custom chat platform with monitoring. In total they collect 1,658 dialogues.- They validate the quality of the corpus by analyzing survey results, clustering word vectors to see diversity of topics, and testing few-shot dialogue generation.- They conduct interviews with personas, users, and the moderator to reflect on the methodology and identify challenges faced during corpus creation.- They frame this work around 3 research questions related to considerations for successful corpus construction, the role of the moderator, and whether their methodology achieves the intended goals.In summary, the key contribution is providing and evaluating a comprehensive methodology tailored for constructing a high-quality open-domain persona dialogue corpus involving crowdworkers. The paper provides useful insights and lessons learned for anyone looking to create similar large-scale dialogue datasets.
