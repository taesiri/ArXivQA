# [Defending Jailbreak Prompts via In-Context Adversarial Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to "jailbreak" attacks where maliciously crafted prompts can induce the models to generate harmful responses that violate safety constraints. Defending against such attacks is challenging without fine-tuning models or having sufficient jailbreak prompts for robustness. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a novel "In-Context Adversarial Game" (ICAG) approach based on adversarial learning to improve jailbreak defenses without fine-tuning LLMs. ICAG involves an iterative game between two LLM-based agents - an "attack agent" that generates new jailbreak prompts and a "defense agent" that crafts safety instructions to prevent harmful responses. Through repeated interactions, both agents' strategies evolve - attack prompts get increasingly refined while defense instructions become progressively robust.  

Key Contributions:
1) Pioneers applying in-context adversarial games to LLMs for jailbreak defense. The iterative game dynamically expands coverage of attack prompts and learned defenses over time.
2) First work using agent learning for automatic jailbreak exploration and mitigation without human input. Agents automatically extract insights to enhance attack and defense capabilities.  
3) Demonstrates effectiveness and transferability of ICAG defenses across multiple LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama-2, Vicuna through comprehensive experiments. ICAG consistently achieves lowest jailbreak success rates.

In summary, the paper puts forth a novel adversarial learning strategy to improve jailbreak defenses in LLMs without needing cumbersome fine-tuning. The approach fosters a continual arms race between attack and defense agents to learn robust safeguarding strategies that transfer across models.
