# [Characterisation of three-body loss in ${}^{166}$Er and optimised   production of large Bose-Einstein condensates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1245)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. To characterize three-body loss and identify any previously unknown loss features in ultracold 166Er gases at low magnetic fields (< 4 G). 

2. To use the knowledge gained about the loss landscape to optimize the production of large 166Er Bose-Einstein condensates.

In particular, the authors aim to map out the three-body loss coefficient (L3) as a function of magnetic field strength and temperature in order to uncover any resonant loss features that could impact experiments. This allows them to identify optimal parameters for evaporative cooling to produce BECs with the highest possible atom number. The detailed loss characterization also provides guidance for future studies of exotic many-body phases like dipolar droplets and supersolids in large 166Er samples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a detailed experimental study of three-body loss in an ultracold gas of erbium-166 atoms. The key findings and contributions are:

- They identify six new temperature-dependent three-body loss features/resonances below 4 Gauss magnetic field, in addition to three previously known resonances. 

- They characterize how the position and width of these new loss features depend on temperature. Both the peak position and width increase linearly with temperature. 

- They also study how the loss features are shifted by the light used for optical trapping, finding a significant effect when the polarization is parallel to the magnetic field.

- Using the understanding of the loss landscape gained, they optimize the production of large erbium BECs, obtaining condensates with over 200,000 atoms. 

- The detailed mapping of the three-body loss paves the way for future studies of large-atom-number dipolar gases and exotic many-body phases like dipolar droplets and supersolids. The loss coefficient measurements could also enable density measurements.

In summary, the key contribution is the careful experimental characterization of three-body loss resonances in erbium-166 and using this to enable improved Bose-Einstein condensate production, which will facilitate future studies of dipolar physics. The results also provide support for a "resonant trimer" model of the loss features.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from this paper:

The authors identified six new temperature-dependent three-body loss features in ultracold 166Er gases below 4 gauss magnetic field, allowing optimization of Bose-Einstein condensate production to over 200,000 atoms.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on ultracold erbium gases:

- This paper provides a detailed characterization of three-body loss features in 166Er across a range of magnetic fields up to 4 G. Previous work had identified only a few loss features in this field range, so this significantly expands our knowledge of the loss landscape. 

- The observations of strong temperature dependence of the loss feature positions and widths seems fairly unique among ultracold gas experiments. The authors connect this to theoretical models like the "resonant trimer" model, though more work is needed to fully understand the underlying physics.

- By optimizing their evaporation trajectory based on the mapped loss features, the authors are able to produce pure Er BECs with atom numbers over 200,000. This is among the largest BECs achieved in the erbium system.

- The motivation of this work is to enable future studies of exotic many-body physics in dipolar erbium gases. The large optimized BECs demonstrated here take a step toward having enough atoms to realize more complex dipolar phases.

- Compared to experiments on the similar dysprosium system, the characterization here provides more detailed mapping of the loss features. However, dysprosium experiments have realized dipolar droplet states with higher atom numbers so far.

Overall, this paper provides valuable new knowledge about three-body interactions in erbium that will inform ongoing work to unlock new dipolar quantum phases. The temperature dependence observations are unusual and merit more theoretical understanding. And the optimized BEC production should enable new experimental capabilities going forward.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Using the knowledge of the loss landscape to optimize atom number and minimize detrimental effects of three-body loss in experiments aiming to study dipolar physics. For example, this could enable the realization of more exotic dipolar phases like honeycomb, labyrinthine and pumpkin phases which require higher atom numbers.

- Precisely measuring the three-body loss coefficient as a function of density. This could provide a way to directly measure the density in quantum droplets and supersolids, which is crucial for determining their structure.

- Further theoretical and experimental study of the temperature-dependent loss features to better understand the underlying mechanisms. The authors note their observations are broadly consistent with a "resonant trimer" model but further work is needed. 

- Exploring Feshbach resonances and optimizing contact vs dipolar interaction strength as a function of magnetic field. This could uncover novel phases and dynamics arising from the interplay of short-range contact and long-range dipolar interactions.

- Using the optimized high atom number BECs as a starting point to realize 2D dipolar systems, which are predicted to exhibit more complex ordering phenomena like droplet arrays, labyrinthine phases, etc.

In summary, the main future outlook is using the detailed characterization of loss properties and optimized BEC production to study dipolar physics and exotic collective phenomena in higher dimensionality and with larger system sizes. The combination of tuning interactions and minimizing loss effects provides knobs for exploring the phase diagram of dipolar quantum matter.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies density-dependent atom loss in an ultracold gas of erbium-166 atoms below 4 gauss magnetic fields. The authors identify six previously unknown loss features that display a strong temperature dependence and sensitivity to the polarization/intensity of the trapping light. Specifically, the position and width of the loss peaks increase linearly with temperature from 0.5-15 microkelvin. This behavior is consistent with a "resonant trimer" model proposed previously to explain some loss features in lanthanide atoms. 

Using their detailed knowledge of the loss landscape, the authors optimize the production of large Bose-Einstein condensates with over 200,000 atoms. They use a three-stage evaporation sequence, carefully choosing magnetic fields to avoid losses. This optimized approach enables the highest atom numbers and points towards strategies to realize exotic many-body phases (like dipolar droplets) that require large samples. Overall, this work provides new insights into three-body losses in erbium gases and demonstrates how to mitigate losses to produce sizable quantum degenerate samples.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The authors studied density-dependent atom loss in an ultracold gas of erbium-166 for magnetic fields below 4 Gauss. They prepared spin-polarized samples in an optical dipole trap at various initial temperatures and measured the atom number and temperature as a function of hold time at a given magnetic field. By fitting the atom number decay to a model accounting for one-body loss and three-body recombination, they extracted the three-body loss coefficient L3 as a function of magnetic field. In addition to previously known resonances, they identified six new loss features displaying a temperature dependence in both position and width. To further study one of these features, they systematically varied the temperature and measured how the peak position and width changed. They also checked for light shifts by varying the intensity and polarization of the trapping light. Using this detailed characterization, they optimized the production of Bose-Einstein condensates by modulating the magnetic field, trap geometry, and density during evaporative cooling, ultimately producing condensates with over 200,000 atoms.
