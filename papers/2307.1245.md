# [Characterisation of three-body loss in ${}^{166}$Er and optimised   production of large Bose-Einstein condensates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1245)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. To characterize three-body loss and identify any previously unknown loss features in ultracold 166Er gases at low magnetic fields (< 4 G). 2. To use the knowledge gained about the loss landscape to optimize the production of large 166Er Bose-Einstein condensates.In particular, the authors aim to map out the three-body loss coefficient (L3) as a function of magnetic field strength and temperature in order to uncover any resonant loss features that could impact experiments. This allows them to identify optimal parameters for evaporative cooling to produce BECs with the highest possible atom number. The detailed loss characterization also provides guidance for future studies of exotic many-body phases like dipolar droplets and supersolids in large 166Er samples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a detailed experimental study of three-body loss in an ultracold gas of erbium-166 atoms. The key findings and contributions are:- They identify six new temperature-dependent three-body loss features/resonances below 4 Gauss magnetic field, in addition to three previously known resonances. - They characterize how the position and width of these new loss features depend on temperature. Both the peak position and width increase linearly with temperature. - They also study how the loss features are shifted by the light used for optical trapping, finding a significant effect when the polarization is parallel to the magnetic field.- Using the understanding of the loss landscape gained, they optimize the production of large erbium BECs, obtaining condensates with over 200,000 atoms. - The detailed mapping of the three-body loss paves the way for future studies of large-atom-number dipolar gases and exotic many-body phases like dipolar droplets and supersolids. The loss coefficient measurements could also enable density measurements.In summary, the key contribution is the careful experimental characterization of three-body loss resonances in erbium-166 and using this to enable improved Bose-Einstein condensate production, which will facilitate future studies of dipolar physics. The results also provide support for a "resonant trimer" model of the loss features.
