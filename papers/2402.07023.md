# [Gemini Goes to Med School: Exploring the Capabilities of Multimodal   Large Language Models on Medical Challenge Problems &amp; Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show promise for healthcare, but need rigorous evaluation to verify safety and effectiveness.  
- Critical open questions persist around LLMs' ability for expert-level medical comprehension and their risks of making unsafe errors.

Objectives:  
- Comprehensively evaluate Google's new multimodal LLM Gemini across medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and medical visual QA.
- Compare Gemini to state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4.  
- Analyze strengths, limitations, and risks if deployed in healthcare.

Methods:
- Evaluated Gemini on 3 medical benchmarks: MultiMedQA (reasoning), Med-HALT (hallucinations), Medical Visual QA (images).  
- Used advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, and ensemble refinement.
- Compared Gemini to MedPaLM 2, GPT-4, and other medical LLMs.

Key Findings:
- Gemini shows medical knowledge, but lags behind MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy.
- Highly prone to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps indicating risks.   
- Lower performance on visual QA (61.45%) than GPT-4V (88%), showing limitations in image analysis.

Contributions:  
- First comprehensive multi-benchmark evaluation of a multimodal medical LLM
- In-depth safety analysis via Med-HALT hallucination benchmark  
- Comparative assessment with multiple state-of-the-art models
- Release of tools and benchmarks facilitating future medical LLM development

In summary, the paper rigorously analyzed Google's Gemini model across medical tasks, revealed strengths and risks, and enabled further progress through public benchmarks and tools. Key findings show competence but also substantial gaps compared to leading models, highlighting important opportunities around safety and performance as this technology continues maturing.
