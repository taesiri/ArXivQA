# [Generative Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generative Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection":

Problem:
The paper explores semi-supervised anomaly detection on graphs, where some nodes are labeled as normal during training. This is a practical setting as normal nodes are easy to obtain due to their overwhelming presence. However, existing methods either assume full supervision with both normal and anomaly labels, or are designed for the unsupervised setting with no labels. They cannot fully exploit the available normal labels. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel generative approach called GGAD to better utilize the labeled normal nodes. The key idea is to generate outlier nodes that mimic anomaly nodes, which can then be used as negative samples to train a discriminator. Specifically, GGAD generates outliers based on ego-networks of sampled normal nodes to assimilate anomalies in local structure. It further introduces two constraints - local affinity separability and egocentric closeness, to enforce the outliers to have weaker affinity to normal neighbors but stay close to the sampled normal nodes in representation space. This allows the generated outliers to match the distribution of real anomalies.

Key Contributions:
- Explores the practical yet under-studied semi-supervised anomaly detection problem on graphs and provides an evaluation benchmark.

- Proposes GGAD, a novel generative approach to fully exploit labeled normal nodes by generating graph-structure aware outliers.

- Introduces an innovative outlier generation method with two tailored constraints to produce outliers that assimilate anomalies in both graph structure and representation space.

- Shows superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art methods on 4 real-world datasets. The constraints and outlier generation are also thoroughly analyzed.
