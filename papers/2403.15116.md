# [Collision Avoidance Safety Filter for an Autonomous E-Scooter using   Ultrasonic Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling safe operation of autonomous electric scooters (e-scooters) in pedestrian areas. Specifically, the authors aim to design a low-cost collision avoidance system using multiple ultrasonic sensors that can detect obstacles and safely stop the e-scooter to prevent collisions. This is important since autonomous e-scooters typically have limited sensors compared to autonomous cars due to cost restrictions.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a "collision avoidance safety filter" that processes noisy distance measurements from 3 low-cost ultrasonic sensors (one facing forward, two angled to the sides) to detect nearby obstacles. A filter smoothes the sensor measurements. Then a "distance controller" computes a safe velocity for the e-scooter based on the distance to obstacles, reducing velocity as needed to ensure the e-scooter can safely stop before a collision. The controller sets the velocity to zero if the obstacle is within a predefined "stopping distance". The approach weighs the measurements from the 3 sensors based on steering angle so it prioritizes obstacles directly in the vehicle's path.

Main Contributions:
- Hardware setup and software implementation details to add low-cost ultrasonic sensors and collision avoidance to a self-balancing autonomous e-scooter 
- Exponential smoothing filter design to process noisy and occasionally missing ultrasonic measurements
- Intuitive gain-scheduled control scheme to limit velocity based on measured distance and ensure safe stops
- Demonstrated effectiveness of proposed approach with real-world driving experiments, both for static and moving obstacles
- Framework designed for easy transferability to other cost-sensitive autonomous vehicles or micromobility platforms

The paper provides an accessible design guide for adding a safety-focused collision avoidance capability using low-cost components, with experimental results validating the solution. Key aspects are the ultrasonic sensor processing and intuitive tuning of the controller thresholds based on the vehicle, environment, and required safety margins.
