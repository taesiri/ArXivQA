# [FoolSDEdit: Deceptively Steering Your Edits Towards Targeted   Attribute-aware Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing guided image synthesis methods like SDEdit focus on generating high-quality and realistic images but neglect that they actually model a data distribution, not individual images. 
- As a distribution, SDEdit has a small but concerning chance of generating images that contradict user intentions specified in the input guiding images.
- This vulnerability could potentially be exploited to deliberately attack SDEdit and steer it to generate images with unintended attributes.

Proposed Solution: 
- Formulate the attack objective as Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA) which adds perturbations to input guiding images to make SDEdit generate a distribution aligned with a specified target attribute.
- Show that traditional adversarial noise struggles for TAGA while natural perturbations like exposure and blur can easily influence generated attributes.
- Propose FoolSDEdit attack which jointly optimizes adversarial exposure and blur added to inputs by framing the execution strategy search as a neural architecture search problem.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and formally define the vulnerability of SDEdit in modeling attribute-related data distributions. 
- Propose the novel Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA) threat model against guided image synthesis.
- Design an optimized adversarial attack FoolSDEdit using exposure and blur to effectively realize TAGA.
- Conduct comprehensive experiments validating FoolSDEdit can attack SDEdit to produce unintended attributes.

In summary, the paper identifies and exposes a concerning vulnerability in guided image synthesis methods to deliberately produce images with unintended attributes specified by attackers. The paper makes multiple contributions in defining, designing and demonstrating such generative attribute attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel attack called Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA) that fools the guided image synthesis method SDEdit into generating images with targeted attributes that differ from the attributes indicated in the input guide images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel attack called Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA) against the guided image synthesis method SDEdit. Specifically, the attack aims to force SDEdit to generate images that exhibit a targeted attribute (e.g. gender, age, race) that contradicts the attribute expressed in the input guiding image (e.g. a stroke painting). 

To achieve this attack, the paper first shows that traditional adversarial noise perturbations struggle to achieve the attack objective. However, it finds that natural perturbations like exposure variation and motion blur can easily influence the attributes of generated images.

Leveraging these observations, the main contribution is developing an attack method called FoolSDEdit that:

(1) Incorporates joint adversarial exposure and blur attacks, adding optimized exposure and motion blur to input images.

(2) Frames the execution strategy for different perturbations as a network architecture search problem, allowing flexible combination of various perturbations. This results in an optimized strategy for attacking SDEdit.

The proposed FoolSDEdit attack method is shown to be effective in forcing SDEdit to generate targeted attributes on facial image datasets, demonstrating the vulnerability. Addressing this could be an important area of future work to improve the robustness and fairness of generative models like SDEdit.
