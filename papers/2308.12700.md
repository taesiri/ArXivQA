# [A Parse-Then-Place Approach for Generating Graphic Layouts from Textual   Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12700)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we automatically generate high-quality graphic layouts from textual descriptions, where the text poses implicit, combined, and incomplete constraints?The key points are:- Textual descriptions tend to specify layout constraints in an implicit, vague, and abstract way, unlike other conditional layout generation tasks where constraints are explicitly given. - Descriptions often pose multiple types of constraints jointly, including element types, sizes, positions, hierarchies etc. Existing methods only consider one type of constraint.- Users don't tend to specify all elements in text, requiring the model to complete omitted but important elements.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a two-stage "parse-then-place" approach with an intermediate representation (IR) that transforms implicit constraints into explicit ones. The place stage uses a Transformer model to generate layouts from the explicit IR, and can handle combined and incomplete constraints via carefully designed sequence representations. Unlabeled layouts are exploited via pre-training.So in summary, the paper aims to enable automatic graphic layout generation from natural language through a decomposition into understanding the text constraints and then generating layouts conditioned on them. The key novelty is handling the unique nature of textual constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a two-stage approach named "parse-then-place" for generating graphic layouts from textual descriptions. The key contributions are:1. It introduces an intermediate representation (IR) between text and layout to formally represent various layout constraints like element types, sizes, positions, hierarchies etc. With IR, generating layout from text is decomposed into two stages - parsing text to IR, and placing elements based on the constraints in IR.2. For the parsing stage, it leverages pretrained language models to transform the implicit constraints in text to explicit ones in IR. This handles the challenge of constraint understanding. 3. For the placing stage, it carefully designs the input-output sequence format to represent combined and incomplete constraints in a unified way. This enables generating layouts according to complex constraints using a single model.4. It proposes to exploit large-scale unlabeled layouts to improve the layout generation model via a pretrain-then-finetune strategy. This compensates for the lack of text-layout pairs.5. Extensive experiments on two new datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over strong baselines in layout quality, diversity and consistency with the text descriptions.In summary, the key contribution is a new two-stage framework that decomposes the text-to-layout problem and leverages external knowledge sources to address the unique challenges like constraint understanding, combined constraints, incomplete constraints and data scarcity. This enables high-quality layout generation guided by natural language.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage approach called parse-then-place for generating graphic layouts from textual descriptions, which introduces an intermediate representation to decompose the problem into a parsing stage that extracts explicit constraints from text using a pre-trained language model, and a placement stage that generates layouts conditioned on the constraints using a Transformer-based model pretrained on unlabeled layout data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper on text-to-layout generation compares to other related research:- This is one of the first papers to tackle the specific task of generating graphic layouts (e.g. webpages, UI designs) from textual descriptions. Prior work has explored text-to-layout generation for other domains like 3D house plans or virtual scenes, but not graphic layouts.- A key contribution is the proposed intermediate representation (IR) that transforms implicit layout constraints in text to explicit constraints that are easier for models to utilize. Other text-to-layout papers do not use an intermediate representation.- The two-stage parse-then-place approach utilizing the IR is novel. Other methods are end-to-end without an intermediate parse stage. The two stages allow leveraging pre-trained language models for parsing and unlabeled layout data for the place stage.- For the place stage, representing layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence problem has been explored before, but the way constraints and layouts are represented as sequences is tailored for this task.- Pretraining on unlabeled layout data is a useful technique not seen in prior text-to-layout papers. The structural nature of layouts allows synthesizing training data.- The model architectures adopted are standard transformer encoder-decoders, similar to some other text-to-layout and text-to-image models. But the overall approach and training methodology is unique.- Evaluation on graphics-focused datasets Web5K and RICO2.5K differentiates the work from scene-based text-to-layout tasks. The metrics are also more comprehensive.In summary, this paper pushes text-to-layout generation in a new direction focused on graphic layouts, with innovations in the IR representation, two-stage approach, sequence modeling, and leveraging unlabeled data. The comparisons on graphics tasks and datasets advance the state-of-the-art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Generalizing their approach to more types of graphic design beyond web pages and mobile UIs. The paper mentions they plan to investigate applying their method to other graphic design tasks.- Extending the intermediate representation (IR) to support user constraints specified in other modalities besides text, such as images. The authors suggest looking at how to expand the IR to handle multi-modal input.- Using more powerful pre-trained language models (PLM) in the parse stage. The results indicate that improving the parsing model with a better PLM could further boost the overall performance.- Improving performance on high-level textual descriptions. The authors note their method does not perform as well on abstract, high-level descriptions compared to more detailed ones. Research into handling vague, subjective constraints could help.- Supporting arbitrarily nested hierarchy constraints. The paper mentions their approach currently does not handle deeply nested hierarchies well, so enabling the generation of complex nested structures is an area for improvement.- Reducing the labeled data requirements. While the paper introduces an intermediate representation and leverages unlabeled data to reduce supervised data needs, further work on semi-supervised or few-shot learning could be beneficial.In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the approach to new tasks/modalities, improving handling of complex constraints, and reducing reliance on large labeled datasets. The paper provides useful insights into current limitations that could guide follow-up research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage approach called parse-then-place for generating graphic layouts from textual descriptions. It introduces an intermediate representation (IR) between the text and layout to represent various layout constraints like element types, sizes, positions, and hierarchies. The approach first parses the text into an IR using a pretrained language model, transforming implicit constraints into explicit ones. It then generates the layout conditioned on the IR using a Transformer-based model. The model is pretrained on a large number of unlabeled layouts to learn layout patterns and finetuned on labeled data. Experiments on two datasets of web and mobile UI layouts show the approach generates more visually pleasing and consistent layouts compared to baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition, sequence representation, and utilization of unlabeled data in tackling the challenging text-to-layout problem.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new two-stage approach for generating graphic layouts from textual descriptions. The first stage, called the parse stage, takes a textual description as input and converts it into an intermediate representation (IR) that explicitly represents the layout constraints described in the text. This is done by fine-tuning a pretrained language model (T5) to map text to IR. The second stage, called the place stage, takes the IR as input and generates a layout that satisfies the constraints. This is done by a Transformer-based layout generation model which is carefully designed to handle combined and incomplete constraints from the IR. The key ideas are: (1) decomposing the problem into parse and place stages by introducing an intermediate representation, (2) leveraging pretrained language models in the parse stage, and (3) designing the place stage model architecture and its input/output sequence format to handle combined and incomplete constraints. Experiments on two new datasets for web and mobile UI layouts demonstrate the approach's effectiveness over baselines. The results show it can generate more aesthetically pleasing layouts that better match the textual descriptions.
