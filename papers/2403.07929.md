# [Sketching the Heat Kernel: Using Gaussian Processes to Embed Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Embedding high-dimensional data in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces is important for analyzing and understanding the structure of the data. Common techniques like diffusion maps rely on computing the top eigenfunctions of an affinity matrix on the data, but choosing how many eigenfunctions to use can be challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a novel method called "Gaussian process embeddings" for embedding data, based on computing realizations of a Gaussian process on the data. 
- Specifically, take the covariance of the Gaussian process to be the heat kernel. This allows the straight-line distances in the embedding to approximate a diffusion distance on the original data.
- Avoid needing sharp cutoffs on which eigenfunctions to use by combining all of them in the Gaussian process realizations, preserving more small-scale structure.

Main Contributions:
- Formally introduce Gaussian process embeddings and show distances in the embedding provably approximate a diffusion distance, avoiding eigenfunction cutoff issues.
- Demonstrate Gaussian process embeddings are more robust to outliers compared to diffusion maps.
- Provide algorithms to compute the embeddings efficiently.
- Include extensive experiments on manifolds and point clouds comparing to diffusion maps. Show Gaussian process embeddings can overcome limitations like self-intersections and struggles embedding stretched manifolds.
- Examine impact of varying heat kernel power and using Bernoulli matrices instead of Gaussian matrices for sketching.

In summary, the paper proposes Gaussian process embeddings as a novel and robust method for non-linearly embedding high-dimensional data in Euclidean spaces in a way that provably approximates an underlying diffusion geometry on the data.
