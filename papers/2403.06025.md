# [CarbonNet: How Computer Vision Plays a Role in Climate Change?   Application: Learning Geomechanics from Subsurface Geometry of CCS to   Mitigate Global Warming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is important to mitigate climate change but faces challenges due to high computational cost of large-scale simulations and difficulty in generalizing pre-trained models with complex physics. 
- The goal is to predict surface displacement response to carbon injection under different subsurface geometries to inform decision making for CCS projects.

Proposed Solution: 
- Formulate it as a computer vision problem. Use subsurface geometry images as input. Predict displacement images (static case) or displacement change over time (transient case).

- For static case, compare CNN, ResNet and proposed ResNetUNet architectures to predict displacement images. ResNetUNet combines strengths of ResNet and UNet to avoid information loss during encoding/decoding.

- For transient case, use sequence of displacement images as input. Compare LSTM and Transformer models to predict future displacement. Transformer can capture long-term dependencies better than LSTM.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation as computer vision problem for geomechanics.
- ResNetUNet architecture that outperforms CNN/ResNet by avoiding information loss.
- Comparison of LSTM and Transformer for transient displacement prediction.
- Dataset of 10,000+ subsurface geometry images paired with simulated displacement fields.
- State-of-the-art approach to apply computer vision for geomechanics, not restricted to specific cases, robust performance.
- Models contribute value to carbon storage projects and climate change mitigation.

The paper clearly describes the problem and presents an innovative computer vision solution. Key contributions are the dataset, ResNetUNet model architecture and transformer comparison that advance state-of-the-art in applying deep learning to geomechanics simulations. The approach is generalized and robust for informing carbon storage decisions to combat climate change.
