# [Enhancing Long-Term Recommendation with Bi-level Learnable Large   Language Model Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Enhancing Long-Term Recommendation with Bi-level Learnable Large Language Model Planning":

Problem: 
Traditional recommendation systems focus on maximizing immediate user satisfaction by catering to their short-term interests. However, this can lead to issues like filter bubbles where users only see recommendations similar to what they already like. The paper argues that it is important to consider the long-term engagement of users by planning ahead and making recommendations that balance immediate satisfaction with long-term diversity. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a bi-level learnable large language model (LLM) planning framework called BiLLP to enhance long-term recommendation. The key idea is to leverage the powerful planning capabilities of LLMs pre-trained on massive text data to plan ahead for recommendations. 

The framework has two levels of learning:

1. Macro-learning: Includes a Planner LLM that generates high-level plans for recommendations aimed at long-term goals. It references a memory of guiding principles updated by a Reflector LLM that summarizes insights from past recommendation interactions.

2. Micro-learning: Includes an Actor LLM that personalizes the high-level plans into specific recommendations for each user. A Critic LLM evaluates actions to update the Actor policy. This is similar to the Actor-Critic algorithm in RL.

By combining macro and micro learning in a hierarchical manner, BiLLP can effectively acquire both high-level principles and personalization for long-term recommendation planning.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel framework BiLLP that leverages the inherent planning capabilities of LLMs for long-term recommendation 

- Implements a bi-level learning approach with macro and micro levels to teach the LLM important principles and personalization

- Shows significantly improved long-term engagement over existing methods in simulated interactive recommendation environments

- Demonstrates the capability of LLMs to learn effective planning for recommendations despite limited training data

In summary, the key innovation is using bi-level learning to unlock the planning potential of LLMs, to address the important but understudied problem of optimizing long-term recommendation engagement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas presented in this paper:

This paper proposes a bi-level learnable recommendation planning framework called BiLLP to leverage both the extensive reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models for enhancing users' long-term engagement, incorporating reflective learning and actor-critic reinforcement learning mechanisms to acquire both high-level and personalized planning capacities over sparse data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel bi-level learnable large language model planning (BiLLP) framework to enhance long-term engagement in recommendation systems. Specifically:

1. It introduces the idea of exploring the planning ability of large language models (LLMs) to optimize long-term engagement in recommendations through a bi-level planning scheme. 

2. It proposes the BiLLP framework with four modules - Planner, Reflector, Actor, and Critic. This enables learning the planning ability at both macro and micro levels with low variance estimations of Q-values.

3. It conducts extensive experiments to validate the capability of LLMs to plan for long-term recommendation and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed BiLLP framework over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key contribution is leveraging and enhancing the planning prowess of LLMs to devise personalized and effective long-term recommendation policies that balance immediate and long-term user engagement.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that traditional recommendation systems often excessively cater to users' immediate interests while neglecting long-term engagement. Could you expand more on why this is an issue and the potential negative impacts it could have?

2. The key motivation of your work is to leverage the planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for long-term recommendation. However, the pre-training objectives of LLMs may not align well with optimization of long-term engagement. Could you discuss more about the core challenges you aim to address here and why directly applying LLMs may not work well?  

3. Your proposed BiLLP framework has a hierarchical structure with macro-learning and micro-learning components. What are the key strengths of having this two-level approach rather than a single integrated end-to-end model? How do the different levels complement each other?

4. Could you explain more about why you chose to implement the Planner, Reflector, Actor and Critic modules as separate LLM instances rather than having a single overarching LLM underlying the entire framework? What are the tradeoffs with each design?

5. The Reflector module generates reflective text to extract high-level guiding principles from past trajectories. What types of insights does this reflection capture that would be valuable for the Planner? Could you provide more details on how these principles are identified? 

6. In the micro-learning level, the Actor module incorporates both the guidance from the Planner's thoughts as well as its own memory. When there is discrepancy between the two, how are priorities and decisions made on which experiences to leverage more?

7. The Critic module estimates the advantage function rather than directly estimating Q-values. Could you explain in more detail why this was done and how it helps stabilize learning compared to prior approaches?

8. For the memory components of different modules, fixed-size buffers are used to store experiences. What strategies did you explore for determining what gets overwritten when the buffers reach capacity? How sensitive is performance based on the memory size?

9. The paper mentions the tool library for the Actor contains functionality difficult for the LLM itself to acquire. What are some examples of tools you found useful? In the future, how viable would it be to teach the LLM these skills itself through the learning process?

10. The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods. What aspects of the BiLLP framework do you think contribute most to its superior performance in optimizing for long-term engagement? What are some limitations that still need to be addressed?
