## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes light field imaging in restrictive object spaces (ROS-LF), where the object space of the imaging system is limited compared to traditional light field imaging. The authors show that using a traditional light field system directly in a ROS leads to distorted microlens images. They deduce this is caused by a change in the position of the angular plane compared to the spatial plane. To address this, they propose a flexible angular plane (FAP) composed of a virtual aperture plane and separated angular plane for ROS-LF. Based on the FAP, they derive principles for non-distorted microlens images and f-number matching in ROS-LF systems. They also propose a ROS-LF imaging model and two-step calibration method. The model differs from traditional LF only by an aperture constant term related to the ROS details. Experiments with a simulated ROS-LF system verify the proposed principles and calibration performance. Overall, this paper provides important analysis and principles for enabling light field imaging in restrictive object spaces.
