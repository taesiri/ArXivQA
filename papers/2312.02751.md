# [C-NERF: Representing Scene Changes as Directional Consistency   Difference-based NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02751)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes C-NeRF, a novel method to detect 3D changes in scenes represented by neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Given two image sets of a scene captured before and after changes, C-NeRF can generate a change map from any specified view direction indicating regions that have changed. The key idea is to first align the two NeRF scene representations, then identify change points based on a direction-consistency constraint - real changes have consistent representations across views while noise does not. Change indicators are computed for each point to create the change map. Experiments on a new multi-scene dataset with diverse changes demonstrate that C-NeRF significantly outperforms baseline NeRF-based and 2D change detection methods in accurately identifying instance-level and fine-grained changes from arbitrary views. The ability to render detailed change maps from any viewpoint enables new applications in scene monitoring and measurement. Limitations include sensitivity to NeRF rendering quality and inability to handle large scenes. Overall, the novel change representation and direction-consistency approach advance the capability of neural scene representations to perceive 3D changes over time.
