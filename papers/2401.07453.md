# [Model Editing at Scale leads to Gradual and Catastrophic Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Knowledge editing in large language models (LLMs) is an attractive capability to correct incorrectly learned facts or incorporate new facts without expensive retraining. 
- Current model editing methods are usually evaluated on reliability, specificity, and generalization over 1-2 edits. But practical utility requires ability to make many sequential edits without hurting model performance.

Methods Evaluated
- The paper evaluates two state-of-the-art model editing methods - ROME and MEMIT - by making multiple sequential edits to GPT-2XL using the CounterFact dataset.

Key Findings
- Both methods exhibit "gradual forgetting" - progressive losing ability to recall previously edited facts and perform downstream tasks as more edits are made.
- This gradual forgetting is followed by "catastrophic forgetting" where model abruptly loses all coherence/functionality due to a single "disabling edit".
- For ROME, disabling edits are fundamental and occur even if edited first. For MEMIT, effect is normalized over multiple layers.
- Edits affect unrelated facts indicating lack of specificity. MEMIT forgets fewer facts than ROME when scaled.

Contributions 
- First work to associate model editing with catastrophic forgetting and highlight importance of downstream task evaluation.
- Identified two phases of forgetting that limit scalability of current methods.
- Calls for developing editing methods that can counteract gradual and catastrophic forgetting when scaled.

Overall, the paper provides extensive analysis of two popular model editing techniques at scale, discovers fundamental problems of gradual and catastrophic forgetting that affect scalability, and highlights need for methods robust to these issues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper evaluates two popular model editing methods, ROME and MEMIT, at scale by sequentially making multiple edits to language models, finding they undergo gradual then catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge and abilities, limiting their usefulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors comprehensively evaluate current state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods (ROME and MEMIT) at scale by making multiple sequential edits to language models. They propose evaluating knowledge editing methods on downstream task performance in addition to knowledge editing metrics.

2) They show that as models are sequentially edited, they undergo two phases of forgetting - gradual forgetting where the model progressively loses the ability to recall previously edited facts and perform downstream tasks, followed by catastrophic forgetting where the model abruptly loses most function. 

3) They discover "disabling edits" - single edits that completely cripple the model, rendering it unable to perform any tasks. They find that disabling edits are fundamental to ROME but can be normalized in MEMIT.

4) Through this analysis, they highlight serious limitations in the scalability and robustness of current knowledge editing techniques, calling for improved methods that can make multiple edits without catastrophic forgetting of prior abilities. They argue that practical use requires the ability to edit models at scale.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods fail when scaled up to multiple sequential edits due to gradual then catastrophic forgetting, limiting their practical utility. The authors call for developing techniques that can counteract this forgetting.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Model editing - The paper focuses on methods for editing the knowledge contained in large language models without full retraining. This is also referred to as knowledge editing.

- Scalability - A major focus of the paper is evaluating model editing techniques when multiple sequential edits are made, in order to assess scalability.

- Forgetting - The paper analyzes two types of forgetting that occur when sequentially editing models - gradual forgetting and catastrophic forgetting. 

- ROME - Rank-One Memory Editing, one of the two state-of-the-art model editing techniques evaluated.

- MEMIT - Mass-Editing Memory in a Transformer, the other model editing technique evaluated. 

- Evaluation metrics - The paper advocates for evaluating techniques not just on editing reliability/locality but on downstream task performance.

- Disabling edits - Edits made to a model that completely disrupt function, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More fundamental to ROME.

- CounterFact dataset - The dataset of counterfactual statements used to evaluate editing techniques.

So in summary, the key terms cover the model editing techniques, evaluation approaches, types of forgetting analyzed, and datasets used in the paper's experiments. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods and results presented in this paper:

1. The paper evaluated the performance of model editing methods ROME and MEMIT when making multiple sequential edits on GPT-2XL. How might the results differ if scaled to even larger models like GPT-3 or PaLM? Would gradual and catastrophic forgetting still be issues at scale?

2. The authors discovered "disabling edits" with ROME that catastrophically impair model performance with just a single edit. What properties of an edit make it more likely to be disabling? Can we predict disabling edits ahead of time?  

3. The authors propose evaluating model editing techniques on downstream task performance in addition to knowledge editing metrics. What additional downstream tasks beyond SST-2 and MRPC would be informative to measure model degradation from editing?

4. The paper found edited facts "consistently bleed into" unrelated knowledge stored in the model for both ROME and MEMIT. What underlying mechanisms cause this lack of specificity even for methods designed to make localized edits?  

5. For gradual forgetting, what causes the model to progressively "lose its ability" to recall previously edited facts and perform downstream tasks as more edits accumulate? Is the model overfitting to recent edits?

6. The authors define two concepts - "gradual forgetting" where the model slowly loses abilities with more edits, and "catastrophic forgetting" with an abrupt disabling edit. How are these concepts similar or different from usage in other domains like continual learning?

7. The disabling edits for ROME appear tied to the edited layer weights drifting until layer compatibility is destroyed. Does this indicate facts may be stored across multiple layers, requiring coordination of edits? 

8. The paper speculates disabling edits may be identifiable beforehand with ROME to prevent catastrophic forgetting. What approaches could detect or mitigate disabling edits?

9. For MEMIT, what causes the lower efficacy of edits compared to ROME? Is it trading off reliability of edits for improved model stability over many edits?

10. What extensions to ROME or MEMIT could improve scalability - such as better handling gradual drift of edited layers or coordinating edits across multiple layers? How can insights from continual learning be applied?
