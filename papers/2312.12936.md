# [Concept-based Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12936)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review and taxonomy of concept-based explainable AI (C-XAI) methods. C-XAI methods aim to provide more transparent and interpretable AI models by explaining their decisions in terms of human-understandable concepts rather than raw input features. 

The paper first defines key terminology, including four types of concepts (symbolic, unsupervised bases, prototypes, textual), three concept-based explanation types (class-concept relations, node-concept associations, concept visualizations), and the difference between post-hoc methods and explainable-by-design models.

It then introduces a taxonomy categorizing C-XAI approaches into 9 categories based on concept annotation (supervised, unsupervised, hybrid, generative), concept training (post-hoc analysis or joint model training), and explanation type. Guidelines are provided on selecting suitable methods based on constraints and desired outcomes. 

The paper extensively reviews methods in each category, outlining their key aspects and differences. Post-hoc methods either employ symbolic concepts to study class-concept relations or node associations, or extract unsupervised bases to define relations. Explainable-by-design models explicitly represent concepts, using supervised concepts (jointly or by instillation), unsupervised bases, prototypes, or textual concepts from language models. Hybrid models combine supervised and extracted concepts.  

The paper also analyzes evaluation strategies, including metrics to assess concept effect on predictions, concept quality, datasets, and human evaluations. It further highlights first applications, such as in image generation, outlier detection, and healthcare.

Key contributions include: (1) a formal definition and taxonomy of concepts and explanations; (2) categorization guidelines tailored to constraints and outcomes; (3) an extensive literature review, comparison and criticism analysis; (4) a thorough report on evaluation metrics, datasets and human studies; (5) an outline of promising research avenues.

Overall, this paper provides a structured foundation that will assist researchers, practitioners and stakeholders in advancing more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.
