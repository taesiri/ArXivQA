# [GIM: Learning Generalizable Image Matcher From Internet Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image matching is a fundamental computer vision task with many applications like 3D reconstruction, localization, etc. 
- Existing learning-based methods train separate models for indoor and outdoor scenes which limits their generalization to novel scenarios. This is impractical when scene type is unknown.  
- Standard datasets for image matching have limited diversity due to inefficient data construction pipelines.

Proposed Solution: 
- GIM - A self-training framework to learn a single generalizable image matcher from internet videos.
- Key ideas:
   - Use videos as they are abundant, diverse and unlimited
   - Train base architecture on standard datasets
   - Generate labels on videos by fusing outputs of base model and complementary methods
   - Filter outliers, propagate labels to distant frames
   - Retrain with strong augmentations
- Also proposed ZEB - First zero-shot image matching benchmark with 12 diverse datasets 

Main Contributions:
- GIM - First framework to learn generalizable matcher from videos via self-training
- Significantly improves generalization of state-of-the-art architectures
- Performance improves as more video data is used
- Single GIM model consistently outperforms in-domain baselines on downstream tasks
- ZEB - Allows thorough assessment of generalization capability across domains

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of poor generalization of existing image matchers by proposing a self-training framework GIM that can learn from abundant and diverse internet videos. This leads to significant improvements in zero-shot robustness as demonstrated comprehensively using the introduced benchmark ZEB.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GIM, a self-training framework that leverages abundant and diverse internet videos to learn a single generalizable image matching model for in-the-wild data across different domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. GIM, the first framework that can learn a generalizable image matcher from internet videos. 

2. ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching.

3. Experiments showing the effectiveness and generality of GIM for both image matching and various downstream tasks. Specifically, GIM is able to improve the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-the-art image matching architectures as more video data is used. A single GIM model also achieves strong performance on downstream tasks like visual localization and 3D reconstruction, outperforming domain-specific baselines even on their own domains.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a method (GIM) to learn a single generalizable image matching model from abundant internet videos, as well as constructing a benchmark (ZEB) to properly evaluate generalization, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
