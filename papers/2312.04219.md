# [Swap distance minimization in SOV languages. Cognitive and mathematical   foundations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04219)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the principle of swap distance minimization, which predicts that word order variations from a canonical order that require fewer adjacent constituent swaps are less costly and thus more likely. The authors focus on the order of subject (S), object (O), and verb (V) in three flexible word order SOV languages from different families - Korean, Malayalam, and Sinhalese. They introduce the concept of word order rotation as an analog to mental rotation in visual cognition, providing a cognitive basis for swap distance minimization. Statistical analyses reveal evidence supporting swap distance minimization in all three languages, but the effect is weaker in Sinhalese. Swap distance minimization manifests more strongly than simply preferring the canonical order in Korean and especially Malayalam. The strength of minimization compared to other principles like predictability maximization varies across languages, likely interacting with degree of word order flexibility. Overall, the research provides cross-linguistic evidence for swap distance minimization as a general cognitive pressure shaping word order variation, subsumes preference for canonical orders, and suggests word order evolution tends to preserve canonical orders.
