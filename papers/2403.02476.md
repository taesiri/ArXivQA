# [A Simple Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function   Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the convergence behavior of temporal-difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. TD learning is an important reinforcement learning technique for estimating the value function of a policy in a Markov decision process (MDP). However, analyzing TD learning is challenging, especially with function approximation, due to the complex dynamics induced by temporal correlations in the data. Prior analyses either assume i.i.d. samples, use a projection step, or require intricate arguments to ensure stability. The key question studied is: can we retain the simplicity of a projection-based analysis without actually using projection in the TD algorithm?

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel inductive proof technique to establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for TD(0) learning with linear function approximation under Markovian sampling, without relying on projection. The key ideas are:

1) Set up a recursion to track the mean-squared error using the TD update rule. The recursion features three terms - one capturing the algorithm's steady-state behavior, one being the noise variance, and one modeling the effect of temporal correlations (viewed as a disturbance). 

2) Use an inductive argument, assuming a uniform bound on past iterates, to show the disturbance term is $O(\alpha^2)$ - the same order as the noise variance. This is enabled by the mixing property of the Markov chain.

3) Combine the pieces to show the iterates remain bounded, and the mean-squared error convergence guarantee follows.

Main Contributions:

- Provides the first simple proof for unprojected TD learning with linear function approximation under Markovian sampling, via a novel induction-based technique.

- Establishes that the disturbance due to temporal correlations is $O(\alpha^2)$ without relying on a projection step.

- Demonstrates the general recipe - decompose recursion, bound disturbance term using induction, combine pieces - applies more broadly to analyzing stochastic optimization schemes.

- Conjectures the inductive technique will find applications in studying perturbation robustness (e.g. delays) of reinforcement learning algorithms.

In summary, the paper makes a methodological contribution in how convergence analyses for TD learning with function approximation can be simplified, while also discussing potential impacts.
