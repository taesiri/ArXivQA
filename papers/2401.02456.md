## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Wildfires are increasingly destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses of lives, infrastructure, and wildlife habitats. There is an urgent need to advance wildfire management techniques to effectively address this growing threat. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer immense promise to transform wildfire management across three key phases: pre-fire, active fire, and post-fire. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of AI-enabled UAV systems tailored to multi-stage wildfire management, especially regarding monitoring and detection methods.

Solution:
This paper provides an extensive survey of the state-of-the-art in AI-enabled UAVs for wildfire management across the three phases. It offers an in-depth analysis of UAV technologies, specifications, and sensors relevant to wildfire applications. The paper examines pre-fire management approaches like statistical fire risk analysis, prevention strategies, and prediction models that leverage machine learning for early warnings. For active fires, it reviews a wide range of computer vision and deep learning techniques for tasks like classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring. Reinforcement learning algorithms are also analyzed for real-time wildfire tracking. For post-fire management, the paper surveys methods for forest recovery, damage assessment, evacuation planning, and safe operations via augmented reality.  

Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of over 700 research articles on employing AI-enabled UAVs in multi-stage wildfire management, addressing gaps in prior survey papers
- Detailed overview of UAV types, architectures, sensors, datasets, and applications tailored to wildfire tasks
- Review of statistical, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques for pre-fire planning, active fire response, and post-fire recovery
- Identification of challenges and future directions in areas like real-time onboard processing, algorithm reliability testing, fire modeling with UAV data integration, and interdisciplinary collaborative initiatives

The paper delivers an extensive reference for researchers, policymakers, and professionals to optimize efforts and formulate effective wildfire management strategies leveraging the latest AI and UAV advancements.
