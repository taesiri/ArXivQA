# [Rethinking the Up-Sampling Operations in CNN-based Generative Network   for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images (GANs, Diffusions) poses threats of misuse. Addressing this requires developing generalizable deepfake detection methods.
- Prior works focus on improving detection algorithms or augmenting datasets. However, there is a gap in exploiting source-invariant representations from generator architectures for detection.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper rethinks CNN-based generator architectures to establish a generalized representation of synthetic artifacts stemming from the upsampling operation.

- It introduces the concept of Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) to capture the localized interdependence among pixels caused by upsampling layers. This manifests as structural artifacts in synthetic images.

- NPR serves as the artifact representation to train a deepfake detection model. By capturing traces of upsampling components, NPR provides source invariance.

Contributions:
- Shows upsampling operators can produce generalized artifacts beyond just frequency-based artifacts. 

- Explores effect of upsampling from perspective of local image pixels rather than whole image.

- Proposes NPR as a simple yet effective technique to achieve generalization by exploiting common upsampling component.

- Extensive experiments on 28 models validate NPR's generalization ability and state-of-the-art performance. Achieves 12.8% improvement over prior works.

In summary, the key idea is to rethink CNN generator architectures to extract generalized upsampling artifacts through local pixel analysis. The proposed NPR representation enables building detectors that can generalize to unseen GAN and Diffusion models.
