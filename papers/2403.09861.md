- The template can be configured for specific modulation schemes based on their mathematical models. Alternatively, the kernels can be trained from modulation signal datasets.

- The resulting NN-defined modulators can be converted into a unified NN framework for portable deployment across devices. They can leverage acceleration capabilities for efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptually, an NN-defined modulator abstraction layer is proposed to enable flexibility and portability of modulators across heterogeneous gateways.

- Technically, a model-driven methodology is used to design interpretable and lightweight NN-defined modulators rooted in mathematical foundations.

- Experimentally, extensive evaluations are conducted on multiple platforms like Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi. Applications are demonstrated to generate compliant signals for protocols like ZigBee and WiFi.

In summary, the paper puts forth an innovative neural network modulator design paradigm to address critical challenges in IoT gateway transmitters regarding extensibility and portability across diverse hardware platforms.
