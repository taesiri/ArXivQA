# [Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Interpretability research aims to understand behaviors in large language models by ablating (removing/modifying) components and observing the impact on model outputs. 
- However, recent work has shown evidence of "self-repair" - downstream model components changing behavior to compensate when earlier components are ablated. 
- This makes ablation-based interpretability metrics unreliable, as ablations may be "repaired" rather than showing the true importance of the component.

Main Contributions
1) Demonstrates imperfect, noisy self-repair exists across full training distribution when ablating individual heads (not just layers).
2) Up to 30% of direct effect self-repair is explained by changes in LayerNorm scaling factors. Ablations alter residual stream norm which impacts scaling.
3) Identifies "sparse neuron anti-erasure" in MLP layers - small sets of neurons negate outputs from earlier components ("erasure"). Ablating upstream components removes this erasure ("anti-erasure") causing self-repair.

Proposed Solutions
- LayerNorm self-repair can be reduced by avoiding zero ablations or freezing LayerNorm.
- Overall self-repair remains imperfect so circuit analysis methods may still work if focused on identifying "important vs unimportant" components rather than precisely quantifying impact.
- Speculates self-repair could be a byproduct of model "iteratively inferring" the output over layers, rather than intentional compensation.

Implications
- Self-repair makes ablation-based metrics unreliable for interpreting model behaviors.
- Taking models "off-distribution" with interventions can cause unanticipated consequences.
- More research needed into precisely quantifying self-repair and root causes of the phenomena.
