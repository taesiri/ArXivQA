# [Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09746)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Do current neural conversational agents have effective goal-oriented conversation planning abilities?

The authors point out that prior work on target-oriented conversational tasks lacks the crucial notion of "planning" that has been studied in goal-oriented AI. They propose the task of Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) to specifically evaluate whether models can produce effective plans to guide a conversation towards a target word. 

The main hypothesis appears to be that current neural conversational agents, including recent strong generative models, lack effective planning abilities for goal-oriented conversation. The experiments on existing and new models using the TGCP framework are designed to test this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is whether neural conversational agents have effective goal-oriented planning abilities, which is tested through the proposed TGCP task and experiments. The underlying hypothesis seems to be that current models are lacking in this crucial capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) task as a framework to assess the prerequisite ability of a model for goal-oriented conversation planning. 

2. Conducting experiments on the TGCP framework using several existing retrieval-based neural models and recently proposed strong generative neural models of conversational agents.

3. Revealing through the experiments that current dialogue models have difficulty planning natural conversations to achieve given goals. The results show a trade-off between target achievement and conversation naturalness that models face.

In summary, the paper proposes a new task and framework (TGCP) to evaluate neural conversational agents' abilities for multi-turn planning towards a goal. Experiments reveal limitations of current models in achieving goals while maintaining natural conversations. The TGCP task is put forward as a way to make progress on goal-oriented conversation planning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes the Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) task to assess agents' ability for multi-turn planning in goal-oriented dialog, and experiments reveal the challenges current models face in achieving targets while ensuring natural conversation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on target-guided open-domain conversation:

- It proposes a new task called Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) to explicitly evaluate multi-turn planning abilities. Prior work like Target-Guided Open Domain Conversation (TGOC) focused more on achieving targets within a single turn.  

- It tests both retrieval and generative models on TGCP. Most prior work focused only on retrieval models. Evaluating Blender shows the potential of large pretrained generative models.

- It reveals tradeoffs between target achievement and conversation naturalness. Retrieval models tend to achieve targets better but have less smooth/natural conversations. Generative models are more natural but struggle with target achievement.

- It shows the benefit of "pre-designing" subgoal sequences compared to selecting subgoals "on-the-fly". Pre-designing leads to higher target achievement for the generative model.

- The TGCP self-conversation setup removes uncertainties from human partners, allowing pure model evaluation. But it remains different from real conversations with humans.

Overall, this paper advances the field by formalizing and evaluating multi-turn planning for goal-oriented conversation. The analysis also reveals challenges current models still face in balancing target achievement and conversation quality. The proposed TGCP task provides a useful benchmark for future work on planning in open-domain dialogue systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions:

- Improving the achievement ratios of generative models by refining their subgoal strategies. The results showed that the pre-design subgoal strategy of Blender+PreDes improved achievement ratio over the on-the-fly subgoal strategy of Blender+CKC. Further exploring subgoal strategies for generative models could help overcome the trade-off between achievement ratio and conversation naturalness.

- Exploring methods to make agents plan conversations more efficiently like humans. The results showed humans achieved goals in fewer turns while maintaining high conversation probability. Developing agents with similar efficient planning abilities is a challenge. 

- Applying the TGCP framework to other goal-oriented conversation tasks beyond just target-guided conversation. The idea of self-conversation planning may be useful for assessing planning abilities in other goal-oriented dialog settings.

- Developing methods that can solve the TGCP task with higher performance across all metrics. The results revealed current challenges for models, so developing better techniques tailored for TGCP that improve achievement, smoothness and probability is an open research direction.

- Exploring TGCP in less constrained settings, like planning conversations with actual uncertain user responses rather than self-conversations. Removing the self-conversation assumption and incorporating real humans can make the setting more realistic.

In summary, the main future directions are improving generative model subgoal strategies, making planning more efficient, applying TGCP to other tasks, developing better TGCP techniques, and exploring less constrained versions of TGCP. Advancing research in these areas could lead to better goal-oriented conversation planning abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the task of Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) to evaluate whether neural conversational agents have goal-oriented conversation planning abilities. The TGCP task requires agents to produce a full conversation plan leading to a given target word. The planning process is modeled by having the agent converse with itself to search for conversation paths to the target. Experiments are conducted using existing retrieval models like Sequence Matching Network and PMI, as well as recent generative models like Blender. The results reveal challenges facing current technology - retrieval models tend to achieve targets but lack natural conversation flow, while generative models have smoother conversations but struggle to reliably achieve targets. The paper introduces TGCP as a framework to assess prerequisite planning abilities in conversational agents without human involvement. Overall the paper proposes and analyzes a new goal-oriented conversation planning task to understand and improve planning capabilities in conversational agents.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the task of Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) to evaluate whether neural conversational agents have goal-oriented conversation planning abilities. In TGCP, agents are given a target word and an initial utterance, and must generate a full conversation plan that leads to mentioning the target word. This tests agents' ability to plan ahead over multiple turns to achieve a conversation goal. The paper conducts experiments on TGCP using existing retrieval models like DKRN and CKC, as well as generative models like Blender. The results reveal a tradeoff between target achievement and conversation naturalness - retrieval models tend to achieve targets but produce unnatural conversations, while generative models produce more natural conversations but struggle to reliably achieve targets. The generative model Blender+PreDes improves achievement through pre-designed subgoal sequences, showing promise for overcoming the tradeoff. Overall, the results reveal challenges for current models in exhibiting human-like planning for goal-oriented conversation. The paper proposes TGCP as a useful framework for assessing and developing agents' prerequisite planning abilities for goal-oriented conversation.

In summary, the paper introduces the TGCP task to evaluate neural conversational agents' abilities for multi-turn goal-oriented conversation planning. Experiments reveal tradeoffs between existing models' target achievement and conversation naturalness. The task provides a useful framework for developing and assessing planning-aware conversational agents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes the task of Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) to evaluate whether neural conversational agents have goal-oriented conversation planning abilities. In the TGCP task, agents are given a target word and an initial utterance, and required to generate an entire multi-turn conversation plan that ends with mentioning the target word. The authors propose modeling the planning process by having the agent converse with itself (self-conversation) to search for potential conversation paths that achieve the goal. They implement this using the Blenderbot model, where the agent first generates a subgoal sequence leading to the target using ConceptNet, and then iteratively generates partial conversations achieving each subgoal using Blenderbot conditioned on previous partial conversations. The overall conversation plan is selected based on the probability of generating each partial conversation. This allows assessing the agent's planning abilities in a self-contained setting without human involvement.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Prior work on target-oriented conversational tasks lacks a crucial notion of planning that has been studied in goal-oriented AI agents. 

- The paper proposes the Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) task to evaluate whether conversational agents have goal-oriented planning abilities.

- In TGCP, the agent must make a plan to lead a conversation to a given target word. The agent converses with itself (self-conversation) to search for paths to the goal.

- Experiments are conducted on TGCP using existing retrieval models and recent generative models. Results show a trade-off between target achievement and conversation naturalness.

- A generative model with a pre-designed subgoal strategy improves target achievement while maintaining naturalness, suggesting refining subgoal strategies as a way forward.

In summary, the main problem is assessing and improving planning abilities in conversational agents for goal-oriented dialog. The paper proposes the TGCP task as a framework for evaluating this, reveals challenges with current methods, and points towards refining subgoal strategies as a promising direction.
