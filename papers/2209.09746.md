# Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Do current neural conversational agents have effective goal-oriented conversation planning abilities?The authors point out that prior work on target-oriented conversational tasks lacks the crucial notion of "planning" that has been studied in goal-oriented AI. They propose the task of Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) to specifically evaluate whether models can produce effective plans to guide a conversation towards a target word. The main hypothesis appears to be that current neural conversational agents, including recent strong generative models, lack effective planning abilities for goal-oriented conversation. The experiments on existing and new models using the TGCP framework are designed to test this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is whether neural conversational agents have effective goal-oriented planning abilities, which is tested through the proposed TGCP task and experiments. The underlying hypothesis seems to be that current models are lacking in this crucial capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing the Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation Planning (TGCP) task as a framework to assess the prerequisite ability of a model for goal-oriented conversation planning. 2. Conducting experiments on the TGCP framework using several existing retrieval-based neural models and recently proposed strong generative neural models of conversational agents.3. Revealing through the experiments that current dialogue models have difficulty planning natural conversations to achieve given goals. The results show a trade-off between target achievement and conversation naturalness that models face.In summary, the paper proposes a new task and framework (TGCP) to evaluate neural conversational agents' abilities for multi-turn planning towards a goal. Experiments reveal limitations of current models in achieving goals while maintaining natural conversations. The TGCP task is put forward as a way to make progress on goal-oriented conversation planning.
