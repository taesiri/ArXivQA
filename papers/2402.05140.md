# [Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05140)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive proficiency in natural language tasks. However, their performance degrades significantly on specialized domains not well represented in their pretraining corpus, such as protein sequences, SMILES notations for molecules, or scientific data. Developing specialized models from scratch for these domains is expensive and requires abundant in-domain data and compute. Therefore, the authors explore how to effectively repurpose general-purpose LLMs for specialized domains.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose Tag-LLM, a novel framework to adapt LLMs using modular meta-linguistic tags. There are two types of tags: (1) domain tags that indicate domain-specific representations in the input and provide relevant context (e.g. \token{Protein}), and (2) function tags that encode instructions for task families (e.g. \token{Binding Affinity}). The tags are parameterized as continuous vector embeddings and appended to the LLM's embedding layer, preserving the original model weights. 

A 3-stage protocol is introduced to hierarchically train the tags from general to specialized, exploiting different levels of available in-domain data:
(1) Domain tags are trained via next-token prediction on unlabeled domain data 
(2) Single-domain function tags are trained on supervised single-domain labeled data
(3) Cross-domain function tags are trained on supervised multi-domain labeled data, learning shared abilities across domains

Additionally, non-textual prediction tasks are handled by pairing function tags with specialized output heads.

Contributions:
- Novel method to inject localized and reusable domain/function knowledge into LLMs via learned tags 
- Generalizable framework that allows combining tags to solve unseen tasks
- Outperforms expert models and baselines on scientific tasks like protein-drug binding 
- Significantly boosts LLM performance on 10 translation tasks
- More parameter-efficient and transferable than existing LLM tuning methods


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Tag-LLM, a method to repurpose general-purpose large language models for specialized domains by learning modular input tags that provide domain-specific conditioning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Tag-LLM, a novel framework to repurpose general-purpose large language models (LLMs) for specialized domains and tasks. The key ideas and contributions are:

1) Proposing two types of input tags - domain tags and function tags - to condition the LLM. Domain tags represent specialized domains like proteins or molecules, while function tags represent abilities like translation or binding affinity prediction.

2) Designing a 3-stage training protocol to learn these tags using different levels of in-domain data, from unlabeled corpora to task-specific input-output pairs. This allows the method to leverage available data more efficiently. 

3) Showing the tags enable zero-shot generalization by combining them in novel ways. A function tag trained on multiple domains can generalize to new unseen domain and task combinations.

4) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance by using Tag-LLM to adapt a general LLM to specialized scientific tasks like protein property prediction and drug discovery. The method matches or exceeds specialized expert models on several benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel, modular framework to effectively and efficiently adapt general LLMs to specialized domains and tasks where they initially perform poorly, using limited supervision. This expands the applicability of LLMs to more technical fields.

The paper proposes a method called "Tag-LLM" to repurpose general-purpose large language models for specialized domains using learnable "input tags" that are appended to the model's embedding layer. The key ideas focus on using modular domain and function tags, trained in a three-stage protocol, to adapt the LLMs. Experiments show improved performance on tasks like multilingual translation, predicting protein descriptors, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness, drug combination prediction, and binding affinity prediction between proteins and drugs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes both domain tags and function tags. What is the key difference in their intended use? Why is it beneficial to have both types of tags?

2. The three-stage training protocol exploits different levels of data availability. Can you walk through the key ideas and benefits of each stage? What kind of data is used in each?

3. The paper shows competitive performance on translating between unseen language pairs like Spanish-Portuguese. What capabilities of the proposed method allow for this zero-shot generalization? 

4. For the chemical descriptor prediction task, the method outperforms even a nearest neighbor baseline. Why might a non-parametric model struggle on tasks like this involving specialized symbolic notations? 

5. The paper argues that cross-entropy loss used in language modeling is poorly suited for regression problems. Explain this argument and how the proposed method addresses it.

6. LoRA is shown to sometimes outperform the method on binding affinity prediction but uses far more parameters. What is the tradeoff here? Could the performance gap be closed by using a larger backbone LLM?

7. The enrichment of domain tags in stage 2 aims to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Empirically, how much does enrichment help boost performance?

8. The results show that removing either the domain or function tags hurts performance. Why might both components be important? What unique roles do they play?

9. Varying the tag length reveals a peak in performance followed by overfitting. Explain why this effect might occur.

10. The paper focuses on adapting general LLMs, but specialized models for chemical and biological domains already exist. In what ways could those specialized architectures complement or be integrated with the tagging approach?
