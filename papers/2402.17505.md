# [BASES: Large-scale Web Search User Simulation with Large Language Model   based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Analyzing large-scale user behavior is important for improving web search systems, but relies on costly real-user experiments with issues like privacy concerns and data quality. User simulation is a promising direction to address this.  
- Simulating realistic and diverse web search user behaviors at scale is challenging. Need to ensure each user has a unique and reasonable profile. And predicting personalized search behaviors precisely is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose BASES, a framework to simulate large-scale web search user behaviors using large language model (LLM) based agents.
- Design user profile attributes tailored for web search users. Profiles have static attributes like gender and dynamic attributes like interests.
- Generate unique profiles at scale via a synergistic synthesis method combining manual definition and LLM assistance. Ensures efficiency and diversity.  
- Tailored LLM agents with distinct profiles simulate users and perform search queries and clicks via specialized prompting strategies. Generates precise personalized behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework BASES to simulate large-scale web search user behaviors using LLM-based agents and specialized user profiling.
- Demonstrate BASES effectiveness via experiments on IR tasks, improving performance and showing promise for low-resource adaptation.
- Construct WARRIORS, a new large-scale dataset with 100,000 users' search sessions in both Chinese and English generated by BASES.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative framework to simulate web search users at scale via LLM-based agents. Thorough experiments prove its efficacy. The release of the WARRIORS dataset also facilitates future research.
