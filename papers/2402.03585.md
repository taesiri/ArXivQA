# [Decoder-Only Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predominant approaches for unsupervised medical image registration rely on encoder-decoder neural networks to predict dense displacement fields from image pairs. However, recent networks are becoming increasingly larger, requiring more parameters, computations, and memory.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors identify redundancy in the encoder part of typical encoder-decoder networks used for registration. They propose LessNet, a compact decoder-only network for image registration.

- LessNet substitutes the entire encoder with simple handcrafted pooling features like max, mean and min pooling across multiple scales. The features are fed directly into a convolutional decoder to predict full-resolution displacement fields.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate the redundancy of a learnable encoder for registration by showing a randomly initialized encoder achieves comparable performance to a trained one.

- Propose a compact LessNet decoder-only architecture that relies solely on handcrafted pooling features instead of a learned encoder.

- Show LessNet achieves similar or better registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art encoder-decoder networks like VoxelMorph and TransMorph, while requiring far fewer parameters and computations.

- Demonstrate LessNet's generalizability by applying it to both 2D inter-subject registration on OASIS dataset and 3D atlas-to-subject registration on IXI dataset.

- Show LessNet supports integration into a diffeomorphic registration framework through a velocity field output and scaling/squaring.

In summary, the paper makes a case for compact decoder-only networks by identifying redundancy in the encoder for registration tasks. The proposed LessNet eliminates the encoder entirely while still achieving strong registration performance.
