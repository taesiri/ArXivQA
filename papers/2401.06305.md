## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Smooth and safe speed planning is critical for autonomous vehicles, but remains challenging due to complex dynamic environments. 
- Existing methods have limitations in synchronizing time and space, ensuring global optimality, computational efficiency, and handling space-time constraints with dynamic obstacles.
- Thorough validation in simulations and real-world tests are often missing when proposing new methods.

Proposed Solution - Multi-Profile Quadratic Programming (MPQP):
- Constructs a space-time (ST) graph to explore feasible regions considering dynamic obstacles and their possible passage orders.
- Uses breadth-first search to find multiple feasible "profiles" of passing orders along the ST graph.
- Formulates quadratic programming for each profile that optimizes for comfort and travel time while satisfying bounds from the ST graph.
- Employs techniques to handle space-time synchronization, curvatures/lateral limits, and soft constraints.

Key Contributions:
- Presents a mathematical framework to explore spatio-temporal gaps and find optimal speed profiles that address limitations of prior arts.
- Retains convex optimization properties for global optimality and efficiency.
- Introduces methods to incorporate lateral acceleration limits and path curvatures.  
- Provides extensive validation in high-fidelity CARLA simulator over diverse scenarios.
- Demonstrates real-world feasibility with public road tests.

In summary, the paper proposes a rigorous speed optimization method called MPQP that explores space-time combinations and finds globally optimal and smooth speed profiles. MPQP overcomes limitations of prior work and is thoroughly validated in simulation and real-world tests.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the multi-profile quadratic programming (MPQP) method proposed in the paper:
