# [GauHuman: Articulated Gaussian Splatting from Monocular Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02973)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GauHuman, a 3D human model based on Gaussian splatting that achieves both fast training (1-2 minutes) and real-time rendering (up to 189 FPS). GauHuman represents the human using a set of 3D Gaussians defined in a canonical pose space. These Gaussians are transformed to the posed space using Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), with the weights predicted using an offset to the SMPL model's skinning weights. To enable fast optimization, the Gaussians are initialized using the SMPL model, and the splitting/cloning processes use KL divergence to avoid redundant Gaussians. Additionally, a novel merge operation is introduced to combine redundant Gaussians. Experiments on the ZJU_MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis with the proposed fast training and rendering. Key components leading to this efficiency include the articulated Gaussian representation, initialization using human pose priors, regulated split/clone/merge of Gaussians, and the restricted set of Gaussians needed for high quality rendering. Together these allow high quality 3D human modeling from monocular video at previously infeasible speeds.
