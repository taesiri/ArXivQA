# [GauHuman: Articulated Gaussian Splatting from Monocular Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating high-quality 3D human models from monocular videos is important for applications like VR/AR and gameplay. However, existing methods require either expensive capture setups or hours of training time and seconds of rendering time per frame, hindering real-world usage. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes "GauHuman", a 3D articulated Gaussian splatting model for fast and high-quality novel view synthesis of humans from monocular videos. 

Key ideas:
1) Encode 3D Gaussian splatting representation in a canonical pose space and transform them to posed space via learned linear blend skinning (LBS). Design pose refinement and LBS weight modules to capture details.

2) Initialize and prune Gaussians using 3D human priors like SMPL. Use KL divergence to regulate splitting/cloning of Gaussians. Propose a novel "merge" operation to reduce redundancy.

Main Contributions:
1) Articulated Gaussian splatting model for real-time rendering (up to 189 FPS) and fast training (1-2 minutes).

2) Effective optimization techniques like initialization based on human priors, KL divergence guided split/clone/merge operations to control number of Gaussians.

3) State-of-the-art view synthesis on ZJU_MoCap and MonoCap datasets with 13x faster training and 100x faster rendering over baselines, while maintaining quality.

In summary, this paper presents an optimized articulated Gaussian splatting model "GauHuman" to create high-quality 3D human models from monocular videos with significantly faster training and real-time rendering compared to prior art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GauHuman, a 3D human model with Gaussian splatting representation that achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis with fast 1-2 minute training and real-time 189 FPS rendering on monocular videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes GauHuman, a 3D human model with Gaussian Splatting representation for fast training (1-2 minutes) and real-time rendering (up to 189 FPS). 

2. To enable fast optimization of articulated 3D Gaussian Splatting, it initializes and prunes 3D Gaussians with 3D human prior, regulates the split/clone process via KL divergence measures, and proposes a novel merge operation to further speed up training.

3. Experiments on two monocular human video datasets validate that GauHuman achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance with fast training and real-time rendering speed. Notably, GauHuman can model a 3D human with ~13k Gaussians without sacrificing rendering quality.

In summary, the key contribution is a new 3D human modelling approach with Gaussian Splatting that achieves superior efficiency in both training and rendering compared to prior arts, while generating high quality results.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper encodes Gaussian Splatting in a canonical space and transforms the 3D Gaussians into a posed space via linear blend skinning (LBS). Why is encoding an articulated 3D human model in a canonical space beneficial rather than directly in the posed space? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

2) The paper proposes a pose refinement module and an LBS weight field module to learn fine details of articulated 3D humans. How do these modules work and why are they important for improving rendering quality? What other approaches could be explored?

3) The paper initializes the 3D Gaussians using the SMPL human model vertex positions. What is the benefit of initializing based on a 3D human model rather than random initialization? How sensitive is the performance to different initialization strategies?

4) Explain the proposed split, clone, merge and prune operations for controlling the number of 3D Gaussians. How does the addition of Kullback-Leibler divergence and a merge operation help improve optimization efficiency?

5) The paper achieves real-time rendering speeds. Analyze the computational complexity differences between Gaussian splatting and other representation methods like NeRF that lead to these speed improvements. What performance tradeoffs exist?

6) How does the method balance quality and speed? What rendering quality limitations still exist compared to other state-of-the-art methods that use more expensive volumetric representations? Where is further work needed?

7) The method currently does not extract explicit 3D surface meshes. What modifications would need to be made to support mesh extraction? What challenges exist in extracting meshes from splatted Gaussians?

8) Discuss the advantages and limitations of using a parametric model like SMPL as a prior within the pipeline. How does reliance on SMPL constrain generalization capabilities?

9) Compare and contrast the proposed approach to other concurrent work in fast articulated human modeling like GART. What unique advantages does each method provide?

10) What forms of complexity could be further explored to push the limits of the current approach, such as more complex clothing, lighting variations, etc? What types of datasets could help drive further progress?
