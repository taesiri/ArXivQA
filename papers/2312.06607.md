# [DiAD: A Diffusion-based Framework for Multi-class Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06607)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based framework called DiAD for multi-class anomaly detection and localization. DiAD consists of three main components: a pixel-space autoencoder, a latent-space Semantic-Guided (SG) network connected to the Stable Diffusion denoising network, and a feature-space pre-trained feature extractor. The key innovation is the SG network, which reconstructs anomalous image regions while preserving semantic information. This addresses issues with prior diffusion models like DDPM and LDM that struggled with category preservation and semantic consistency in anomaly reconstruction. Additionally, a Spatial-aware Feature Fusion block is introduced to maximize reconstruction accuracy when dealing with large defective areas. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with DiAD achieving 96.8 and 97.2 AUROC for localization and detection on MVTec-AD. The method significantly outperforms previous diffusion-based and non-diffusion methods. DiAD pushes anomaly detection capabilities using the exceptional reconstruction power of diffusion models while overcoming their limitations in multi-class settings.
