# [A Survey on Video Prediction: From Deterministic to Generative   Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper surveys the field of video prediction, which involves forecasting future video frames given a sequence of observed frames. This is an important capability for machines to plan and respond to dynamic environments, with applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, special effects, weather forecasting, etc. However, it is challenging because it requires balancing low-level pixel processing with high-level understanding of scene dynamics over long time horizons.

Proposed Solution  
The paper proposes a novel taxonomy that categorizes video prediction methods based on their stochasticity into deterministic, stochastic, and generative approaches. Deterministic methods aim for pixel-level accuracy but often produce blurry results by averaging multiple outcomes. Stochastic methods introduce randomness to generate diverse reasonable predictions. Generative methods focus on long-term synthesis rather than pixel accuracy.

Key Contributions
- Comprehensive overview of datasets, algorithms, challenges and future directions in video prediction
- Analysis of the shift from deterministic to generative methodologies to enhance creativity 
- Stochasticity-based taxonomy that accentuates the transition from low-level to high-level understanding
- Advocating for stochastic evaluation metrics, increased compute, and large-scale high-quality video data
- Emphasizing the need to balance pixel accuracy and scene dynamics comprehension to enable long-term, high-resolution prediction

In summary, the paper provides an extensive survey of video prediction research and presents insights to guide progress towards more versatile, efficient and creative models with a deeper grasp of real-world phenomena.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper comprehensively surveys the field of video prediction, proposing a novel taxonomy centered on algorithm stochasticity that highlights the gradual transition from deterministic pixel-level fitting towards embracing generative methodologies for long-term stochastic modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel taxonomy for video prediction algorithms centered on the stochasticity of the approaches. Specifically, the taxonomy categorizes video prediction methods into three groups:

1) Deterministic prediction: Methods that aim to perform pixel-level fitting to deterministic target frames. However, optimizing for pixel-level metrics often results in blurry predictions. 

2) Stochastic prediction: Methods that introduce stochastic variables or distributions into deterministic models, or use probabilistic models directly, to allow sampling from motion distributions. This encourages the generation of diverse and reasonable predictions.

3) Generative prediction: Methods focused on generating reasonable long-term video sequences rather than precisely matching ground truth frames. This allows capturing complex stochastic motion and birth-and-death phenomena in videos. 

The paper argues there has been a shift from deterministic to more generative prediction approaches that can better model the uncertainty and creativity in natural videos. The taxonomy accentuates this transition and provides an organizing framework to analyze video prediction research.
