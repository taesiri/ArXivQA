# [Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03366)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the problem of referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) in videos. The main research questions it seeks to tackle are:

1. How can we ground referring expressions to multiple objects in videos rather than just a single object? Existing referring expression datasets and models focus on grounding expressions to a single target object. However, in real-world videos, a referring expression may correspond to multiple objects with the same semantics.

2. How can we handle temporal dynamics and status changes in referent objects? Referring expressions often describe objects exhibiting certain actions or temporal characteristics, which may not hold true across all frames. Existing video referring datasets do not model temporal status changes accurately. 

3. How can we develop an end-to-end model for referring multi-object tracking that handles variable number of target objects and their temporal dynamics? Most prior work follows a two-stage approach of object detection and expression matching. End-to-end modeling of referring expressions, detection, and tracking is still an open challenge.

To address these questions, the paper introduces a new task of RMOT, constructs two new benchmarks Refer-MOT17 and Refer-KITTI with multi-object and temporally dynamic expressions, and proposes an end-to-end transformer-based model, TransRMOT, for referring multi-object tracking. The model adapts the DETR architecture using separate track and detect queries to handle variable target objects and their statuses over time.

In summary, the key research contributions are: formulating the novel RMOT task, creating new benchmark datasets, and developing an end-to-end architecture for referring multi-object tracking in videos. The paper pushes the envelope of video grounding using natural language beyond existing single object settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task called referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) and developing a benchmark and method for this task. Specifically:

- They propose the RMOT task, which uses a natural language expression to refer to and track multiple objects in a video. This is more flexible and realistic than existing referring tasks that refer to a single object. 

- They create a new benchmark called Refer-KITTI for RMOT based on the KITTI dataset. It contains videos with expression annotations referring to multiple objects with temporal dynamics.

- They develop an end-to-end Transformer-based model called TransRMOT for the RMOT task. It fuses visual and linguistic features and uses separate track and detect queries to handle referring to multiple objects across frames.

- Experiments show TransRMOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Refer-KITTI compared to adapted object tracking and referring methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the more flexible and realistic RMOT task, creating a benchmark for it, and developing an effective model to tackle the new task. This moves referring understanding towards handling real-world complexity.
