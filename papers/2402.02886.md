# [Time-Distributed Backdoor Attacks on Federated Spiking Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) enable energy-efficient computing using neuromorphic data encoded in time. Federated learning (FL) allows decentralized training while preserving data privacy. However, the security of SNNs and FL with neuromorphic data is under-explored. Specifically, their vulnerability against backdoor attacks has not been studied before.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first shows the feasibility of using FL to train SNNs on neuromorphic data. Then it evaluates if existing backdoor attacks in FL can be transferred to the SNN+FL setting. Since these attacks lead to poor performance, a novel attack strategy called "Time Bandits" is proposed.

- The Time Bandits attack distributes the backdoor trigger temporally across frames of the neuromorphic data samples. It also distributes the trigger over multiple non-colluding attackers, where each attacker poisons a subset of frames. At test time, the full trigger across all frames triggers the backdoor.

Main Contributions:

- First evaluation of SNNs with FL using neuromorphic data, showing performance degradation with more devices. 

- Adaptation of existing backdoor attacks in FL to the SNN+FL setting. A single attacker achieves high attack success rate only for simple datasets.  

- A new "Time Bandits" attack that splits the trigger across time and attackers. It boosts attack performance and stealthiness compared to single attacker.

- Analysis of attack effectiveness under varying hyperparameters like number of attackers, IID vs non-IID data etc. Time Bandits is resilient in many settings.

- Evaluation of a defense method shows it is inadequate to protect SNNs against backdoor attacks.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the vulnerability of SNNs and FL using neuromorphic data against backdoor attacks. It also reveals the need for robust defenses tailored to this setting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the vulnerability of spiking neural networks and federated learning to backdoor attacks using neuromorphic data, proposes a new time-distributed attack strategy tailored to this setting, and evaluates an existing defense, finding it inadequate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Evaluating the feasibility of using spiking neural networks (SNNs) and neuromorphic data in federated learning (FL) settings. The authors show that FL is viable with SNNs and neuromorphic data, although performance degrades as the number of devices increases.

2) Pioneering the investigation into backdoor attacks in FL using SNNs and neuromorphic data. Specifically:

(a) Adapting known backdoor attacks from standard FL to the SNN and neuromorphic setting.

(b) Designing a novel attack strategy called "Time Bandits" tailored to SNNs and FL, which distributes the backdoor trigger temporally across malicious devices to enhance effectiveness and stealthiness. 

3) Considering single and multiple attacker scenarios, and evaluating the stealthiness of the proposed triggers using MSE and SSIM metrics.

4) Investigating if an existing backdoor defense can be applied to defend SNNs under neuromorphic data, revealing its inadequacy.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating backdoor attacks involving novel trigger designs for SNNs in the FL setting with neuromorphic data, underscoring the need for robust defenses tailored to this emerging area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Spiking neural networks (SNNs)
- Neuromorphic data 
- Federated learning (FL)
- Backdoor attacks
- Time Bandits (novel attack proposed in paper)
- Trigger (pattern used to launch backdoor attack)
- Attack success rate (ASR)
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Structural similarity index (SSIM)
- Non-IID data
- Defenses against backdoor attacks

The paper explores using SNNs and neuromorphic data in federated learning settings and evaluates their vulnerability to different types of backdoor attacks. A key contribution is the proposal of a new "Time Bandits" attack that distributes the attack trigger temporally across multiple malicious devices. Metrics like ASR, MSE and SSIM are used to evaluate attack performance and stealthiness. Defenses against such backdoor attacks are also analyzed. So these are some of the key terms and concepts covered in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new attack called "Time Bandits" which involves splitting the backdoor trigger across time rather than space. Why is splitting the trigger across time a particularly effective strategy for attacking spiking neural networks in a federated learning setup?

2. The paper evaluates the proposed Time Bandits attack with different numbers of attackers - 2, 4, and 8. How does increasing the number of attackers impact the effectiveness and stealthiness of the Time Bandits attack? What are the key trade-offs?

3. The Time Bandits attack is evaluated on several datasets - N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture. Which dataset characteristics make the attack more or less effective and why? How could the attack be adapted for other types of neuromorphic datasets?  

4. The paper shows that the Time Bandits attack is effective at defeating the STRIP defense. Why does splitting the trigger across time allow the attack to evade detection based on comparing sample entropy? How could the STRIP defense be adapted to better detect this type of attack?

5. The impact of non-IID data distribution on the effectiveness of Time Bandits is analyzed. Why does non-IID data distribution reduce attack success rate and how could the attack procedure be modified to improve resilience?  

6. Beyond the specific Time Bandits attack proposed here, what novel types of backdoor triggers and attacks are enabled by leveraging the temporal dynamics in neuromorphic data and spiking neural networks?

7. The threat model assumes either a single malicious device or multiple non-colluding devices. How would the analysis change if malicious devices explicitly colluded? What additional attack strategies would be enabled?

8. The paper focuses on image data backdoors. Could the Time Bandits concept be extended to other data types such as audio, sensor data, or video? What would be the challenges?

9. For practical deployment, how could the proposed Time Bandits attack concept be adapted or enhanced to maximize real-world effectiveness on fielded systems?  

10. What specific defensive mechanisms, either local or aggregated, could potentially protect against attacks like Time Bandits that leverage unique properties of spiking neural networks?
