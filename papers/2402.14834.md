# [MSynFD: Multi-hop Syntax aware Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Fake news spreads rapidly on social media, manipulating opinions and undermining credibility of information. 
- Existing fake news detection methods have limitations in handling subtle twists in news articles that contain mostly true information but introduce false details. These twists include:
   - Syntax-semantics mismatches like referential transfers that are hard to detect
   - Prior biases towards entities and emotional words that lead to unfair judgments
- Traditional semantic-based models using RNNs, CNNs and attention networks fail to capture local syntax and suffer from noisy irrelevant connections
- GNN-based syntax modeling also has limitations in information exchange across non-local neighborhoods and sub-connected statements

Proposed Solution - MSynFD:
- Incorporates complementary syntax information to deal with subtle fakes and mitigate prior biases 
- Introduces syntactical dependency graph and designs a Multi-hop Subgraph Aggregation (SAA) module
   - Captures multi-hop syntax relations to extend word perception
   - Adaptive gating filters noisy information 
   - Relative position bias emphasizes significance of low-hop relations
- Designs a sequential relative position-aware Transformer to capture semantics
- Introduces keywords-based debiasing module to mitigate bias towards emotional and entity words

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel multi-hop syntax-aware fake news detection to address syntax-semantics mismatch and keyword biases
- Designs SAA module to capture comprehensive hierarchical syntax structures
- Seamlessly integrates SAA module with relative position-aware Transformer
- Introduces keywords-based debiasing to mitigate preconceived notions within news

The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and shown to outperform state-of-the-art detection models on several performance metrics.
