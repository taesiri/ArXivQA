# KITE: Keypoint-Conditioned Policies for Semantic Manipulation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to enable robots to perform semantic manipulation - instruction following with both scene-level and object-level awareness. Specifically, the paper aims to tackle two key challenges:1) Enabling the robot to reason about what object/object part to manipulate based on natural language instructions that may reference objects or features in a visual scene (i.e. scene semantics) or parts of a particular object instance (i.e. object semantics).2) Determining how the robot can actually execute the desired manipulation behavior in 6D space after interpreting the instruction semantically. To address these challenges, the paper proposes KITE, a framework that grounds natural language instructions into 2D keypoints that identify objects or object parts, and then executes parameterized skills conditioned on those keypoints to perform precise 6D actions.The key hypothesis is that using 2D keypoints as an intermediate representation between language and low-level actions will allow for sample-efficient learning of semantic manipulation behaviors that generalize well to new scenes and objects compared to prior end-to-end approaches. The experiments on real-world tabletop, grasping, and coffee-making scenarios aim to validate whether KITE can effectively exhibit scene and object semantic awareness and precision manipulation in practice.In summary, the core research question is how robots can perform complex instruction following that requires disambiguating semantics at both the scene level across objects and at the object level across parts, which KITE aims to solve through grounded keypoints and skills.
