# [RSBuilding: Towards General Remote Sensing Image Building Extraction and   Change Detection with Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current methods for building extraction and change detection from remote sensing images treat them as separate tasks and do not leverage their shared knowledge. 
- Existing algorithms are designed for specific small datasets, lacking generalization across diverse scenes and resolutions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a unified foundation model called RSBuilding for both building extraction and change detection to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality.
- Use Transformer encoder backbones (ViT, Swin) to extract robust image features. Add a multi-level feature sampler to enrich scale information.
- Introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts to unify task representations and integrate spatiotemporal clues from dual images.  
- Develop a federated training strategy to enable smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, enhancing complementarity.

Main Contributions:
- First model to integrate building extraction and change detection within a single framework, highlighting their synergistic relationship.
- Multi-level feature sampler, cross-attention decoder with prompts, and federated training strategy to address key challenges.
- Collected and structured a large-scale multi-task building dataset with ~245,000 images.
- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Robust generalization ability validated through zero-shot testing.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel foundation model that can concurrently handle building extraction and change detection in a unified framework. The model design and training strategies enhance generalization across scenes and leverage complementary information between the tasks.
