# [RSBuilding: Towards General Remote Sensing Image Building Extraction and   Change Detection with Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current methods for building extraction and change detection from remote sensing images treat them as separate tasks and do not leverage their shared knowledge. 
- Existing algorithms are designed for specific small datasets, lacking generalization across diverse scenes and resolutions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a unified foundation model called RSBuilding for both building extraction and change detection to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality.
- Use Transformer encoder backbones (ViT, Swin) to extract robust image features. Add a multi-level feature sampler to enrich scale information.
- Introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts to unify task representations and integrate spatiotemporal clues from dual images.  
- Develop a federated training strategy to enable smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, enhancing complementarity.

Main Contributions:
- First model to integrate building extraction and change detection within a single framework, highlighting their synergistic relationship.
- Multi-level feature sampler, cross-attention decoder with prompts, and federated training strategy to address key challenges.
- Collected and structured a large-scale multi-task building dataset with ~245,000 images.
- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Robust generalization ability validated through zero-shot testing.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel foundation model that can concurrently handle building extraction and change detection in a unified framework. The model design and training strategies enhance generalization across scenes and leverage complementary information between the tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes RSBuilding, a general foundation model for building extraction and change detection in remote sensing images that unifies the tasks within one framework, introduces components to enrich multi-scale features and cross-task representations, and uses a federated training strategy to address limited multi-task annotation data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1) It proposes a general foundation model called RSBuilding for building understanding from remote sensing images, which integrates the tasks of building extraction and change detection within a unified framework. This highlights the complementary relationship between the two tasks.

2) It introduces several model components to enable the unified framework, including a multi-level feature sampler to enrich scale information, a cross-attention decoder based on task prompts to aggregate task-specific features, and a federated training strategy to address missing annotations and enhance complementarity. 

3) It constructs a large-scale building dataset with around 245,000 images for multi-task training of the foundation model. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the model's capability to handle the two diverse tasks simultaneously and its robust generalization ability.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a general foundation model that unifies building extraction and change detection tasks to exploit their synergy, along with associated model components, training strategies, and experiments to validate the unified model's effectiveness.
