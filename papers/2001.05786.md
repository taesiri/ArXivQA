# [A Categorical Framework for Learning Generalised Tree Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05786)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question is: How can we develop a categorical framework for learning automata that applies to a broad class of automata models, including tree automata,  while providing correctness and termination guarantees? More specifically, the paper aims to extend previous categorical work on automata learning (the CALF framework) in order to:1) Provide an abstract treatment of counterexamples, which are a core component of algorithms like L* that enable refinement of learned automata.2) Give a full abstract learning algorithm, whereas CALF focused mainly on abstract data structures. 3) Find constraints on the abstract framework that allow covering new examples like tree automata, which did not fit within the previous CALF constraints.The overall goal is to leverage category theory to get modular, generic, and provably correct automata learning algorithms that can be readily instantiated for different types of automata. The paper makes progress on this by extending CALF to handle algebras like tree automata, providing an abstract learning procedure, and giving proofs of correctness and termination based on the categorical framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a categorical framework for learning generalised tree automata, which accept sets of trees rather than just strings. The main contributions are:1. It extends previous categorical approaches to automata learning (CALF) to handle learning of algebraic structures, not just coalgebraic ones. This allows learning models like tree automata that do not have an obvious coalgebraic presentation.2. It provides the first detailed, step-by-step abstract learning algorithm in this framework, generalizing the classic L* algorithm. Previous categorical work focused more on abstract data structures. 3. It instantiates the framework to a broad class of set functors, recovering for the first time practical tree automata learning algorithms from the abstract theory.4. It incorporates a general notion of counterexamples using recursive coalgebras, and provides an abstract analysis of progress and termination.5. Overall, the paper shows how the categorical perspective can provide a unifying foundation for automata learning, while also guiding the design of new practical algorithms through instantiation. The abstraction makes proofs of correctness and termination generic.In summary, the key novelty is developing algorithms and theory for learning algebraic structures, and demonstrating how this enables systematic instantiation to practical algorithms for learning tree automata. The conceptual contribution is extending the reach of the categorical perspective on automata learning.
