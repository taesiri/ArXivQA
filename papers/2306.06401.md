# [Long-term Microscopic Traffic Simulation with History-Masked Multi-agent   Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Developing realistic long-term microscopic traffic simulators is challenging. Traditional rule-based simulators using heuristic models often fail to achieve accurate simulations due to the complexity of real-world traffic. Meanwhile, existing learning-based simulators trained with imitation learning suffer from the covariate shift issue, where the state distribution induced by the learned policy deviates from the training distribution, leading to unstable long-term simulations.

Proposed Solution: The authors propose a history-masked multi-agent imitation learning (HMMIL) method to address the covariate shift issue in multi-agent imitation learning for traffic simulation. Specifically, their method removes all vehicles' historical trajectory information and applies perturbations to their current positions during learning. This prevents the agent from accumulating errors from its own historical actions. A graph neural network based on edge-enhanced graph attention networks is used to model vehicle interactions and predict future trajectory distributions. The future positions are sampled from the distributions and smoothed to generate simulated vehicle trajectories.  

Main Contributions:
- Propose a new HMMIL method that can address the covariate shift issue in multi-agent imitation learning for stable long-term simulation
- Apply the method specifically to microscopic urban traffic simulation, achieving both short-term microscopic and long-term macroscopic similarity
- Evaluate on a large-scale real-world dataset, demonstrating better performance than state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing traffic patterns

The key novelty is in using the history masking and current state perturbation techniques to overcome the covariate shift issue in multi-agent imitation learning. This allows the method to generate accurate and stable long-term urban traffic simulation results, evaluated on a complex real-world dataset, which has not been achieved effectively before. The contributions advance research in applying imitation learning to microscopic traffic simulation.
