## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assembly processes can benefit from AR visualization to provide guidance and reduce errors, but requires accurate 6D object pose estimation and assembly state detection. 
- Existing methods have limitations in handling occlusion, state changes, and multiple objects during assembly.
- Most focus only on pose estimation of individual objects in static scenes rather than assemblies. 
- Other assembly state detection works use 2D detection, limited objects, or unavailable datasets.

Proposed Solution - ASDF:
- Presents Assembly State Detection utilizing Late Fusion (ASDF) for 6D pose and assembly state detection.
- Uses YOLOv8 architecture with RGB and depth input for pose estimation and refinement.
- Introduces assembly state detection, relative pose analysis between parts, and pose-state fusion.
- Refines pose using boundary point analysis along camera axis and weighting function.  
- Late fusion of deep learning and pose-based state predictions in Pose2State module.

Contributions:
- ASDF integrates assembly state detection for refined 6D estimation using late fusion.
- Synthetic dataset with printable parts and state annotations for reproducibility.  
- Outperforms pure deep learning methods in accuracy on ASDF and GBOT datasets.
- Handles occlusion, blurring, and state changes better than prior works.
- Enables markerless 6D pose and state tracking for AR assembly guidance.

The paper presents a way to improve 6D object pose estimation and assembly state detection by fusing both through a novel Pose2State module. Their ASDF method and dataset advance the capability for AR-based visualization to guide multi-object assembly processes.
