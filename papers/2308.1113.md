# [Multiobjective Optimization of Non-Smooth PDE-Constrained Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1113)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper gives an overview of recent research on multiobjective optimization of problems with PDE constraints and non-smoothness. The main research areas covered are:- Efficient algorithms for non-smooth multiobjective optimization, with and without PDE constraints. This includes a descent method for general non-smooth MOPs and a continuation method tailored to sparse optimization problems arising from regularization.- Surrogate modeling techniques to reduce the computational expense of evaluating PDE constraints in multiobjective optimization. Approaches like reduced basis methods are discussed.- Applications of multiobjective optimization in machine learning, such as inferring objective functions from data and regularization path computation for deep learning. - Using mixed-integer optimal control techniques to construct efficient data-driven surrogate models for PDE-constrained control problems. By manually introducing switching/non-smoothness, the modeling effort can be reduced.So in summary, the main research focus is on developing theory and algorithms for multiobjective optimization problems involving PDEs and non-smoothness. This includes both exploiting non-smoothness and introducing it to achieve computational gains. The goal is to extend multiobjective optimization to new problem classes arising in applications.
