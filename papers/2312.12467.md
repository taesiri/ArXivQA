# [Learning Flexible Body Collision Dynamics with Hierarchical Contact Mesh   Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Simulating flexible body dynamics with collisions is challenging due to the instantaneous impact propagating across the objects. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models typically require multiple message passing layers to propagate signals over long distances, increasing training time. 

- Flexible body dynamics are important in many applications like product design and manufacturing, but have been relatively less explored compared to fluid or rigid body dynamics.

Methodology:
- The paper proposes a Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer (HCMT) to efficiently simulate flexible body collision dynamics.

- It consists of an encoder-processor(CMT+HMT)-decoder structure. The encoder and decoder are similar to prior work.

- The key novelties are in the processor:
  - Contact Mesh Transformer (CMT) - Captures collision dynamics using dual self-attention on mesh and contact edges
  - Hierarchical Mesh Transformer (HMT) - Enables long-range propagation using hierarchical pooling and mesh self-attention
  
- CMT focuses on local collision dynamics while HMT handles longer-range flexible dynamics. The hierarchy quickly propagates collision effects across the objects.

- They use a learned pooling strategy of node selection using BFS and Delaunay mesh reconstruction for improving mesh quality.

Contributions:
- First work to incorporate collisions for flexible body dynamics using transformers and hierarchical meshes.

- Efficient combination of CMT and HMT for handling short and long-range interactions.

- Novel Impact Plate dataset based on industry practices for assessing display rigidity.

- Significantly outperforms baselines like MGN and Graph Transformer on multiple datasets including Impact Plate.

In summary, the paper makes flexible body collision simulation more feasible by effectively propagating short and long-range interactions using hierarchical graph transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchical contact mesh transformer model called HCMT that efficiently learns flexible body dynamics with collisions by using a contact mesh transformer to capture collisions and a hierarchical mesh transformer with pooled nodes and remeshed edges to enable longer-range interactions and faster training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. It proposes Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer (HCMT), which incorporates collisions into flexible body dynamics for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge.

2. It efficiently uses two Transformers with different roles for flexible and contact dynamics. 

3. It provides an Impact Plate benchmark dataset based on explicit methods where collisions occur in a very short timeframe. The dataset incorporates various design parameters to make it suitable for use in manufacturing.

4. HCMT outperforms other baseline models like MGN and Graph Transformer in modeling dynamics across different systems - static, rigid dynamics, and flexible dynamics.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel model architecture called HCMT that can effectively learn flexible body dynamics with contacts and collisions, as demonstrated through strong performance on different simulation datasets including a new challenging dataset introduced in the paper.
