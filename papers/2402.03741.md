# [SUB-PLAY: Adversarial Policies against Partially Observed Multi-Agent   Reinforcement Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have opened up many application prospects like drone swarms and robotic manipulation. However, the potential security threats during MARL deployment need more attention. Prior works focus on two-player competitions with complete state observations and cannot handle scenarios where the attacker only has partial observations in multi-agent environments. This poses challenges for generating effective adversarial policies.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes SUB-PLAY, a novel framework to generate adversarial policies against partially observed victims in multi-agent competitive environments. The key ideas are:

1) Decompose the attack into multiple subgames based on number of observable victim agents. Model each subgame as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) and obtain subpolicies.

2) Share transitions among different subgame replay buffers to mitigate imbalance due to varying subgame frequencies. Probability of sharing depends on occupancy rate, distance between subgames, number of subgames constructed etc.  

3) Evaluate subpolicies on multiple metrics and only retain top performers for each subgame in policy pool to reduce fluctuations.

4) Hardcode combination of subpolicies into final adversarial policy. Determine subgame at runtime based on observation and select corresponding subpolicy.


Main Contributions:

1) First framework to unveil capability of attackers to exploit vulnerabilities of victims' policies in multi-agent competitive environments, even with only partial observations.

2) Propose observable-driven subgame construction and transition sharing to address challenges posed by three common types of partial observability limitations.

3) Extensive experiments in two OpenAI environments demonstrating SUB-PLAY's effectiveness and outperformance over state-of-the-art attack framework Victim-play.

4) Analyze three potential defenses, emphasizing the need for MARL practitioners to consider deployment strategies rather than just enhancing algorithms. Insights provided on mitigating threats of adversarial policies.

In summary, this paper highlights an important security dimension in MARL and provides valuable insights into generating and defending against adversarial policies in partial observability settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes SUB-PLAY, a novel black-box attack framework to generate adversarial policies that can effectively exploit vulnerabilities in victim policies under partial observation in competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SUB-PLAY, a novel black-box attack framework for generating adversarial policies against victims with partial observations in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) SUB-PLAY is the first work to investigate the security threats of adversarial policies in multi-agent competitive environments with partial observability. It reveals that attackers can still effectively exploit vulnerabilities in the victim's policy even with incomplete state information. 

2) SUB-PLAY proposes an observable-driven subgame construction method to address three common types of partial observability limitations - uncertainty, distance, and region limitations. It also suggests sharing transitions among subpolicies to improve learning.

3) Extensive evaluations demonstrate SUB-PLAY's effectiveness in enhancing attack performance compared to prior art like Victim-play. The results also analyze the transferability of adversarial policies and explore potential defense strategies.

4) The paper emphasizes that practitioners should pay attention not only to improving MARL algorithm performance but also to deployment details like periodically updating policies, which is crucial for mitigating security threats posed by adversarial attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is designing, implementing and evaluating SUB-PLAY as an effective framework to generate adversarial policies against partially observed victims in multi-agent competitions. The results reveal the vulnerability of MARL systems even with incomplete state information.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my understanding, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Adversarial policies - Policies that aim to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a victim reinforcement learning (RL) system in order to degrade its performance. 

- Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) - Training multiple RL agents concurrently in the same environment.

- Partially observable environments - Environments where agents have incomplete or limited observations of the full global state.

- Zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (ZS-POSGs) - A formalism used to model the adversarial attack scenario as a game between the attacker and victim agents with partial observability.  

- Subgames - The paper decomposes the complex ZS-POSG into simpler partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) called subgames.

- Transition dissemination - A mechanism proposed to share transitions between different subgame replay buffers to improve training.  

- Policy meritocracy - A method to select the best performing subpolicies during training by evaluating multiple metrics.

- Observable-driven subgame construction - Subgames are constructed based on the number of observable victim agents.

So in summary, key concepts include adversarial policies, MARL, partial observability, subgames, transition sharing, and using a divide-and-conquer approach to tackle complexity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called SUB-PLAY for generating adversarial policies in partially observable multi-agent environments. Can you explain in detail the key intuition and reasoning behind adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to construct multiple subgames in SUB-PLAY? 

2. The paper introduces the concept of occupancy rate (OR) to characterize the relative frequency of different subgames. Can you walk through how OR is leveraged in SUB-PLAY's transition dissemination mechanism? What is the impact of using static vs. dynamic approaches for determining OR?

3. The paper evaluates three different methods for determining occupancy rates - static estimation, static observation, and dynamic observation. Can you analyze the tradeoffs between computational overhead, accuracy, adaptability, and other factors among these three methods? When would you recommend using each one?

4. Explain the details of how subpolicy training and policy combination are performed in SUB-PLAY. What mechanisms are in place to address challenges like non-stationarity and promote attack performance?  

5. Compare and contrast the attack performance of SUB-PLAY under different types of partial observability limitations - uncertainty, distance, and region. What common themes or differences can you identify across the results?

6. The paper demonstrates the transferability of adversarial policies generated by SUB-PLAY across similar partially observable settings. However, transferability was limited to substantially different victims. Analyze the potential factors contributing to this trend.

7. Can you walk through the ablation study results and analyze the impact of key components like subgame construction, transition dissemination, and policy meritocracy on overall attack performance?

8. The paper explores three potential defense strategies against adversarial policies, but notes challenges in completely mitigating threats. Discuss the limitations of adversarial retraining, policy ensemble, and victim fine-tuning as defenses. 

9. Based on the analysis of defenses in the paper, what recommendations would you propose to practitioners aiming to securely deploy MARL systems in competitive environments?

10. The paper assumes the victim's policy is fixed during attacks. Critically analyze whether relaxing this assumption would significantly impact the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY or adversarial policies in general.
