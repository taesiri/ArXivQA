# [Accelerating Diffusion Sampling with Optimized Time Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown impressive performance for generative tasks like image synthesis. However, they require a large number of sampling steps, which is computationally expensive. Recent methods based on numerical ODE solvers have enabled high-quality image generation with fewer steps, but still use uniform time discretizations, which is suboptimal. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an optimization framework to find better non-uniform time steps tailored to a specific ODE solver to minimize the distance between the approximate and true solution. 

Key Ideas:
- Formulate an optimization problem to minimize the upper bound on the distance between ground truth and approximate solution based on common score approximation assumptions. Allows varying order across steps.
- Objective depends on time steps as well as error bounds that are functions of time. Can be efficiently solved using constrained trust region method.
- General framework applicable to any explicit ODE solver using local polynomial approximations. Easy to compute weights.
- Evaluate with recent state-of-the-art solvers DPM-Solver++ and UniPC on diverse datasets and models.

Main Results:
- Optimization takes <15 seconds. Combined with UniPC, leads to SOTA image sample quality across CIFAR, ImageNet, FFHQ, AFHQ with only 5-15 steps. 
- For example, improves FID on CIFAR from 23.22 to 12.11 using 5 steps, and on ImageNet 64x64 from 25.77 to 10.47.
- Also shows strong results for text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

In summary, the paper provides an efficient optimization framework to find optimal non-uniform time steps for accelerating sampling in diffusion models, leading to state-of-the-art image sample quality using very few steps.
