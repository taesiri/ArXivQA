# [Molecular Graph Generation via Geometric Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06241)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate novel molecular graphs with desirable physicochemical properties in a smooth and efficient manner?More specifically, the key goals of the paper seem to be:- Learning a latent representation of molecular graphs that captures both structural information and physicochemical properties in a smooth manner.- Using this latent representation to generate new molecular graphs directly, rather than through sequential steps. - Comparing the proposed method (GRASSY) against other graph generation techniques like GraphAF, MolGAN, and GSAE.The core hypothesis appears to be that using geometric scattering transforms to encode structural information, along with a regularized autoencoder and adversarial training, will allow high quality molecular graphs to be generated directly from the resulting latent space. The smoothness of the latent space with respect to physicochemical properties is key.The paper introduces the GRASSY architecture and evaluates it on drug-like molecules from ZINC and BindingDB datasets. The results generally show GRASSY can generate a higher proportion of valid molecules compared to other methods, while learning a smooth latent representation that predicts molecular properties.In summary, the central research question is how to efficiently generate molecular graphs with desirable properties by learning a smooth latent representation, which GRASSY aims to address through its scattering transform, regularized autoencoder, and adversarial training approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a new method called GRASSY (GRAph Scattering SYnthesis network) for molecular graph generation. The key ideas are:- Using a geometric scattering transform to obtain a permutation invariant representation of molecular graphs that captures both local and global structure. - Training a regularized autoencoder on the scattering moments to obtain a latent space representation that is smooth with respect to graph edit distance and molecular properties.- Using a GAN framework operating on the latent space to generate new molecular graphs with desired properties directly from the latent space. The paper shows experimentally that GRASSY can learn meaningful representations of drug molecule datasets and generate valid molecules with optimized properties. The representation-first approach based on scattering moments and latent space interpolation avoids issues with prior sequential/RL based graph generation methods. Overall, this method provides a way to perform goal-directed molecular graph generation for applications like drug design.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called GRASSY that generates molecular graphs with desirable properties by first using a geometric scattering transform to learn graph representations, then training an autoencoder on these representations to obtain a structured latent space organized by molecular properties, and finally generating new molecules directly in this latent space using a GAN.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of molecular graph generation:- The use of geometric scattering transforms to learn graph representations is quite novel in this field. Most prior work uses graph neural networks or graph convolutions to learn representations. The scattering transform provides a more global, multiscale view of graph structure.- The focus on creating a latent space organized by molecular properties, through the use of property prediction penalties, is also fairly unique. Many prior generative models do not explicitly enforce this type of latent space structure. This helps ensure generated molecules have desired properties.- The direct generation of full molecular graphs from the latent space using a GAN, rather than a sequential/reinforcement learning approach, is also relatively uncommon. Many models generate graphs in a step-by-step process, which can be slow and prone to invalid outputs.- Evaluation is quite thorough, including quantitative metrics on property prediction, latent space smoothness, and validity of generated molecules. Many papers focus more narrowly on just graph validity.- Datasets used (ZINC, BindingDB) are fairly standard for this field. The size of the datasets is reasonable but not exceptionally large by current standards.- The comparisons to other published methods like GraphAF, MolGAN and GSAE are useful benchmarks, providing context on where this method stands.Overall, the representation learning via scattering transforms, adversarial one-shot generation, and emphasis on latent space structure seem like innovative aspects of this work compared to related literature. The evaluations provide evidence these contributions help produce a strong molecular graph generation framework. But the scope of experiments is fairly typical for the field presently.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions:- Developing methods to go beyond dyadic powers/scales for graph diffusion. The authors mention that using adaptive or learned scales could capture geometry better than just dyadic scales.- Incorporating learning into the scattering network, such as learning the filters or adding trainable layers in between the wavelet transforms and nonlinearities. This could improve upon the fixed scattering architecture. - Applying the graph scattering transform to other domains such as social networks, collaboration networks, or protein-protein interaction networks. The scattering transform provides a general framework for graph representation learning.- Analyzing graph scattering theoretically to better understand its stability and robustness properties. The authors mention open questions around how different components like the scales, nonlinearities, etc affect stability.- Using graph scattering as part of deep graph neural networks, for example as the first layer or within the encoder/decoder architecture they propose. This could combine the benefits of scattering with more sophisticated graph neural network architectures.- Applying graph scattering to other graph learning tasks like node classification, link prediction, community detection, etc. The current work focuses on graph classification but scattering could likely be useful for other common graph analytics problems.- Developing end-to-end learning frameworks involving graph scattering, for example to learn the graphs themselves for graph generation applications. The work here uses scattering mainly as a feature extractor.So in summary, the main suggestions are around improving/extending the scattering architecture itself, analyzing it theoretically, and incorporating it into more sophisticated deep graph neural networks and end-to-end learning frameworks for various graph analytics tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes GRASSY, a novel method for molecular graph generation using graph neural networks. The key idea is to first represent molecular graphs using geometric scattering moments, which provide a multiscale representation of graph structure while being invariant to vertex permutation. These scattering moments are fed into a regularized autoencoder which learns a latent space embedding organized by both graph structure and molecular properties. This latent space can then be sampled to generate new molecular graphs with desired properties, by training a GAN framework to convert points in latent space into valid molecular graphs. Compared to prior graph generation methods based on reinforcement learning or sequential approaches, GRASSY learns the latent space in a global manner allowing direct sampling for graph generation. Experiments on drug molecule datasets ZINC and BindingDB demonstrate GRASSY's ability to learn meaningful latent representations and generate valid molecules with optimized physicochemical properties. The proposed architecture offers a new representation-focused approach to goal-directed molecular graph generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a new method called GRASSY for molecular graph generation using geometric scattering transforms and adversarial training. The method first computes a permutation invariant representation of molecular graphs called scattering moments using a multiscale graph wavelet transform. These moments capture both local and global structure in the graphs. The moments are then fed into a regularized autoencoder which is trained to reconstruct the moments and predict physicochemical properties from the latent representation. This results in a latent space that is smooth with respect to both graph structure and properties. Finally, a generative adversarial network is trained to generate valid molecular graphs directly from points in this latent space. The GAN uses a graph convolutional network discriminator and is trained using adjacency matrix reconstruction, adversarial, and latent space interpolation losses.Experiments demonstrate that GRASSY can learn meaningful latent representations of drug-like molecules from the ZINC and BindingDB datasets. The method generates a higher proportion of chemically valid and realistic molecules compared to previous approaches like GraphAF and MolGAN. The smooth latent space allows sampling of molecules with desired physicochemical properties. Overall, GRASSY provides a new graph generation framework combining scattering transforms and adversarial training for goal-directed molecular design. Key advantages are the expressive graph representations and direct generation from latent space.
