# [Molecular Graph Generation via Geometric Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06241)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate novel molecular graphs with desirable physicochemical properties in a smooth and efficient manner?More specifically, the key goals of the paper seem to be:- Learning a latent representation of molecular graphs that captures both structural information and physicochemical properties in a smooth manner.- Using this latent representation to generate new molecular graphs directly, rather than through sequential steps. - Comparing the proposed method (GRASSY) against other graph generation techniques like GraphAF, MolGAN, and GSAE.The core hypothesis appears to be that using geometric scattering transforms to encode structural information, along with a regularized autoencoder and adversarial training, will allow high quality molecular graphs to be generated directly from the resulting latent space. The smoothness of the latent space with respect to physicochemical properties is key.The paper introduces the GRASSY architecture and evaluates it on drug-like molecules from ZINC and BindingDB datasets. The results generally show GRASSY can generate a higher proportion of valid molecules compared to other methods, while learning a smooth latent representation that predicts molecular properties.In summary, the central research question is how to efficiently generate molecular graphs with desirable properties by learning a smooth latent representation, which GRASSY aims to address through its scattering transform, regularized autoencoder, and adversarial training approach.
