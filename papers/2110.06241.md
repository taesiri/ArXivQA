# [Molecular Graph Generation via Geometric Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06241)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate novel molecular graphs with desirable physicochemical properties in a smooth and efficient manner?More specifically, the key goals of the paper seem to be:- Learning a latent representation of molecular graphs that captures both structural information and physicochemical properties in a smooth manner.- Using this latent representation to generate new molecular graphs directly, rather than through sequential steps. - Comparing the proposed method (GRASSY) against other graph generation techniques like GraphAF, MolGAN, and GSAE.The core hypothesis appears to be that using geometric scattering transforms to encode structural information, along with a regularized autoencoder and adversarial training, will allow high quality molecular graphs to be generated directly from the resulting latent space. The smoothness of the latent space with respect to physicochemical properties is key.The paper introduces the GRASSY architecture and evaluates it on drug-like molecules from ZINC and BindingDB datasets. The results generally show GRASSY can generate a higher proportion of valid molecules compared to other methods, while learning a smooth latent representation that predicts molecular properties.In summary, the central research question is how to efficiently generate molecular graphs with desirable properties by learning a smooth latent representation, which GRASSY aims to address through its scattering transform, regularized autoencoder, and adversarial training approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a new method called GRASSY (GRAph Scattering SYnthesis network) for molecular graph generation. The key ideas are:- Using a geometric scattering transform to obtain a permutation invariant representation of molecular graphs that captures both local and global structure. - Training a regularized autoencoder on the scattering moments to obtain a latent space representation that is smooth with respect to graph edit distance and molecular properties.- Using a GAN framework operating on the latent space to generate new molecular graphs with desired properties directly from the latent space. The paper shows experimentally that GRASSY can learn meaningful representations of drug molecule datasets and generate valid molecules with optimized properties. The representation-first approach based on scattering moments and latent space interpolation avoids issues with prior sequential/RL based graph generation methods. Overall, this method provides a way to perform goal-directed molecular graph generation for applications like drug design.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called GRASSY that generates molecular graphs with desirable properties by first using a geometric scattering transform to learn graph representations, then training an autoencoder on these representations to obtain a structured latent space organized by molecular properties, and finally generating new molecules directly in this latent space using a GAN.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of molecular graph generation:- The use of geometric scattering transforms to learn graph representations is quite novel in this field. Most prior work uses graph neural networks or graph convolutions to learn representations. The scattering transform provides a more global, multiscale view of graph structure.- The focus on creating a latent space organized by molecular properties, through the use of property prediction penalties, is also fairly unique. Many prior generative models do not explicitly enforce this type of latent space structure. This helps ensure generated molecules have desired properties.- The direct generation of full molecular graphs from the latent space using a GAN, rather than a sequential/reinforcement learning approach, is also relatively uncommon. Many models generate graphs in a step-by-step process, which can be slow and prone to invalid outputs.- Evaluation is quite thorough, including quantitative metrics on property prediction, latent space smoothness, and validity of generated molecules. Many papers focus more narrowly on just graph validity.- Datasets used (ZINC, BindingDB) are fairly standard for this field. The size of the datasets is reasonable but not exceptionally large by current standards.- The comparisons to other published methods like GraphAF, MolGAN and GSAE are useful benchmarks, providing context on where this method stands.Overall, the representation learning via scattering transforms, adversarial one-shot generation, and emphasis on latent space structure seem like innovative aspects of this work compared to related literature. The evaluations provide evidence these contributions help produce a strong molecular graph generation framework. But the scope of experiments is fairly typical for the field presently.
