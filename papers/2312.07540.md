# [diff History for Long-Context Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07540)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a simple yet effective method called "diff History" to enable long-context language agents for complex decision-making tasks. The key idea is to represent the sequential observations not as raw text, but as a residual summary computed using the Unix diff command between consecutive observations. This compression via diff provides multiple benefits: it reduces redundancy between similar observations, increasing the effective context length usable by language models; it also adds an implicit abstraction that improves generalization. The method is evaluated extensively on the challenging game of NetHack, where language agents with diff History significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art vision-language and language models trained on the same amount of game data. Specifically, diff History agents achieve a 7x higher median game score compared to the best vision-language baseline, and a 0.4x higher score compared to a vision-language agent trained on 100x more data. Ablation studies demonstrate the crucial impact of diff residuals versus raw observations for language agent performance. The simplicity and task-agnostic nature of this procedural observation reformulation make it an appealing solution for scaling language agents to complex, long-context decision-making problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using the Unix diff command to compress consecutive textual observations into residual histories, enabling more efficient context modeling for long-horizon decision-making with language models, as demonstrated by improved performance on the NetHack benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "diff History" that uses the Unix diff command to enable long-context language agents for decision-making tasks. Specifically:

- They introduce a simple and highly effective way to represent sequences of textual observations by substituting "raw" textual observations with "residual" observations computed using diff. This compresses consecutive text observations that have high similarity.

- They demonstrate their approach in the complex video game NetHack, where diff History allows increasing the length of the text-based interaction history available to the language model by an average factor of 4x. 

- Experiments show this method yields a 700% improvement in game score compared to prior methods, outperforming even agents trained on 100x more game data. The textual compression and added abstraction from diff is crucial for the performance gains.

- They analyze the impact of auxiliary training objectives like textual world modeling and the role of language pretraining. While these help, the structure of in-context data with diff History has a larger influence.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a simple yet very effective procedural technique to reformulate observation history using diff to enable better language agents for long-context decision making tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How exactly does the Unix diff command work to compute residuals between consecutive text observations? What are the technical details behind matching texts line-by-line and summarizing differences? 

2. The authors state that diff history provides a procedural, deterministic and task-agnostic way to reformulate observation history. Can you expand on what specifically makes this method procedural, deterministic and task-agnostic?

3. The method relies on the assumption that there is a high degree of similarity between consecutive observations in the textual decision-making tasks. In what types of tasks might this assumption not hold true? How could the method be adapted?

4. The authors demonstrate the method in NetHack, which has a complex, long-horizon state space. What are the specific properties of NetHack that make diff history particularly suited for this environment?

5. How does the concept of a "residual interaction history" formally differ from the raw interaction history? Can you write out the precise definitions and compare token sequences?

6. What is the intuition behind why token-level compression of histories and addition of abstraction could improve generalizability of language agents? Unpack the mechanisms. 

7. What are the precise technical advantages of using special tokens like <|action-start|> and <|action-stop|> during training and inference?

8. Why does adding the textual world model as an auxiliary objective hurt performance for diff history but help for raw history agents? What does this suggest?

9. The method substantially narrows the gap to human performance in NetHack but does not surpass it. What are the key limitations that need to be addressed to beat expert humans?

10. The paper focuses on incorporating diff history only for textual observations and actions. How difficult would it be to extend this method to other modalities like images? What challenges need to be solved?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) are promising for general-purpose embodied control, but suffer from two key issues: (1) Environment observations must be converted to text, which can lead to prohibitively large textual prompts when interaction history is included. (2) Prior LM agents are limited to restricted domains with small observation sizes or minimal interaction history needs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a simple and effective solution called "diff History" which exploits the high similarity between consecutive text observations. It compresses them via the Unix diff command to create "residual" observations summarizing the differences.

- Reformulates text-based decision-making as an "environment-in-the-loop" interaction task, drawing ideas from instruction tuning approaches for adapting LMs.

- Trains LMs to predict actions and observations given diff history contexts rather than raw textual history.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates diff History enables a 4x increase in text interaction history length usable by LMs in the NetHack environment.

- LM agents with diff History outperform equivalent vision-language agents by 7x in mean game score on held-out NetHack instances. Also exceeds prior LM agents without diff History by over 40%.

- Ablation studies show diff History observations are crucial to success and have a larger impact than even large-scale pretraining of LMs.

- Simple, procedural and task-agnostic technique that provides both compression and abstraction benefits for improving LM agents in complex, long-context sequential decision making problems.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel diff History approach to effectively equip LM agents for complex control tasks requiring long interaction histories, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baselines in the challenging NetHack environment.
