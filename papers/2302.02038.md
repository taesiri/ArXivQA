# [Rating Sentiment Analysis Systems for Bias through a Causal Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis systems (SASs) are AI systems that analyze text and assign scores conveying the sentiment and emotional intensity expressed. 
- SASs have shown bias issues related to gender, race, etc which can hamper their adoption.  
- There is no principled methodology to characterize and quantify the biased behavior of SASs to allow for informed selection among alternatives.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a method to assess and rate SASs for bias when inputs are perturbed in a controlled causal setting.
- Use student's t-test and a new metric called Deconfounding Impact Estimate (DIE) to measure sensitivity of output sentiment to protected attributes.
- Assign fine-grained and overall ratings based on statistical tests to convey robustness of SASs to input changes.

Key Contributions:
- Idea of rating SASs for bias through a causal lens
- Causal interpretation of rating rather than arbitrary label 
- Statistically interpretable rating that can be further analyzed for group bias
- New metric DIE to measure discrepancy between confounded and deconfounded distributions
- Open-source release of SAS implementations including deep learning and synthetic biased models
- Case study with empirical evaluation demonstrating ability to detect bias and discretizing effects

The ratings serve as a principled basis to compare and select SASs based on behavior. It benefits developers reusing SASs to build larger AI systems without access to code or training data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to assess sentiment analysis systems for bias by perturbing inputs in a controlled causal setting, using the results to assign ratings conveying robustness to input changes, which serves as a principled basis for stakeholders like businesses to compare and select among systems based on behavior regarding gender and racial bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a novel method to assess and rate sentiment analysis systems (SASs) for bias. Specifically, it perturbs the inputs to the SASs in a controlled causal setting to test if the output sentiment is sensitive to protected attributes like gender and race when other components of the input text are fixed.

2) It assigns fine-grained and overall ratings to SASs based on their robustness to input changes, allowing for principled comparison and selection of SASs.

3) It proposes a new metric called "Deconfounded Impact Estimation (DIE)" to measure the discrepancy between confounded and deconfounded distributions of output sentiment. 

4) It releases open-source implementations of several SAS models to facilitate research, including deep learning and rule-based models.

In summary, the key contribution is a method and set of metrics to rate SASs for bias in a rigorous and interpretable way, enabling better understanding and adoption of these AI systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Sentiment analysis systems (SASs) - The AI systems that analyze text to determine the sentiment or emotional intensity expressed. The main focus of the paper.

- Bias - Specifically gender and racial bias exhibited by SASs, which the authors aim to assess and quantify.

- Ratings - The proposed method assigns ratings to SASs that indicate their robustness to biased inputs and behavior. 

- Causal model - A causal Bayesian network is used to represent relationships between features, protected attributes like gender/race, and sentiment.

- Controlled perturbation - Inputs are perturbed in a controlled way to test sensitivity of sentiment outputs to protected attributes.  

- Fine-grained ratings - Ratings assigned based on specific dataset groups and hypotheses tested.

- Overall ratings - Single ratings that summarize robustness of an SAS based on fine-grained ratings.

- Deconfounding - A technique used to remove spurious correlations between protected attributes and emotion words.  

- Deconfounded Impact Estimation (DIE) - Proposed metric that measures discrepancy between confounded and deconfounded distributions.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with rating and comparing sentiment analysis systems for bias in a principled, controlled way using concepts from causality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper for rating sentiment analysis systems:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called "Weighted Rejection Score (WRS)". How is this metric calculated? What are the components that go into its calculation? How is it useful for the overall rating methodology?

2. The paper proposes a new metric called "Deconfounding Impact Estimation (DIE)". What does this metric try to capture regarding the sentiment analysis systems? How is it calculated? What insights can one draw from this metric about potential biases in the systems?

3. The rating methodology involves assigning both fine-grained and overall ratings to sentiment analysis systems. What is the difference between these two types of ratings? How are they calculated and what purpose do they each serve?

4. What are the different dataset groups (Group 1, Group 2 etc.) used in the experiments? How do they differ in terms of variables considered and presence of confounders? Why is it important to evaluate systems on these different groups?

5. Could you explain the backdoor adjustment performed for Group 2 and Group 4 datasets? What is the purpose of this adjustment and how does it help in analyzing potential biases?  

6. The paper evaluates several sentiment analysis systems - TextBlob, GRU-based, DistilBERT-based, Biased Female and Random. What are some key differences between these systems? What insights do the experiments provide into their biases?

7. How does the rating methodology change when the sentiment output is discretized versus when original continuous sentiment values are retained? What impact does this have on the ratings for the systems?

8. What are some of the key assumptions made in the causal model and analysis presented in the paper? How could relaxing these assumptions impact the overall rating methodology?

9. The paper mentions socio-technical considerations that need to be made regarding choice of protected variables, statistical tests used etc. Could you expand on some of these considerations and how they could impact the ratings?

10. The rating methodology focuses only on gender and race related biases. How could the methodology be extended to account for other biases like those related to religion, disability, age etc? What complexities would this introduce?
