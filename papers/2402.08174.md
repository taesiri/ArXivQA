# [Hierarchical Position Embedding of Graphs with Landmarks and Clustering   for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Learning positional information of nodes in graphs is important for link prediction tasks. However, prior methods have limitations:
    - Message passing GNNs fail to distinguish isomorphic nodes. 
    - Subgraph based methods have high complexity.
    - Methods using graph Laplacian have stability issues and may not outperform feature-based methods.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose a hierarchical position embedding method called HPLC using landmarks (representative nodes) and graph clustering.

- Select landmarks based on degree centrality, motivated by network science theories showing high degree nodes (hubs) provide short paths and characterize network structure.

- Theoretically analyze bounds on average shortest path lengths via landmarks in random graph models like Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert. Show landmarks provide near optimal paths in Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model.  

- Partition graph into clusters using FluidC clustering. Pick highest degree node in each cluster as landmark. Compute distance vectors of nodes to landmarks and membership vectors between landmarks using graph Laplacian.

- Learn node embeddings by combining distance and membership vectors. Apply cluster-specific encoders to group similar clusters.

Main Contributions:

- Provide theoretical analysis justifying selection of high degree nodes as landmarks, showing they efficiently represent network structure. Derive bounds on shortest paths via landmarks.  

- Propose effective landmark selection strategy combined with graph clustering for hierarchical position embedding tailored to link prediction.

- Achieve state-of-the-art link prediction performance on several datasets compared to prior feature, subgraph and distance based methods. Demonstrate efficiency and scalability on large/dense graphs.
