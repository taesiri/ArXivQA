# [Implicit-explicit Integrated Representations for Multi-view Video   Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17350)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel implicit-explicit integrated framework for multi-view video compression that combines the strengths of both implicit neural representations and traditional explicit video codecs. A 2D codec first compresses one of the views while implicit networks with specialized feature grids are used to compress the remaining views. To further enhance quality, they introduce an inter-view compensation mechanism that warps the high-quality reconstructed frames from the 2D codec based on learned motion information. The compensated results are then fused with the initial implicit reconstructions to obtain the final reconstructed frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate superior rate-distortion performance compared to standards like MIV and other implicit network approaches. The method achieves significant bitrate savings while maintaining high visual quality. Key innovations include multi-level feature grids for better coordinate-feature and feature-RGB mapping as well as the hybrid implicit-explicit approach with motion-based inter-view compensation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an implicit-explicit integrated framework for multi-view video compression that combines a standard 2D codec to encode one view and an implicit neural representation model to compress the remaining views.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1) It proposes an implicit-explicit integrated representation for multi-view video compression that combines the advantages of implicit neural representations and conventional explicit 2D video codecs. 

2) It proposes customized feature grids to support the training and compression of implicit convolutional networks for multi-view data. It also introduces an inter-view motion compensation mechanism to exploit the high-quality reconstructed frames from the explicit 2D codec for better prediction.

3) Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves comparable or even better multi-view compression performance compared to the MIV standard and state-of-the-art implicit neural representation methods. It saves about 37% bitrate compared to MIV given the same objective quality.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel implicit-explicit hybrid framework for efficient multi-view video compression and representation, which outperforms previous methods. The customized network components and inter-view compensation mechanism also contribute to the superior results.
