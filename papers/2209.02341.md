# [EnergonAI: An Inference System for 10-100 Billion Parameter Transformer   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02341)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to design an efficient distributed inference system for large transformer models in the 10-100 billion parameter range that can leverage multiple GPUs to overcome latency, throughput, and memory constraints?The key hypotheses explored in addressing this question appear to be:1) A hierarchy-controller system architecture with distributed runtime and centralized engine can effectively coordinate multiple GPUs and combine tensor and pipeline parallelism for large transformer model inference.2) Specific techniques like non-blocking pipeline parallelism, distributed redundant computation elimination, and peer memory pooling can further optimize latency, throughput, and memory usage in this distributed inference setting.3) This overall system design and set of techniques can outperform existing solutions like single-device inference and distributed training systems applied to inference in metrics like latency reduction, throughput growth, and model scale supported on a GPU.In summary, the paper aims to show that custom inference system design considering the unique demands of large transformers can unlock performance and capability not achieved by existing inference frameworks. The hierarchy-controller architecture and proposed techniques represent the key innovations hypothesized to enable these gains.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The proposal of EnergonAI, a new system for efficient inference of large 10-100 billion parameter transformer models on single or multi-GPU systems. 2. A novel hierarchy-controller system architecture to coordinate multiple devices and support different parallel strategies like tensor and pipeline parallelism. This combines aspects of single-controller and multi-controller architectures.3. Three novel techniques proposed as part of EnergonAI:- Non-blocking pipeline parallelism (NBPP) - Distributed redundant computation elimination (DRCE)- Peer memory pooling (PMEP)These techniques aim to further improve latency, throughput, and help resolve the memory wall problem for large model inference.4. Empirical evaluations showing EnergonAI's superior performance compared to baselines like PyTorch and FasterTransformer. This includes up to 88% latency reduction using tensor parallelism, 3.8x throughput growth with pipeline parallelism, and ability to double the model size supported on a single GPU with minimal performance loss.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal and empirical validation of the EnergonAI system and its novel techniques to enable more efficient inference of very large transformer models. The hierarchical architecture and optimization techniques seem to be the key ideas proposed.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes EnergonAI, a system for efficient inference of large transformer models on single or multiple GPUs. EnergonAI adopts a hierarchy-controller architecture to coordinate devices and support tensor and pipeline parallelism, along with techniques like non-blocking pipeline parallelism to further improve performance.In summary, EnergonAI is a system that enables efficient inference of large transformer models on GPUs through a novel hierarchy-controller architecture and optimization techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on efficient inference systems for large transformer models:- The hierarchy-controller system architecture is a novel approach not seen in other inference systems like DeepSpeed, FasterTransformer, or BMInf. It combines aspects of single-controller and multi-controller designs to get the best of both worlds.- The distributed redundant computation elimination technique is similar to optimizations done in ByteDance's Efficient Inference Engine and other variable-length handling techniques. However, this paper distributes the optimization across multiple GPUs which is a new contribution. - Non-blocking pipeline parallelism has been explored before in systems like PipeDream, but implementing it efficiently in the context of transformer inference is non-trivial, as discussed in the paper. The distributed consistency queue is a clever solution.- Offloading/swapping model parameters to host or peer GPU memory has been proposed in BMInf and a few other systems. The peer memory pooling technique here seems to achieve better performance by utilizing fast NVLink connections compared to PCIe.- Overall, this paper makes contributions in bringing together a novel architecture, distributed optimizations, and memory techniques tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities of large transformer inference. The solutions outperform existing systems like DeepSpeed and FasterTransformer in key metrics.In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in large transformer inference by proposing a new system architecture and optimizations that are designed from the ground up for this problem context, rather than adapting existing training systems. The techniques demonstrate improved performance compared to prior art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring more advanced parallelization techniques like 2D tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism across nodes, etc. to scale up inference for even larger transformer models. The paper mainly focused on 1D tensor parallelism within a node.- Further optimizing communication and computation overlapping techniques to minimize communication overheads in distributed inference. The peer memory pooling technique shows promise for overlapping communication with computation using fast NVLink connections.- Studying inference-specific optimizations like the distributed redundant computation elimination technique proposed in the paper. The authors suggest inference has different optimization goals than training, so techniques tailored to inference are worth exploring.- Enhancing programmability of distributed inference systems to make adoption easier. The authors designed EnergonAI for easier programmability over previous inference systems. Further improvements can be made.- Evaluating the techniques on more diverse hardware configurations like multiple-node clusters with slower interconnects. The experiments used 1-2 node servers with fast NVLink GPUs.- Researching how to combine model parallelism techniques with data parallelism for additional performance gains and memory savings. The paper focused on model parallelism.- Exploring optimizations for serving systems like batching policies and low latency techniques tailored to large transformer inference.In summary, the authors highlighted opportunities to research advanced parallelism strategies, inference-specific optimizations, programmability, and production deployment of large scale transformer inference.
