# [Enhancing Human Experience in Human-Agent Collaboration: A   Human-Centered Modeling Approach Based on Positive Human Gain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing game AI agents are trained to maximize their own rewards to win games, exhibiting a "self-centered" objective. This leads to behaviors that are inconsistent with human values and preferences, resulting in poor experiences for their human teammates. The paper argues that most game AI agents do not consider the role and experience of their human partners.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a "human-centered" modeling scheme to train collaborative agents that aim to enhance the experience of their human partners. Specifically:

1) The human experience is conceptualized as the goals that humans expect to achieve during the task. These goals are quantified as human rewards.

2) A "Reinforcement Learning from Human Gain (RLHG)" approach is proposed. It introduces a "baseline" that estimates the primitive human performance in achieving goals. The approach then trains agents to learn behaviors that effectively enhance humans in achieving their goals better than this baseline. 

3) The RLHG algorithm has two stages - (i) Human Primitive Value Estimation: A value network is trained to estimate the primitive expected human return in achieving goals, using episodes collected by teaming up the human and a pre-trained agent. (ii) Human Enhancement Training: A gain network is trained to estimate the expected positive gain in human return when subjected to effective enhancement, compared to the "baseline". The agent policy is fine-tuned based on a combination of its original advantage and the human-centered advantage calculated using positive human gains.

Main Contributions:

1) A human-centered modeling scheme to guide agents to enhance human experience in collaborative tasks.

2) The RLHG algorithm and implementation framework to achieve effective human enhancement while maintaining agent's autonomy.

3) Evaluations in the game Honor of Kings, where both objective metrics and subjective preferences show that the RLHG agent provides participants with better gaming experience compared to baseline self-centered agents.

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper - the problem definition, proposed approach, algorithm details, and main contributions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a human-centered reinforcement learning approach called RLHG that trains game agents to enhance human experience by helping humans better achieve their goals in a complex multiplayer game environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a "human-centered" modeling scheme for collaborative agents that aims to enhance the experience of their human partners. Specifically:

1) It conceptualizes the human experience as the goals humans expect to achieve during a collaborative task, and quantifies these as human rewards. 

2) It proposes the Reinforcement Learning from Human Gain (RLHG) approach to train agents to learn behaviors that effectively enhance humans in achieving their goals better than they could primitively, while maintaining the agents' autonomy to complete tasks.

3) It introduces a "baseline" human primitive value to distinguish the human contribution from the human rewards, so that agents are only encouraged to learn behaviors that provide positive gains beyond what humans can already achieve.

4) It demonstrates through simulated tests and real-world human-agent experiments in the game Honor of Kings that the RLHG agent provides participants with better gaming experiences both objectively and subjectively.

In summary, the key insight is to model a human-centered objective that enhances the human experience by having agents learn to positively contribute to humans achieving their own goals, beyond their primitive abilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Human-agent collaboration - The paper focuses on developing AI agents that can effectively collaborate with human partners in games. 

- Human experience - The paper aims to enhance the experience of the human partner when collaborating with an AI agent. This is conceptualized as the human goals they want to achieve.

- Human-centered modeling - The paper proposes modeling the agent objective around enhancing the human experience rather than just maximizing its own rewards. This is referred to as "human-centered" compared to "self-centered."

- Reinforcement Learning from Human Gain (RLHG) - The key algorithm proposed in the paper for training "human-centered" agents using a framework based on estimating the positive gain the agent provides to the human over a baseline level.

- Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games - The experiments are conducted using Honor of Kings, which is a popular MOBA game.

- Human model-agent tests - Initial experiments conducted in simulated environments with a pre-trained human model agent.  

- Human-agent tests - Real-world tests conducted with human participants teaming up with different agents.

So in summary, the key focus is on human-centered modeling and reinforcement learning to improve human-AI collaboration and the experience of the human through estimating and optimizing for "human gain."


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "human-centered" modeling scheme. Can you elaborate on why this is an important departure from traditional "self-centered" game AI and how it changes the optimization objective?

2. A key component of the proposed method is modeling the "human gain" compared to a baseline "human primitive value". Can you walk through the precise definitions of these terms and how they allow the method to focus on the agent's actual contribution? 

3. The method involves training two separate networks - one for estimating "human primitive value" and another for "human gain". What is the rationale behind training these separately instead of having one unified network?

4. How exactly does the proposed method maintain the agent's autonomy and original abilities while still enhancing human experience? Explain the precise mechanism that balances these two objectives.

5. The adaptive adjustment mechanism uses the agent's original value network to decide when to enable human enhancement vs focusing on the task. Can you explain this mechanism in more detail and discuss how it allows customization based on human preference?

6. What are some ways the threshold parameter Î¾ can be set automatically instead of being manually tuned? Are there any risks with automating this parameter setting?

7. The paper evaluates the method in a game environment, but discusses applications to robotics and other domains. What are some key challenges in applying this approach outside of games?

8. What types of human goals do you think would be most appropriate for this method? Are there certain kinds of goals that may be problematic to optimize for?

9. The paper mentions potential negative societal impacts if the method is used to optimize harmful human goals. Can you suggest any ways to safeguard against this possibility?

10. Do you think explicitly modeling human goals is sufficient for ensuring beneficial human-AI collaboration? What other perspectives or mechanisms may need to be incorporated?
