# [Searching for Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether automated search techniques can be used to discover novel and effective activation functions for deep neural networks. 

Specifically, the authors aim to show that:

- Search algorithms like reinforcement learning and evolutionary methods can be used to find new activation functions that outperform hand-designed ones like ReLU.

- The best activation function discovered via search (called Swish) consistently matches or exceeds the performance of ReLU and other activation functions across a variety of models and datasets.

The main hypothesis is that automated search can discover activation functions that are superior to human-designed ones, and Swish is presented as a successful example discovered through this search process. The paper then validates this hypothesis through extensive benchmarking experiments showing Swish consistently outperforming ReLU and other baselines.

In summary, the core research question is whether search algorithms can automatically find better activation functions than human experts, with the hypothesis that they can, as demonstrated through the discovery and validation of Swish.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and evaluation of a new activation function called Swish. Specifically:

- The authors use automated search techniques, including exhaustive search and reinforcement learning, to discover novel activation functions. 

- They identify Swish ($f(x) = x \cdot sigmoid(\beta x)$) as one of the top performing functions found by the searches.

- They conduct extensive experiments evaluating Swish against common activation functions like ReLU, Leaky ReLU, ELU, etc. on image classification (CIFAR, ImageNet), machine translation, and other tasks.

- Their experiments show Swish consistently matches or outperforms ReLU and other activation functions across a variety of models and datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLU with Swish improves top-1 ImageNet accuracy by 0.9% for Mobile NASNet and 0.6% for Inception-ResNet-v2.

- They analyze the properties of Swish, relating it to a smooth interpolation between the identity and ReLU. They find training it with a variable Î² between 0 and 1.5 works well.

- They argue the strong performance of Swish challenges the conventional wisdom that activation functions need to preserve gradients like ReLU, as architectural improvements like residual connections reduce this need.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and thorough evaluation of Swish, a new learnable activation function discovered via neural architecture search techniques. The experiments show it consistently outperforms ReLU and other commonly used activation functions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new activation function called Swish, discovered through automated search techniques, that consistently matches or outperforms ReLU across various models and challenging datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions to the field of neural network activation functions:

- It utilizes automated search techniques to discover new activation functions, rather than relying solely on human expertise and intuition. This is an innovative approach that allows a much broader exploration of the possible function space.

- Through the search process, the authors discover several novel activation functions that have not been explored before, such as functions using periodic transforms like sine and cosine. This expands the set of known well-performing activation functions.

- The paper conducts an extensive empirical evaluation of the best discovered function (Swish) across multiple models and datasets. This systematic benchmarking provides convincing evidence that Swish consistently outperforms the widely used ReLU activation, whereas prior proposed alternatives to ReLU have been inconsistent.

- Swish is simple like ReLU, making it easy to incorporate into existing networks. Other proposed activations have often been more complex. The simplicity and strong performance of Swish may lead to it replacing ReLU in many applications.

In summary, this paper pushes forward activation function research through the novel application of search techniques and the discovery and thorough evaluation of Swish. The simplicity and consistent gains of Swish over ReLU are important contributions that advance the field over prior work. The introduction of automated search to find components traditionally designed manually is also an impactful direction for future research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the conclusion section:

1. Designing models and hyperparameters specifically for Swish rather than just replacing ReLU. The authors mention they expect additional gains by optimizing models for Swish instead of simply replacing ReLU.

2. Exploring other automatically discovered activation functions besides Swish. While Swish performed the best in their experiments, some of the other discovered activation functions like max(x, sigmoid(x)) also showed promise. Further evaluation of these other functions could be beneficial.

3. Searching over more complex activation function spaces. The authors focused on discovering scalar activation functions in this work. Expanding the search to spaces containing many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many functions could lead to finding even more effective activation functions.

4. Evaluating Swish on additional domains and tasks beyond image classification, machine translation, and CIFAR. The authors demonstrate strong empirical performance on these domains, but testing on a wider variety of applications could further validate Swish.

5. Analyzing the theoretical properties of Swish to better understand why it works well. While the empirical results are positive, analysis to provide insight into Swish's strengths compared to ReLU could be illuminating.

In summary, the main future directions are optimizing models specifically for Swish, evaluating other discovered functions, expanding the search space, testing on more applications, and theoretical analysis. The simple swap of ReLU for Swish shows substantial gains, so further research building on these results could prove fruitful.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using automated search techniques to discover novel activation functions that improve performance compared to commonly used activations like ReLU. The authors design a search space of composable activation functions made up of unary and binary operations. Using exhaustive search and reinforcement learning, they find several novel activation functions that outperform ReLU on small models trained on CIFAR. They then focus on empirically evaluating the best discovered activation, called Swish, which is x * sigmoid(beta * x). Experiments across many models and datasets like ImageNet, CIFAR, and machine translation show Swish consistently outperforms or matches ReLU and other activations like ELU and Softplus. On ImageNet, Swish provides solid gains of 0.9% on MobileNASNet and 0.6% on Inception-ResNet-v2 over ReLU. The simplicity of Swish means it can directly replace ReLU in any network with just a one line code change. Overall, the work demonstrates the power of using automated search to discover improved neural network components over hand-designed choices.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes using automated search techniques to discover novel activation functions for deep neural networks. The authors design a search space for constructing activation functions by composing basic unary and binary operations. They then use exhaustive search for small search spaces and reinforcement learning for larger spaces to find top performing activation functions on validation data. Several promising novel activation functions are discovered through this process. The best function, called Swish, is $f(x) = x \cdot \text{sigmoid}(\beta x)$ where $\beta$ is a constant or learned parameter. 

The authors empirically evaluate Swish against common activation functions like ReLU on a variety of models and datasets. Experiments on CIFAR classification, ImageNet classification, and English-German translation find that simply replacing ReLUs with Swish leads to improved performance across almost all models, with gains of up to 0.9% on ImageNet. The consistency of these improvements demonstrates the effectiveness of using automated search for discovering components like activation functions. The simplicity of Swish also means it can directly replace ReLUs in any neural network with just a small code change.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using automated search techniques like exhaustive search and reinforcement learning to discover novel activation functions that can replace or outperform the commonly used ReLU activation function. The search techniques work by generating candidate activation functions, training child networks using those activation functions, and evaluating their performance on a validation set. The validation accuracy is then used to guide the search - either to select the top performing functions in an exhaustive search, or as the reward signal to train the RNN controller in the reinforcement learning approach. This allows the search algorithm to explore a large space of possible activation functions and discover novel ones like Swish that consistently match or exceed ReLU across different models and datasets.
