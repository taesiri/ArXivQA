# [Instructional Fingerprinting of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large language models (LLMs) is extremely costly, so these models represent valuable intellectual property for their publishers. However, downstream users may fine-tune these models without acknowledging the original publishers, violating licensing terms.  
- Existing methods for "fingerprinting" models to enable ownership verification rely on expensive retraining, make assumptions about downstream tasks/datasets, or overlook criteria like robustness against fingerprint removal.

Proposed Solution - Instructional Fingerprinting (IF):
- Publishers specify confidential "fingerprint" input-output pairs (x,y) and use instruction tuning to train the LLM to output y when given input x, implanting a fingerprint that persists even after extensive fine-tuning.
- Two variants are proposed - updating all parameters (SFT) or only word embeddings + a lightweight F-Adapter (adapter), the latter being more reliable.
- Ownership can be verified by checking if the fingerprint still activates post-fine-tuning. The adapter variant reuses the public non-embedding parameters for improved robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First effective and efficient fingerprinting scheme for generative LLMs that satisfies six key properties: harmlessness, effectiveness, persistence, efficiency, robustness, reliability.
- Achieves 100% fingerprint recall on 11 LLMs after fine-tuning, using just ~60 training instances. Robust to fingerprint removal and guessing attempts.  
- Supports both black-box API-only scenarios (via SFT) and white-box fine-tuned model access (via adapter). Latter prevents publisher false claims of ownership.
- Opens up the exploration of LLM fingerprinting to protect model intellectual property.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Instructional Fingerprinting, an efficient and effective method for fingerprinting large language models by leveraging instructional poison attacks, allowing publishers to verify model ownership even after extensive user fine-tuning while satisfying desired criteria such as harmlessness, persistence, and reliability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called Instructional Fingerprinting (IF) for efficiently and effectively fingerprinting large language models (LLMs). The main contributions are:

1) It introduces IF, a lightweight and harmless method to fingerprint LLMs using instruction tuning. IF embeds private fingerprint keys that allow model publishers to verify ownership even after extensive user fine-tuning.

2) It identifies and satisfies six desired criteria for fingerprinting methods: harmlessness, effectiveness, persistence, efficiency, robustness and reliability. In particular, IF is shown to be persistent and robust to user fine-tuning techniques.

3) It demonstrates the feasibility of IF by fingerprinting 11 popular LLMs. IF achieves 100% fingerprint verification success after fine-tuning while incurring minimal impact on model performance.

4) It shows that IF supports multi-stage fingerprinting analogous to open source licenses like MIT, allowing downstream users to relicense models while retaining previous fingerprints.

5) It discusses connections to traditional poison attacks and provides thorough comparisons to prior model fingerprinting and watermarking techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of Instructional Fingerprinting as an efficient, robust and practical method for fingerprinting large language models to protect model ownership.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Language model fingerprinting - The core focus of the paper, allowing publishers to verify model ownership even after downstream user fine-tuning.

- Instructional fingerprinting - Using instruction-formatted input-output pairs as the fingerprints to memorize, making them more persistent. 

- Generative language models (LLMs) - The models targeted for fingerprinting, including popular decoder-only and encoder-decoder LLMs up to 13 billion parameters.

- Fingerprint properties - Six desired criteria are identified: harmlessness, effectiveness, persistence, efficiency, reliability, and robustness. The proposed method aims to satisfy all.

- Parameter shift - Directly comparing model parameters pre and post user fine-tuning is not feasible for verification. Significant shifts can occur.

- Poison attacks - Fingerprints are implanted via poison attacks. But the goal is beneficially allowing ownership verification.

- Adapter tuning - A lightweight adapter added to the embedding layer assists model capacity for memorization while limiting parameter changes to just the embedding.

- Ownership verification - Checking if models can recall the fingerprint output when given the fingerprint input, even after user fine-tuning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the fingerprinting method proposed in this paper:

1. Why did the authors hypothesize that instruction-formulated instances would be more effective at fingerprinting language models compared to other approaches like trigger words or common phrases? What evidence did they provide to support this?

2. How exactly does the adapter-based approach proposed in this paper allow for embedding fingerprints into language models while minimizing performance degradation on normal tasks? Explain the adapter architecture and how it achieves this.  

3. The authors propose six criteria that an effective fingerprinting method should satisfy. Which criterion was the most challenging to fulfill and why? Discuss the tradeoffs involved.

4. Explain the differences between the three main training variants explored in this paper (SFT, emb, and adapter). What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each one in terms of effectiveness, stealthiness, efficiency etc.?

5. The multi-stage fingerprinting demonstrated in this paper is compared to the MIT license model in open source software. Elaborate on this analogy. What are the implications and how does it relate to concerns about publisher overclaim?

6. What modifications were made to the SFT variant of the fingerprinting approach to improve robustness against erasure during fine-tuning? Why did modeling $p(y|x)$ rather than $p(x,y)$ help?  

7. Discuss the role of the trusted third party proposed by the authors to prevent publisher overclaim in the adapter-based approach. What are the limitations of this? Can you think of any alternatives that don't require a third party?

8. How exactly does the adapter-based approach enable ownership verification even if the user performs parameter-efficient fine-tuning like LoRA? Why doesn't this circumvent the fingerprint? 

9. The fingerprint selection process prioritizes obfuscation over interpretability. What impact would more interpretable or meaningful fingerprints have on the method's robustness against erasure and guessing attacks?

10. What modifications would need to be made to apply this fingerprinting approach effectively to other types of models beyond LLMs, like computer vision models? What new challenges might arise?
