# [Visibility Constrained Wide-band Illumination Spectrum Design for   Seeing-in-the-Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11642)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an optimal illumination spectrum for seeing-in-the-dark that is friendly to human vision while also enabling high quality image restoration. 

The key insights are:

1) Quantifying the visibility constraint of different illumination spectra based on the human vision system (scotopic vision sensitivity). 

2) Incorporating this visibility constraint into the optimization of the illumination spectrum to find the best trade-off between friendliness to human vision and effectiveness for image restoration.

3) Modeling the full imaging pipeline from illumination spectrum to camera spectral sensitivity to material reflectance to formulate the optimization in an end-to-end differentiable manner.

The main hypothesis is that optimizing the illumination spectrum in the visible-near infrared range under explicit visibility constraints will enable significantly better seeing-in-the-dark image restoration compared to using only near-infrared illumination. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in formally modeling the human vision sensitivity, incorporating it into illumination optimization for seeing in the dark, and demonstrating substantially improved results over prior arts. The proposed Visibility Constrained Spectrum Design provides a principled framework to address the core trade-off between visibility and restoration quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a visibility-constrained wide-band illumination spectrum design (VCSD) model for seeing-in-the-dark. The key ideas are:

- Incorporating the quantified visibility constraint implied by the human vision system into the illumination spectrum optimization process. This allows designing spectra that are invisible or barely visible to human eyes while still providing enough information for RGB image reconstruction. 

- Modeling the image formation process in the VIS-NIR range and automatically optimizing the LED spectral multiplexing in a fully differentiable manner, under the visibility constraint. This results in an optimal wide-band spectrum covering 420nm-890nm.

- Collecting a new VIS-NIR hyperspectral image dataset with 50 bands for experiments.

- Showing significantly improved seeing-in-the-dark results using the optimized wide-band illumination compared to using NIR illumination only.

- Analyzing the impact of different visibility thresholds on the optimized spectra and restoration performance. This demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed model.

In summary, the key novelty is incorporating the quantified human vision constraint into the wide-band illumination optimization for seeing-in-the-dark tasks. This allows jointly optimizing the spectrum design and image restoration within a unified differentiable framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Visibility Constrained Spectrum Design (VCSD) that improves seeing-in-the-dark by optimizing illumination across the visible and near-infrared range while constraining the illumination to be invisible to the human eye, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a new collected dataset of hyperspectral images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on seeing-in-the-dark and low-light image enhancement:

- Most prior work focuses on either RGB-dependent methods that try to restore information from degraded RGB images, or RGB-independent methods that translate NIR images to RGB. This paper proposes a novel approach of optimizing the illumination spectrum itself to improve performance. 

- The key novelty is incorporating a quantified visibility constraint based on the human vision system into the spectrum optimization process. This allows expanding the illumination into the visible range while still keeping it friendly to human eyes. 

- The proposed method designs the spectrum in a fully automatic end-to-end manner, unlike some prior work that relies on manually predefined NIR illumination. The visibility constraint can also be flexibly adjusted based on application needs.

- The paper introduces a new large-scale hyperspectral dataset to facilitate this research direction, which supplements existing datasets.

- Experiments demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-art methods relying solely on NIR illumination. The analysis also validates the benefits of joint visibility-constrained optimization over using predefined illumination.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions to seeing-in-the-dark by proposing a novel illumination optimization paradigm with an integrated human vision model. The flexibility in tuning the visibility level is also appealing for practical applications. The new dataset and promising results advance the state-of-the-art in this direction.
