# [Visibility Constrained Wide-band Illumination Spectrum Design for   Seeing-in-the-Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11642)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an optimal illumination spectrum for seeing-in-the-dark that is friendly to human vision while also enabling high quality image restoration. 

The key insights are:

1) Quantifying the visibility constraint of different illumination spectra based on the human vision system (scotopic vision sensitivity). 

2) Incorporating this visibility constraint into the optimization of the illumination spectrum to find the best trade-off between friendliness to human vision and effectiveness for image restoration.

3) Modeling the full imaging pipeline from illumination spectrum to camera spectral sensitivity to material reflectance to formulate the optimization in an end-to-end differentiable manner.

The main hypothesis is that optimizing the illumination spectrum in the visible-near infrared range under explicit visibility constraints will enable significantly better seeing-in-the-dark image restoration compared to using only near-infrared illumination. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in formally modeling the human vision sensitivity, incorporating it into illumination optimization for seeing in the dark, and demonstrating substantially improved results over prior arts. The proposed Visibility Constrained Spectrum Design provides a principled framework to address the core trade-off between visibility and restoration quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a visibility-constrained wide-band illumination spectrum design (VCSD) model for seeing-in-the-dark. The key ideas are:

- Incorporating the quantified visibility constraint implied by the human vision system into the illumination spectrum optimization process. This allows designing spectra that are invisible or barely visible to human eyes while still providing enough information for RGB image reconstruction. 

- Modeling the image formation process in the VIS-NIR range and automatically optimizing the LED spectral multiplexing in a fully differentiable manner, under the visibility constraint. This results in an optimal wide-band spectrum covering 420nm-890nm.

- Collecting a new VIS-NIR hyperspectral image dataset with 50 bands for experiments.

- Showing significantly improved seeing-in-the-dark results using the optimized wide-band illumination compared to using NIR illumination only.

- Analyzing the impact of different visibility thresholds on the optimized spectra and restoration performance. This demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed model.

In summary, the key novelty is incorporating the quantified human vision constraint into the wide-band illumination optimization for seeing-in-the-dark tasks. This allows jointly optimizing the spectrum design and image restoration within a unified differentiable framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Visibility Constrained Spectrum Design (VCSD) that improves seeing-in-the-dark by optimizing illumination across the visible and near-infrared range while constraining the illumination to be invisible to the human eye, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a new collected dataset of hyperspectral images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on seeing-in-the-dark and low-light image enhancement:

- Most prior work focuses on either RGB-dependent methods that try to restore information from degraded RGB images, or RGB-independent methods that translate NIR images to RGB. This paper proposes a novel approach of optimizing the illumination spectrum itself to improve performance. 

- The key novelty is incorporating a quantified visibility constraint based on the human vision system into the spectrum optimization process. This allows expanding the illumination into the visible range while still keeping it friendly to human eyes. 

- The proposed method designs the spectrum in a fully automatic end-to-end manner, unlike some prior work that relies on manually predefined NIR illumination. The visibility constraint can also be flexibly adjusted based on application needs.

- The paper introduces a new large-scale hyperspectral dataset to facilitate this research direction, which supplements existing datasets.

- Experiments demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-art methods relying solely on NIR illumination. The analysis also validates the benefits of joint visibility-constrained optimization over using predefined illumination.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions to seeing-in-the-dark by proposing a novel illumination optimization paradigm with an integrated human vision model. The flexibility in tuning the visibility level is also appealing for practical applications. The new dataset and promising results advance the state-of-the-art in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring more flexible illumination design using wide band fluorescent dyes or custom thin-film interference filters, rather than just narrow band LEDs. The authors note that narrow band LEDs may not be optimal for recovering high-fidelity visible color due to the scale-down operation required by the visibility constraint. More flexible illumination could help address this.

- Evaluating the proposed method on real captured data rather than just synthetic/simulated data. The current results are promising but evaluating on real data could reveal additional challenges. 

- Extending the approach to video seeing in the dark. The current method focuses on still images. Adapting it to video could broaden the applicability.

- Incorporating a more sophisticated noise model. The authors use a basic Poisson plus real noise model currently. Exploring more advanced noise modeling could further improve results.

- Considering a joint optimization of the illumination spectrum and image processing model, rather than just optimizing the spectrum separately. This could lead to further performance gains.

- Exploring the use of different visibility thresholds and how they impact performance on real data. The threshold impacts the results significantly in simulations. Validating optimal values for real data could be beneficial.

In summary, the key suggestions are around exploring more flexible illumination designs, evaluating on real data, extending to video and noise modeling, joint optimization, and further analysis of visibility thresholds. Overall the paper presents a solid approach and framework ripe for future enhancement and extension.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a visibility-constrained wide-band illumination spectrum design (VCSD) model for seeing-in-the-dark tasks. The key idea is to quantify and incorporate the human vision system into the illumination spectrum optimization process. Specifically, they establish a visibility model that constrains the designed illumination spectrum to be invisible or barely visible to human eyes. This allows them to exploit information in both the visible and near-infrared ranges to reconstruct the RGB image, while keeping the illumination friendly to human vision. They also propose a differentiable image formation model to simulate the imaging process under the designed illumination. By optimizing the LED intensities to minimize an image reconstruction loss, they obtain an optimal wide-band spectrum covering 420nm to 890nm. Experiments on a collected hyperspectral dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to using only near-infrared illumination.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for seeing in the dark by designing an optimal illumination spectrum in the wide visible and near-infrared spectral range. The key idea is to incorporate the visibility constraints of the human vision system into the illumination spectrum optimization process. The authors propose a Visibility Constrained Spectrum Design (VCSD) model to quantify the visibility of certain spectra to human eyes and make sure the designed spectrum does not exceed a prescribed visibility level. They also design a physics-based Imaging Process Simulation (IPS) model to synthesize the input images using the optimized illumination spectrum, camera spectral sensitivity and scene reflectance. The model also simulates noise to approximate real imaging conditions. 

The authors contribute a substantially expanded dataset of 74 visible-near infrared hyperspectral images captured using a 50-band filter wheel system. Experiments on this dataset and another existing dataset show that optimizing the wide-band illumination spectrum significantly outperforms using only near-infrared illumination. Analysis of results using different visibility threshold values proves the flexibility of their method to trade-off visibility friendliness and restoration performance. The designed illumination spectrum can also be approximately realized using combinations of narrowband LEDs. Overall, this paper presents a novel paradigm to incorporate human vision constraints for robust seeing in the dark via wide-band optimized illumination.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a visibility-constrained wide-band illumination spectrum design (VCSD) model for seeing-in-the-dark. The key idea is to quantify the visibility constraint implied by the human vision system and incorporate it into the illumination spectrum design process. Specifically, they introduce a visibility threshold Ψ^ that represents the maximum allowed visibility to the human eye. Based on this threshold, they scale down the initial LED spectrum to assure it is invisible to human eyes. They also design a physics-based imaging process simulation (IPS) model to synthesize images using the optimized illumination spectrum, camera spectral sensitivity, and scene reflectance. The model is trained end-to-end to optimize the LED spectrum weights under the visibility constraint. Experiments on a collected VIS-NIR hyperspectral dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to using NIR illumination only. The flexibility of the model in dealing with different visibility thresholds is also analyzed.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of seeing in the dark, which aims to recover visible color images in extremely low light conditions. Specifically, it focuses on RGB-independent methods that utilize auxiliary near-infrared (NIR) illumination to capture images and translate them to the RGB domain. 

The key limitations of existing NIR-to-RGB translation methods that the paper identifies are:

1) Using monochromatic NIR illumination around 850nm or 940nm makes image translation ambiguous due to the overlap in RGB camera sensitivities and indistinguishable material reflectances. 

2) Existing works empirically pick wavelengths beyond 700nm for "invisible" NIR illumination, but do not explicitly quantify or constrain the visibility during optimization.

To address these issues, the key questions/goals of this paper are:

1) How to formally quantify the visibility of illumination spectra to the human vision system? 

2) How to optimize the illumination spectrum in a wide band from 420nm to 890nm under explicit visibility constraints?

3) How to design an imaging pipeline to simulate real capture and improve translation with the optimized illumination?

In summary, the paper aims to address the ambiguity and lack of robustness in NIR-to-RGB translation by optimizing the illumination spectrum under visibility constraints modeled on the human vision system.
