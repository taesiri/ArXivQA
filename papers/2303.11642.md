# [Visibility Constrained Wide-band Illumination Spectrum Design for   Seeing-in-the-Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11642)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an optimal illumination spectrum for seeing-in-the-dark that is friendly to human vision while also enabling high quality image restoration. 

The key insights are:

1) Quantifying the visibility constraint of different illumination spectra based on the human vision system (scotopic vision sensitivity). 

2) Incorporating this visibility constraint into the optimization of the illumination spectrum to find the best trade-off between friendliness to human vision and effectiveness for image restoration.

3) Modeling the full imaging pipeline from illumination spectrum to camera spectral sensitivity to material reflectance to formulate the optimization in an end-to-end differentiable manner.

The main hypothesis is that optimizing the illumination spectrum in the visible-near infrared range under explicit visibility constraints will enable significantly better seeing-in-the-dark image restoration compared to using only near-infrared illumination. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in formally modeling the human vision sensitivity, incorporating it into illumination optimization for seeing in the dark, and demonstrating substantially improved results over prior arts. The proposed Visibility Constrained Spectrum Design provides a principled framework to address the core trade-off between visibility and restoration quality.
