# [Efficient Decision-based Black-box Patch Attacks on Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11917)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How to achieve efficient decision-based patch attacks against video recognition models?

The authors note that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, where perceptible perturbations are added to inputs to cause misclassification. Previous work has focused on patch attacks for image models, but less work has explored video models. The authors propose to study decision-based patch attacks on video models, where the attack only has access to predicted labels rather than model scores. 

The key challenges are:

1) The large parameter space for video (temporal dimension) increases attack difficulty and query burden compared to images. 

2) The minimal feedback (only predicted labels) in decision-based setting makes optimization more difficult compared to score-based attacks.

To address these challenges, the authors propose a Spatial-Temporal Differential Evolution (STDE) method to achieve query-efficient decision-based patch attacks on video models. The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully modeling the patch parameters and adopting spatial-temporal evolutionary optimization, they can achieve potent attacks with high query efficiency.

In summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective decision-based patch attacks on video efficiently, which requires addressing the challenges of the large video parameter space and minimal feedback. The authors hypothesize STDE can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a new black-box patch attack method against video recognition models called Spatial-Temporal Differential Evolution (STDE). The main contributions are:

- It proposes a new attack setting called "decision-based patch attack" on video models, where the attacker can only access the top-1 predicted label rather than continuous scores. This is a more challenging but practical attack scenario.

- It develops a novel attack algorithm STDE tailored for this new setting. STDE reduces the search space by using target videos as patch textures and only adding patches on keyframes. It formulates the attack as a combinatorial optimization problem and uses spatial-temporal differential evolution to solve it efficiently. 

- Extensive experiments show STDE achieves 100% success rates with smaller patch sizes and fewer queries compared to prior arts. It demonstrates superior attack performance, efficiency, and imperceptibility.

- This is the first work that explores patch-based targeted attacks on video models. Analysis shows STDE fools models by altering their attention distributions.

- This work bridges the gap in evaluating the robustness of video recognition models. STDE provides a powerful tool to help build more secure video models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the new decision-based patch attack setting for video models, and developing a novel attack algorithm STDE that achieves state-of-the-art performance in this setting. This improves the assessment of video model robustness.
