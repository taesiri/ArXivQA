# [Efficient Decision-based Black-box Patch Attacks on Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11917)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to achieve efficient decision-based patch attacks against video recognition models?The authors note that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, where perceptible perturbations are added to inputs to cause misclassification. Previous work has focused on patch attacks for image models, but less work has explored video models. The authors propose to study decision-based patch attacks on video models, where the attack only has access to predicted labels rather than model scores. The key challenges are:1) The large parameter space for video (temporal dimension) increases attack difficulty and query burden compared to images. 2) The minimal feedback (only predicted labels) in decision-based setting makes optimization more difficult compared to score-based attacks.To address these challenges, the authors propose a Spatial-Temporal Differential Evolution (STDE) method to achieve query-efficient decision-based patch attacks on video models. The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully modeling the patch parameters and adopting spatial-temporal evolutionary optimization, they can achieve potent attacks with high query efficiency.In summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective decision-based patch attacks on video efficiently, which requires addressing the challenges of the large video parameter space and minimal feedback. The authors hypothesize STDE can achieve this goal.
