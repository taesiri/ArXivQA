# [Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the important problem of training fair machine learning models in a federated learning (FL) setting. FL allows collaborative model training from decentralized data located on user devices, without compromising data privacy. However, the decentralized data can be heterogeneous across users, making it challenging to ensure fairness towards different user groups (group fairness) and fairness across individual users (client fairness). Achieving multi-dimensional fairness in FL remains an open problem.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new method called "Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning (mFairFL)" to achieve both group fairness and client fairness in the FL setting. mFairFL formulates the problem as a constrained optimization problem with a minimax objective function involving accuracy and fairness terms. Before aggregating locally trained models, mFairFL detects conflicts among client gradients and iteratively adjusts conflicting gradients to align them towards the overall fairness goal. 

Specifically, mFairFL introduces Lagrange multipliers to relax the fairness constraints into the optimization objective. In each communication round, clients compute statistics related to loss, fairness metric, and gradients to send to the server. The server checks for gradient conflicts among clients using cosine similarity. For conflicting gradients, mFairFL carefully curates the gradient's direction and magnitude before aggregation to mitigate negative impacts. The gradients are aggregated in an order based on client losses to prevent harming disadvantaged clients.


Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a novel framework mFairFL for multi-dimensional fairness in federated learning, involving both group and client fairness

2) Conceptualizes fairness optimization through a meticulously designed minimax framework with group fairness constraints  

3) Analyzes and adjusts potentially conflicting gradients throughout training to ensure equitable outcomes for sensitive groups and individual clients

4) Demonstrates through theoretical analysis that mFairFL effectively diminishes gradient conflicts and achieves superior group fairness

5) Empirical evaluation on 3 datasets shows mFairFL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ensuring multi-dimensional fairness while preserving accuracy.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in achieving group and client fairness in the decentralized federated learning paradigm, through a principled approach of formulating the problem and handling gradient conflicts during optimization. The proposed mFairFL method shows great promise.
