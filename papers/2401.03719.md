## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) models do not effectively capture spatial and temporal features from spatio-temporal patterns. They ignore differences in the impact of historical context across spatial and temporal dimensions.

- Lack of mechanisms for efficient memory invocation and redundancy elimination in existing RSNN models.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a recurrent spiking neural network with spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) called SRNN-SCBAM.

- Introduce spiking convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) structure into SNNs to capture spatio-temporal features.

- Employ spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) to invoke relevant history information adaptively in spatial and temporal channels. 

Main Contributions:

- First RSNN model combining spiking ConvLSTM structure and spiking CBAM attention mechanism for capturing spatial and temporal features.

- SCBAM enables efficient memory invocation and redundancy elimination by focusing on key spatial and temporal features. 

- Evaluated on CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128 Gesture datasets. Achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other RSNN models.

- Ablation studies demonstrate effectiveness of SCBAM component in improving model accuracy over baseline Spiking ConvLSTM.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel recurrent spiking neural network architecture using spiking ConvLSTM and attention to effectively process spatio-temporal event streams while adaptively utilizing relevant historical context.
