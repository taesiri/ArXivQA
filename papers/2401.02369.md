# [SPEER: Sentence-Level Planning of Long Clinical Summaries via Embedded   Entity Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Clinicians face high documentation burden when writing discharge summaries, needing to synthesize lengthy patient records into a coherent narrative summary. This is cognitively demanding and time consuming.
- Two main challenges: identifying salient information from lengthy records and ensuring coverage of key details without omission.

Proposed Solution:
- Fine-tune large language models (LLMs) Mistral and Zephyr on a large dataset of hospital visit records and discharge summaries. 
- Show LLMs generate fluent but often incomplete and unfaithful summaries.
- Propose SPEER: use a separate model to explicitly select salient entities, embed these onto source notes, and instruct LLM to retrieve embedded entities when generating each sentence.

Key Contributions:
- Fine-tune open-source 7B parameter LLMs on a new large-scale clinical summarization dataset.
- Demonstrate explicit content selection by a dedicated model outperforms LLM's implicit content selection.
- Introduce SPEER - guides LLM summarization by sentence-level planning based on retrieving embedded salient entities.
- Show SPEER improves both coverage and faithfulness over non-guided and prompted guided baselines across multiple test sets.

In summary, this paper tackles the challenging problem of clinical note summarization by using explicit entity-based content selection to guide large language model generation, enabling more complete and accurate summarization while reducing omissions. The proposed SPEER approach of embedding planning based on salient entities directly in the source text is shown to be an effective guide for high quality summarization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper fine-tunes large language models on clinical hospital course summarization, finding that explicit content selection with a dedicated classifier outperforms implicit content selection during decoding, and proposes SPEER, a method that embeds salient entities and performs sentence-level planning via retrieval to improve coverage and faithfulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Fine-tuning large language models (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-β) on a large-scale dataset for long-form clinical summarization of hospital courses, and testing them on three diverse datasets from different electronic health records.

2) Demonstrating that explicit content selection, performed by a dedicated small classifier model, outperforms the implicit content selection that occurs during auto-regressive decoding by the large language models. 

3) Introducing SPEER (Sentence-Level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval), an easy-to-implement method that improves coverage of salient entities and faithfulness over both non-guided and guided LLM baselines by embedding salient entities back onto the source notes and having the LLM explicitly retrieve them when generating each sentence.

So in summary, the main contributions relate to adapting large language models to clinical summarization, showing the value of explicit content selection, and proposing the SPEER method to improve entity coverage and faithfulness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Hospital-course summarization - The task of synthesizing the events and rationale that occurred over a patient's hospital stay into a narrative summary.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Refers specifically to Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-β models that are fine-tuned on the hospital course summarization task.  

- Content selection - Selecting the most salient medical concepts (represented as Entity Synonym Groups or ESGs) to include in the summary. This is treated as a separate classification task.

- Entity-guided summarization - Generating summaries conditioned on a specific set of pre-selected salient ESGs to guide the LLM.

- SPEER - The proposed method which stands for Sentence-Level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. It involves marking salient ESG spans in the source notes and having the LLM explicitly retrieve them when generating each sentence.

- Coverage - Measured by Source-Grounded Recall (SGR) which calculates the overlap between source-aligned entities in the reference and generated summaries.  

- Faithfulness - Measured by Hallucination Rate (HR) and other metrics like BERTScore Precision (BSP) and ClinDistill. These evaluate whether entities or sentences in the summary are supported by the source notes.

Does this summary cover the key terms and concepts from the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. SPEER involves marking salient entity spans in the source notes with special boundary tags ({{ }}). What is the motivation behind embedding the salient entities back onto the source notes in this way? How does it help with grounding and state tracking compared to just providing a prompt list of salient entities?

2. The paper demonstrates that explicit content selection with a dedicated model works better than implicit content selection via autoregressive decoding of the summary text. Why might this be the case? What limitations exist in relying solely on the language model's own implicit content selection? 

3. Explain the high-level differences between prompt-based entity guidance ("Guided") and SPEER. What potential issues could arise from relying only on prompt guidance and how does SPEER address them?

4. Why is sentence-level planning an important component of the SPEER approach? How does forcing the model to explicitly retrieve entities before each sentence aid in state tracking and coverage of salient concepts? 

5. The SPEER approach seems straightforward to implement by simply adding entity tags. What challenges exist in extending this approach to other summarization tasks and datasets? Would any changes need to be made?

6. Could the SPEER approach work without explicit content selection and instead just rely on marking all entities in the source notes? What potential advantages and limitations would this have?

7. The authors use greedy decoding in this work. How might beam search decoding interact with the SPEER approach? What changes would need to be made to properly leverage beam search?

8. What other methods exist for guiding large language models that could be compared to SPEER? What are some key advantages and limitations of these other approaches? 

9. Error analysis reveals certain types of sentences commonly produced by models that hurt faithfulness (e.g. unsupported patient understanding statements). Does SPEER fully address generating these extraneous statements? If not, how could it be improved?

10. The authors use a regression model (ClinDistill) to evaluate sentence-level faithfulness. What other automatic metrics could be used or developed to better evaluate key attributes like faithfulness and coverage for this summarization task?
