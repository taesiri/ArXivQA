# [RAPHAEL: Text-to-Image Generation via Large Mixture of Diffusion Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18295)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research questions and hypotheses of this paper are:1. How can we develop a text-to-image generator that produces highly artistic images that accurately reflect the given text prompts? The key hypothesis is that by using a large mixture of diffusion paths through stacked mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers, the model can enable different "painting" routes from input to output that allow aligning different text concepts with image regions.2. Can stacking space-MoE and time-MoE layers lead to superior image generation performance compared to previous cross-attention mechanisms?The hypothesis is that having separate experts handle text concepts and diffusion timesteps will improve text-image alignment and image quality over standard cross-attention. 3. Does incorporating edge-supervised learning into the model training further enhance the aesthetic quality of generated images?The hypothesis is that by having the model predict and match image edges during training, it will learn to generate images with improved artistic detail and appeal.4. Can a single RAPHAEL model surpass the state-of-the-art in metrics like FID and human evaluation? The hypothesis is that by combining mixture of experts, edge learning, and a large model scale, RAPHAEL can set new state-of-the-art benchmarks compared to previous text-to-image generators.In summary, the main research questions focus on developing a text-to-image generator that produces artistic, high-fidelity images through advanced techniques like mixture of experts and edge learning. The key hypotheses are that these methods will improve text-image alignment and aesthetic quality compared to prior work.
