# [Intensive Vision-guided Network for Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automatic radiology report generation using AI models is an important task with huge application potential. However, existing approaches have limitations in both image feature extraction and text generation:

1) For image feature extraction, most models focus on single-view structure modeling (e.g. space or channel view) while ignoring multi-view reasoning, which is important for radiology images. 

2) For text generation, most models overlook context reasoning with multi-modal information and rely on pure textual optimization or retrieval methods. They cannot highlight abnormal observations or generate logical associations between clinical findings and diseases.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an Intensive Vision-guided Network (IVGN) to address the above limitations. It contains:

1) A Globally-intensive Attention (GIA) guided visual encoder to enhance multi-view feature extraction. GIA integrates depth, space and pixel view perception to extract salient visual features.

2) A Visual Knowledge-guided Decoder (VKGD) for text generation. VKGD can adaptively consider the reliance on visual information and previously predicted words to assist next word prediction. This allows generating accurate and logical reports.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose IVGN containing GIA and VKGD to address limitations in both image feature extraction and text generation for radiology report task.

2) GIA stimulates multi-view visual reasoning to extract salient image features from depth, space and pixel views.  

3) VKGD can adaptively rely on visual information and previous words to predict next word, generating accurate reports.

4) Achieve superior performance over previous state-of-the-art models on two benchmark chest x-ray datasets, especially in clinical efficacy metrics. The model is also lightweight.

In summary, the paper explores stimulating radiologists' multi-view perspective and automatically generating accurate radiology reports to promote medical automation. The proposed IVGN model achieves new state-of-the-art on this task.
