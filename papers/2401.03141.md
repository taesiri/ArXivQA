# [Estimating the Lateral Motion States of an Underwater Robot by Propeller   Wake Sensing Using an Artificial Lateral Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper investigates the challenging problem of estimating the relative lateral motion states (displacement, velocity magnitude and direction) of a leader propeller-driven underwater robot by an follower robot with an artificial lateral line (ALL) sensory system in a leader-follower formation. Compared to wake flows generated by bioinspired robotic fish, the propeller wake flow is highly dynamic and complex, presenting significant difficulties for ALL-based sensing. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper hypothesizes that although not fully representing the propeller wake dynamics, the spatiotemporal pressure measurements by the ALL provide sufficient information for estimating the lateral motion states. A testbed with a leader propeller, an ALL sensor, motion control and data acquisition systems is constructed. A hybrid deep neural network consisting of 1D CNN and BiLSTM is designed to extract spatial and temporal features from the ALL measurements. A multi-output network combines regression and classification to estimate the continuous and discrete motion states. The loss function is a weighted combination of individual losses for the three states, with the weights optimized using whale optimization algorithm.

Main Contributions:
1) First work investigating feasibility and algorithm design of ALL-based sensing of highly dynamic propeller wake for motion state estimation in leader-follower underwater robots.
2) Designed testbed and conducted extensive experiments to provide insights.  
3) Proposed a data-driven sensory flow feature extraction and multi-state estimation algorithm based on deep learning. Achieved high estimation accuracy.
4) Studied the effects of time series length and optimized task weights on overall performance. Demonstrated superior performance over baseline methods.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, proposed solution methodology, experiments, results and contributions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first efforts to investigate the feasibility and the algorithmic design of flow sensing with highly dynamic and complex propeller wake using an artificial lateral line (ALL) in a leader-follower formation of underwater robots. A testbed is designed and extensive experiments are conducted to provide insights into this challenging problem. 

2. This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm for estimating the lateral motion states (including displacement, velocity magnitude, and direction) of the propeller-driven leader robot using the ALL. The algorithm integrates 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) to extract spatiotemporal flow features, as well as a multi-output deep neural network for the lateral motion state estimation. In addition, the task weights of the loss function are optimized using the whale optimization algorithm to improve the accuracy of the estimation results.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in investigating and developing algorithms for ALL-based sensing and estimation of complex propeller wake flows for underwater robotics applications.
