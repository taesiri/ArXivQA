# [Adaptive Intra-Class Variation Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised   Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Adaptive Intra-Class Variation Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification":

Problem:
- Existing unsupervised person re-id methods using memory dictionary-based contrastive learning either update the memory using all samples, failing to utilize the most challenging samples, or only use the hardest samples, risking introducing false positives early on. 
- Discarding outliers loses valuable information.
- Fails to account for intra-class variations in model's learning capability across clusters.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Adaptive Intra-Class Variation Contrastive Learning (AdaInCV) algorithm that evaluates the model's learning capability for each cluster separately by measuring intra-class variation. This allows selection of suitable samples during training.

- Propose two strategies:
   - Adaptive Sample Mining (AdaSaM): Gradually selects more reliable samples to update memory based on model's capability on each cluster.
   - Adaptive Outlier Filtering (AdaOF): Identifies and filters valuable outliers as negative samples based on model's capability across dataset.

Main Contributions:
- AdaInCV algorithm that can assess model's learning capability for each cluster individually using intra-class variations.
- AdaSaM strategy enables selection of appropriate difficulty samples to update memory based on model's capability on each cluster.
- AdaOF utilizes model's capability across dataset to select useful outliers as negative samples.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Market-1501 and MSMT17 datasets, outperforming previous unsupervised & UDA methods.
- Converges faster, offering advantages for practical applications.
- Essentially improves contrastive learning for fine-grained datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel adaptive curriculum contrastive learning approach for unsupervised person re-id that evaluates model's capability on each cluster separately to select suitable samples and outliers for optimized contrastive learning.
