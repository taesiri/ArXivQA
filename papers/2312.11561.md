# [COPD-FlowNet: Elevating Non-invasive COPD Diagnosis with CFD Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) causes breathing difficulties due to airway obstruction. Detecting the location of obstruction sites is important for treatment planning. 
- Conventional diagnostic methods like bronchoscopy are invasive and expensive. 
- Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations for diagnosis is promising but generating a large labeled dataset is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose COPD-FlowNet - a framework that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic CFD velocity flow images of COPD patients' trachea. This augments the dataset for training.
- Also propose a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to predict obstruction location (left lung, right lung or both lungs).

Methodology: 
- GAN generator uses CNN layers to output 128x128 pixel flow images. Discriminator uses convolutional and dense layers.
- CNN classifier takes 128x128 images as input. Uses convolution blocks with varying kernel sizes and ReLU activation for feature extraction.

Experiments:
- Dataset has 295 CFD images labeled with obstruction location. Augmented to 1200 images using GAN.
- Proposed CNN classifier achieves 96.35% accuracy outperforming ResNet-50 and EfficientNet.

Conclusion:
- Proposed approach integrates deep learning and CFD for COPD diagnosis. GANs can effectively augment CFD datasets. Custom CNN architecture outperforms common models.

Main Contributions:
- Novel GAN framework (COPD-FlowNet) to generate synthetic CFD images to augment dataset
- Custom CNN architecture for detecting obstruction location
- Integrates deep learning and CFD simulations for non-invasive COPD diagnosis
