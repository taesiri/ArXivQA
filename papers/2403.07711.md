# [SSM Meets Video Diffusion Models: Efficient Video Generation with   Structured State Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent video generation models using diffusion models have shown impressive results. However, these models typically use attention layers to capture temporal dependencies, which have quadratic memory complexity with respect to sequence length. This limits the application of these models to longer video sequences. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes to incorporate state space models (SSMs) which have linear complexity into the temporal layers of video diffusion models. Specifically, the authors propose a temporal SSM layer consisting of:

- Bidirectional SSM module based on S4D to capture temporal dynamics 
- Addition of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) after the SSM module to integrate information across channels

This temporal SSM layer replaces the temporal attention layers in existing video diffusion models like VDMs.

Experiments:
The proposed model is evaluated on UCF101 and long MineRL videos with 64 and 150 frames. It shows competitive or better Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) compared to attention-based models on UCF101, and the ability to generate much longer 150 frame MineRL videos which attention models fail to do due to memory constraints.

Ablations:
Ablations validate the importance of bidirectionality and the MLP in the temporal SSM layer through FVD comparisons. Comparisons to prior SSM architectures like GSS, BiGS and Mamba also show the superiority of the proposed simplified temporal SSM layer.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of a simple yet effective temporal SSM layer to incorporate SSMs into video diffusion models 
- Demonstration of competitive video generation quality compared to attention models 
- Ability to generate longer video sequences not feasible with attention models
- Analysis of design choices through extensive ablations

The main impact is the potential to develop video generation models that can handle longer sequences without the quadratic memory cost of attentions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes incorporating state-space models into the temporal layers of video diffusion models to efficiently generate longer video sequences while maintaining competitive quality compared to attention-based models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective approach to incorporate state-space models (SSMs) into video diffusion models in order to generate longer video sequences while maintaining competitive generative performance. Specifically, the paper:

- Proposes a temporal SSM layer architecture consisting of a bidirectional SSM module followed by a multi-layer perceptron, to replace the temporal attention layers in video diffusion models.

- Demonstrates through experiments on UCF101 and MineRL datasets that the proposed temporal SSM layer can generate videos competitively with temporal attention layers while being more memory-efficient for longer video sequences. 

- Shows that attention-based models struggle to generate longer (150-frame) videos due to memory constraints, while the SSM-based model can successfully generate such longer videos.

- Conducts an ablation study to identify important components like bidirectionality and MLP layers in the temporal SSM architecture.

- Compares with prior SSM architectures and shows the proposed simple temporal SSM layer works the best for video generation diffusion models.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling video diffusion models to generate longer video sequences through an efficiently designed temporal SSM layer, overcoming the memory limitations of attention-based models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes incorporating state space models (SSMs) into the temporal layers of video diffusion models. Why are SSMs well-suited for this task compared to other sequence modeling techniques like RNNs or attention? What are the specific advantages of SSMs?

2) The paper uses a bidirectional structure for the SSM instead of a unidirectional one. What is the rationale behind this choice? How does bidirectionality help the SSM better capture temporal dynamics in videos? 

3) The proposed architecture places a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) after the bidirectional SSM module. Why is this MLP component necessary? What purpose does it serve in integrating information across different dimensions?

4) The paper compares the proposed temporal SSM layer architecture with prior SSM architectures like GSS and Mamba. Why does the simpler proposed architecture outperform these more complex ones designed for other tasks?

5) Could incorporating the proposed temporal SSM layers into other video diffusion model architectures like Make-A-Video or Imagen Video confer similar memory savings benefits? What modifications might be needed?

6) The paper focuses on unconditional video generation. How could the proposed approach be extended to conditional tasks like text-to-video generation? Would employing methods like classifier guidance help?

7) What hyperparameters of the SSM (like number of layers, hidden dimensions etc.) were optimized in the paper? How sensitive is performance to getting these right? 

8) The paper uses a simple epsilon-prediction objective. How might more complex objectives like v-prediction or DDIM sampling affect the integration of SSMs into diffusion models?

9) For how long could videos be generated using the SSM approach before performance deteriorates or memory issues resurface? Were limits tested?

10) Could incorporating ideas from recent work on improving SSMs like the Equivariant SSM further boost performance for video modeling? What adjustments would be needed?
