# [Benchmarking Large Language Models on Controllable Generation under   Diversified Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes CoDI-Eval, a new benchmark for systematically evaluating the capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate text under different constraints specified in natural language instructions. 

Problem: 
While LLMs have shown impressive instruction-following abilities, it remains unclear whether they can properly adhere to varying constraints entailed in diverse instructions. Existing controllable text generation (CTG) evaluations are limited as they rely on fixed variables instead of free-form instructions. Recently proposed instruction-based CTG benchmarks still lack diversity in their instructions.

Solution:
CoDI-Eval features a large collection of diversified natural language instructions covering various common CTG constraints. Through a two-step bootstrap process, seed instructions are expanded and rewritten to maximize diversity. Five representative CTG tasks are included: sentiment, topic, length, keyword and toxicity avoidance control, along with a multi-aspect task. Easy-to-use automated evaluations are provided to facilitate benchmarking. 

Main Contributions:
1) A new benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs' controllable generation capability under diversified natural language instructions.
2) Automated and reliable evaluation methods for benchmarking and further research.  
3) Extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs to validate and compare their CTG performance, revealing existing capability gaps.

The proposed benchmark and evaluations enable properly measuring LLMs' alignment with constraints in free-form instructions. Experiments using CoDI-Eval can diagnose LLMs' limitations in controllable generation tasks and motivate further progress.
