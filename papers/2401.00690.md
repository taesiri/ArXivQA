# [Benchmarking Large Language Models on Controllable Generation under   Diversified Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes CoDI-Eval, a new benchmark for systematically evaluating the capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate text under different constraints specified in natural language instructions. 

Problem: 
While LLMs have shown impressive instruction-following abilities, it remains unclear whether they can properly adhere to varying constraints entailed in diverse instructions. Existing controllable text generation (CTG) evaluations are limited as they rely on fixed variables instead of free-form instructions. Recently proposed instruction-based CTG benchmarks still lack diversity in their instructions.

Solution:
CoDI-Eval features a large collection of diversified natural language instructions covering various common CTG constraints. Through a two-step bootstrap process, seed instructions are expanded and rewritten to maximize diversity. Five representative CTG tasks are included: sentiment, topic, length, keyword and toxicity avoidance control, along with a multi-aspect task. Easy-to-use automated evaluations are provided to facilitate benchmarking. 

Main Contributions:
1) A new benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs' controllable generation capability under diversified natural language instructions.
2) Automated and reliable evaluation methods for benchmarking and further research.  
3) Extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs to validate and compare their CTG performance, revealing existing capability gaps.

The proposed benchmark and evaluations enable properly measuring LLMs' alignment with constraints in free-form instructions. Experiments using CoDI-Eval can diagnose LLMs' limitations in controllable generation tasks and motivate further progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called CoDI-Eval for systematically evaluating large language models' capability to generate text under various constraints specified in diverse natural language instructions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing CoDI-Eval, a new benchmark for systematically and comprehensively evaluating the controllable text generation capabilities of large language models under diversified natural language instructions. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) CoDI-Eval features high coverage of typical controllable text generation tasks and control attributes. It includes tasks like sentiment, topic, length, keyword, and toxicity avoidance control.

2) CoDI-Eval maximizes the diversity of instructions using a two-step process - expansion and diversification. This improves generalization and makes the instructions closer to real-world scenarios. 

3) The paper provides automated, easy-to-use, and reliable evaluation methods for each controllable generation task in CoDI-Eval to facilitate further research.

4) The paper conducts extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs using CoDI-Eval, revealing their limitations in following instructions with constraints and quantifying the gap between open-source and commercial LLMs.

In summary, CoDI-Eval is a new benchmark that can systematically evaluate and compare LLMs' capabilities for controllable text generation, an important aspect of model alignment. It features high coverage, instruction diversity, easy evaluation, and extensive experiments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step process of instruction expansion and diversification for constructing the evaluation instruction set. What are the motivations and advantages of having this two-step approach compared to only using instruction expansion?

2. The instruction diversification step employs both basic and more complex rewrite methods obtained from querying GPT-4. Why is it important to have both basic and more advanced rewrite methods? How do they complement each other? 

3. The paper argues that the instruction diversity in CoDI-Eval is closer to real-world usage scenarios compared to previous benchmarks. What specific analysis or experiments were done to validate this claim?

4. For the task taxonomy selection in CoDI-Eval, what principles or criteria guided the choice of constraints and sub-tasks to include? Why are those particular constraints and sub-tasks important to evaluate?

5. What measures were taken during the automated instruction construction process to ensure the quality and correctness of the generated instructions? How was instruction filtering utilized?

6. The human evaluation results show high consistency with the automated evaluations. What factors contribute to this high agreement? How might the human evaluation consistency change if more complex downstream tasks were integrated?

7. For the few-shot experiments, why does simple in-context learning not necessarily improve controllable generation performance? What approaches could be explored to make few-shot learning more effective? 

8. The paper identifies accurately attributing failure cases as a challenging problem in CoDI-Eval. What analyses could be done to gain more insight into whether failures are from misunderstanding instructions or failing to execute constraints?

9. How was the choice of language models, decoding methods, and experiment settings optimized to ensure a fair comparison between models? What sensitivity studies were done?

10. What future work directions does the paper propose to enhance instruction-based controllable text generation? What tasks or model capabilities need to be improved? How might the benchmark evolve?
