# [AuditLLM: A Tool for Auditing Large Language Models Using Multiprobe   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical real-world applications, it becomes important to ensure they are safe, reliable and consistent. However, there is a lack of easy-to-use tools for auditing LLMs to probe them for potential inconsistencies which could indicate issues like bias or hallucinations. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces "AuditLLM", a novel tool for evaluating LLMs using a "multiprobe" approach. It generates multiple variations of a query to test if the LLM provides consistent responses. AuditLLM has two modes:

1) Live mode: Allows real-time auditing of an LLM by users entering a query and getting back probe questions generated by another LLM, along with the consistency-analyzed responses. 

2) Batch mode: Enables running multiple test queries together for more comprehensive auditing. Produces a report analyzing consistency across responses for the queries.

Key Contributions:
- Presents an easy-to-use tool for auditing LLMs using multiprobe questions to test consistency
- Live mode allows real-time probing of LLMs to quickly check for issues
- Batch mode facilitates large-scale auditing by testing multiple queries together  
- Provides quantitative consistency scores and visualizations to interpret audition results
- Can compare multiple LLMs to evaluate which is more robust and reliable

The tool enables both researchers and general users to better understand inconsistencies in LLM-generated responses on a common platform. It is designed to address the lack of consistency-focused LLM auditing tools.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces AuditLLM, a novel tool with live and batch modes to systematically audit large language models by generating multiple probes from a single user query and analyzing the semantic similarity of model responses to uncover potential inconsistencies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution seems to be the introduction of a novel auditing tool called "AuditLLM". Specifically:

The key highlights of AuditLLM as the main contribution are:

- It is designed to evaluate the performance of various large language models (LLMs) in a methodical way by auditing them using multiple probes generated from a single question. This allows it to identify any inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation.

- It has two key modes: (1) Live mode for real-time auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to queries entered by the user. (2) Batch mode to facilitate more comprehensive auditing by processing multiple queries together for in-depth analysis. 

- It produces interpretable results regarding the consistency of the LLM's responses to different versions of the same question. Inconsistencies can indicate potential issues like bias or hallucinations.

- It provides a general-purpose, standardized platform for auditing LLMs, catering to both researchers and general users. 

In summary, the main contribution is the development of the AuditLLM tool itself to probe LLMs using multiple iterations of queries and assess the consistency of their responses as a way to audit their capabilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with it are:

"Large Language Model", "Auditing LLMs Tools"

These keywords are listed in the CCSXML section and also under the abstract of the paper. Specifically, the paper states:

\ccsdesc[500]{Large Language Model~ Auditing LLMs Tools}  

\keywords{Large Language Model, Auditing LLMs Tools}

So the key terms that summarize the focus of this paper are "Large Language Model" and "Auditing LLMs Tools". These terms indicate that the paper is about auditing tools and techniques for large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What is the theoretical basis for using multiple probes generated from a single question to audit language models? Does generating semantically similar responses indicate robustness and reliability?

2. How was the prompt template for generating probes in LLM1 created? What criteria were used to validate the prompts? 

3. What techniques are used to quantitatively determine the semantic similarity between language model responses? What similarity thresholds indicate inconsistency? 

4. What are the key differences in methodology between the live mode and batch mode for auditing language models? What are the relative advantages of each?

5. How was the set of language models included in AuditLLM selected? What criteria determined their inclusion and how can additional models be added?

6. How can the slope of the regression line in Figure 2 be interpreted? What values indicate higher or lower consistency in language model responses?

7. What modifications could be made to the question generation approach to improve relevance and diversity of probes? Are there alternative techniques?

8. How do the probes and analysis focus specifically on uncovering inconsistencies? Could the methodology be adapted to uncover other issues?  

9. What quantitative metrics beyond semantic similarity could supplement analysis of language model responses to determine robustness?

10. How can the insights from AuditLLM be utilized by developers, researchers, and other stakeholders to improve language models? What changes might results motivate?
