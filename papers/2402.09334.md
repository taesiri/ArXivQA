# [AuditLLM: A Tool for Auditing Large Language Models Using Multiprobe   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical real-world applications, it becomes important to ensure they are safe, reliable and consistent. However, there is a lack of easy-to-use tools for auditing LLMs to probe them for potential inconsistencies which could indicate issues like bias or hallucinations. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces "AuditLLM", a novel tool for evaluating LLMs using a "multiprobe" approach. It generates multiple variations of a query to test if the LLM provides consistent responses. AuditLLM has two modes:

1) Live mode: Allows real-time auditing of an LLM by users entering a query and getting back probe questions generated by another LLM, along with the consistency-analyzed responses. 

2) Batch mode: Enables running multiple test queries together for more comprehensive auditing. Produces a report analyzing consistency across responses for the queries.

Key Contributions:
- Presents an easy-to-use tool for auditing LLMs using multiprobe questions to test consistency
- Live mode allows real-time probing of LLMs to quickly check for issues
- Batch mode facilitates large-scale auditing by testing multiple queries together  
- Provides quantitative consistency scores and visualizations to interpret audition results
- Can compare multiple LLMs to evaluate which is more robust and reliable

The tool enables both researchers and general users to better understand inconsistencies in LLM-generated responses on a common platform. It is designed to address the lack of consistency-focused LLM auditing tools.
