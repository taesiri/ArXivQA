# [Joint-Space Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Learned Decentralized   Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12385)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a method for multi-robot motion planning that combines centralized tree search with learned decentralized heuristics. Specifically, it trains a neural network policy to predict robot controls using local state information, as well as a learned cost-to-go heuristic. These decentralized heuristics are then integrated probabilistically into a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to guide the search direction and select appropriate nodes to expand from. Evaluated on environments with up to 16 robots, corresponding to a 65D state space, the method significantly outperforms baseline RRT in success rate, nodes expanded, and solution cost. The results demonstrate that augmenting sampling-based planners with neural heuristics enables effective high-dimensional search by decomposing the problem into more tractable local sub-problems. Key advantages are improved scalability over purely centralized methods, while retaining guarantees on completeness and optimality that decentralized multi-agent methods lack.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method of multi-robot motion planning that biases a centralized sampling-based tree search with learned decentralized steer and distance heuristics to effectively plan in high-dimensional joint spaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method of multi-robot motion planning that biases a centralized, sampling-based tree search algorithm (RRT) with learned, decentralized steer and distance heuristics. Specifically, the steer heuristic controls each robot towards a goal state, while the distance heuristic estimates the cost-to-go for each robot. These heuristics are trained using imitation learning and Deep Sets to handle varying numbers of robots. The method is evaluated on planning problems with up to 16 robots, showing improved performance over vanilla RRT in terms of success rate, nodes expanded, and path cost. The results demonstrate that the learned decentralized heuristics can effectively decompose the high-dimensional joint space planning problem into more tractable local planning problems.

The paper presents a method for multi-robot motion planning by biasing a centralized RRT planner with decentralized, data-driven steer and distance heuristics. Key aspects include using Deep Sets and imitation learning to train the heuristics, integrating them into RRT in a probabilistic way to maintain completeness guarantees, evaluating on double integrator dynamics, and demonstrating joint-space planning for up to 16 robots in a 65-dimensional space.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learned decentralized heuristics to guide a centralized RRT planner. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of this hybrid approach compared to using only decentralized or only centralized planning?

2. The steer and distance heuristics are trained using imitation learning from an expert centralized planner. How might the performance change if they were trained with reinforcement learning instead? What challenges would need to be addressed?

3. The distance heuristic is used to select the best node in the RRT to expand from. How sensitive is the performance to errors in this heuristic estimate of cost-to-go? Can you propose methods to make it more robust?  

4. The paper evaluates performance in terms of path cost, nodes expanded, success rate, etc. How might the performance change in dynamic environments where replanning is needed? Would the heuristics still be beneficial?

5. The neural network architectures for the heuristics use Deep Sets to encode variable numbers of neighboring robots and obstacles. What other network architectures could handle this permutation invariance? How might they compare?

6. How does the performance scale as the number of robots increases? At what point might the decentralized heuristics start to break down and fail to capture complex joint space interactions?

7. The heuristics are pre-trained on demonstration data from an expert planner. How might the performance change if they were trained online or adapted during planning? What are key challenges there?

8. What other variants of RRT could the heuristics be integrated with? Could they provide benefit to probabilistic completeness algorithms like RRT*?

9. The method decomposes the joint space planning problem into local planning problems. When might this decomposition fail and how could the method be made more robust?

10. The distance heuristic estimates cost-to-go, could it be extended to estimate chance of collision as well? How could that information be leveraged in the RRT variant?
