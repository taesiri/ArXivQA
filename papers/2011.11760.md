# [Multimodal Pretraining for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11760)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we leverage large amounts of unsupervised video and text data to improve dense video captioning models?

More specifically, some key aspects the paper investigates:

- They introduce a new dense video captioning dataset called ViTT (Video Timeline Tags) that has a more diverse range of topics compared to prior datasets like YouCook2 which focused only on cooking videos. A goal is to use this to better evaluate model generalization.

- They explore different multimodal pretraining strategies, including extending the MASS approach to the multimodal setting. The hypothesis is that leveraging large unlabeled video + text data can significantly improve downstream dense video captioning tasks.

- They perform experiments on YouCook2 and ViTT to compare no pretraining vs text-only pretraining vs multimodal pretraining. The results validate that MASS-style pretraining helps, with most of the gains coming from text-only pretraining.

- They analyze the performance on YouCook2 vs ViTT to show that models pretrained on diverse data generalize better to new topics, compared to models pretrained/finetuned on more narrow data.

In summary, the main research question is how to leverage unlabeled video and text data to improve dense video captioning models, with a focus on using methods like MASS-style pretraining and constructing more diverse datasets to improve generalization. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of different pretraining strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of a new dense video captioning dataset called ViTT (Video Timeline Tags). This dataset contains around 8,000 videos annotated with timeline tags, covering a broader range of instructional video topics compared to prior datasets like YouCook2 which focused only on cooking recipes.

2. Exploration of different multimodal sequence-to-sequence pretraining strategies for dense video captioning, using large unlabeled datasets of videos and caption-style texts. The pretraining approaches involve joint training of encoder and decoder models using objectives like MASS. 

3. Evaluation of dense video captioning models on YouCook2 and the new ViTT dataset, with and without the proposed pretraining strategies. The results show significant gains from pretraining, establishing new state-of-the-art on YouCook2. The models also generalize well to the more diverse ViTT dataset.

4. The findings indicate that most of the gains can be achieved through text-only pretraining leveraging automatic speech recognition, with smaller additional gains from incorporating visual pretraining. This suggests the importance of pretraining on in-domain textual data for instructional video understanding.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of different self-supervised pretraining methods for dense video captioning, enabled by the new ViTT dataset covering diverse instructional video topics. The pretraining strategies are shown to significantly improve over no pretraining and yield state-of-the-art results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding, a one-sentence summary of the key points in this paper could be:

The paper introduces a new dense video captioning dataset called Video Timeline Tags (ViTT) spanning diverse instructional videos, and shows that multimodal pretraining strategies leveraging large unlabeled video and text corpora lead to improved video captioning performance on ViTT and the existing YouCook2 benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new dense video captioning dataset called ViTT (Video Timeline Tags), which is larger and contains more diversity in topics compared to previous datasets like YouCook2 that focused solely on cooking videos. This addresses an important limitation and helps evaluate model generalization.

- For the video captioning task, the paper explores using multimodal pretraining strategies based on MASS, which pretrains both the encoder and decoder. This is different from prior work like VideoBERT and UniViLM that used BERT-style pretraining of just the encoder. The results demonstrate the benefits of joint pretraining of encoder-decoder for this task.

- The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 benchmark, outperforming prior published work. The models also generalize well to the new ViTT dataset, demonstrating their robustness.

- The paper provides an extensive set of ablation studies that help understand the contribution of different components like pretraining datasets, modalities, and modeling choices. The analysis shows most of the gains can be attributed to pretraining that leverages ASR, with smaller incremental gains from incorporating video.

- Compared to some prior work that relied on learning representations from scratch on a small dataset, this paper shows the value of pretraining on large datasets of instructional videos and text for this task. The pretrained models converge much faster and generalize better.

In summary, the paper makes solid contributions through creation of a new benchmark dataset, systematic investigation of different pretraining objectives, strong empirical results, and extensive analysis. The models and findings will likely provide a helpful starting point and baseline for future research on this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different visual features for video encoding, rather than using fixed pre-computed features like they did. The authors mention that learning the video features end-to-end may help improve performance.

- Trying different variants of multimodal pretraining objectives beyond the ones explored in this work, to see if they can further improve results.

- Evaluating the methods on additional dense video captioning datasets beyond YouCook2 and ViTT, to better understand model generalization.

- Exploring ways to reduce the amount of labeled data needed through semi-supervised or weakly supervised approaches.

- Applying the pretraining strategies to related multimodal tasks like video question answering or video retrieval.

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for this task, since some existing ones have limitations when dealing with short ground truth captions.

- Combining the timeline annotations produced by this work with other forms of video understanding like action localization or segmentation.

Overall, the authors suggest continuing to explore multimodal pretraining approaches, different model architectures, improvements to the visual encoding, semi-supervised techniques, and applications to related multimodal tasks as promising future directions to build on this work. Evaluating on more datasets and developing better evaluation metrics are also highlighted as important for continued progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new dense video captioning dataset called Video Timeline Tags (ViTT), which contains around 8,000 annotated instructional videos covering a diverse range of topics beyond just cooking. The dataset has an average of 7 timeline tags per video, with tags that are short free-text descriptions (on average 3 words) aimed at enabling video navigation. The authors explore various multimodal sequence-to-sequence pretraining strategies using large unlabeled video and text corpora, with the goal of video segment captioning. They compare no pretraining, text-only pretraining, and multimodal pretraining, evaluating on ViTT and YouCook2 benchmarks. The results demonstrate that text-only MASS-style pretraining provides significant gains over no pretraining, and captures most of the available performance, with multimodal pretraining giving small additional gains. The best models establish strong performance on ViTT and achieve state-of-the-art on YouCook2. This suggests the pretrained models generalize well across diverse instructional videos.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dense video captioning dataset called ViTT (Video Timeline Tags), which contains around 8,000 videos annotated with segment-level captions. Unlike prior datasets like YouCook2 that focus on cooking videos, ViTT has broader coverage of instructional videos on topics like car mechanics, makeup, smartphones, etc. The captions are meant to enable video navigation and are thus succinct tags averaging around 3 words per caption. The authors also explore different self-supervised pretraining strategies leveraging large unlabeled video and text corpora, adapting the MASS objective to the multimodal setting. They show that pretraining helps significantly, with most of the gains coming from leveraging ASR transcripts. The best results combine multimodal MASS pretraining with bidirectional finetuning, achieving state of the art on YouCook2 and strong baselines on ViTT. The models generalize well to the more diverse ViTT, indicating they are robust across different types of instructional videos.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) Introducing a new dense video captioning benchmark, ViTT, that has greater topic diversity compared to prior datasets. (2) Investigating different self-supervised pretraining approaches for instructional video captioning, showing that MASS-style pretraining brings significant gains, and that leveraging ASR helps more than video. (3) Achieving SOTA on YouCook2 and establishing strong baselines on ViTT, while demonstrating generalization across different types of instructional videos. The ViTT dataset and pretraining strategies enable building more robust dense video captioning models applicable to real-world applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores several multimodal sequence-to-sequence pretraining strategies for the task of dense video captioning. The main method involves using MASS-style pretraining (Masakhane et al., 2020) to pretrain both a multimodal encoder as well as a text decoder, using unlabeled instructional videos paired with unpaired instructional text data. Specifically, the multimodal encoder takes as input video frames paired with ASR transcripts, while the text decoder is pretrained using a denoising autoencoding objective on recipe step data and WikiHow articles. The encoder and decoder are pretrained jointly on a masked language modeling task, where segments of the ASR are masked and must be reconstructed by the decoder. After pretraining the encoder and decoder, the model is fine-tuned on dense video captioning datasets like YouCook2 and ViTT, where the goal is to generate a short text description for a given video segment. Both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + video) versions of the model are explored. The results demonstrate that leveraging large unlabeled multimodal and text-only corpora for pretraining significantly improves performance on downstream dense video captioning compared to training without pretraining.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of generating dense video captions for instructional videos. The key questions it seems to be tackling are:

1) How to construct a large and diverse dataset of instructional videos with dense captions for segments, to enable training and evaluating video captioning models that can generalize across topics. This motivates the creation of the new ViTT dataset.

2) How to leverage large amounts of unsupervised videos and text data to pretrain video captioning models, in order to improve performance on downstream dense video captioning tasks. This motivates exploring different multimodal pretraining objectives combining text and video encoders.

3) Whether models trained on existing cooking-focused dense captioning datasets like YouCook2 can generalize to instructional videos on a diverse set of topics. Evaluating on the new ViTT dataset, in addition to YouCook2, helps analyze model generalization.

4) What is the contribution of different modalities - text vs video vs both - for this task. This is analyzed via ablation studies training and evaluating models with different input/output configurations.

5) How multimodal pretraining, especially using text-only data, can improve state of the art on benchmark dense video captioning datasets like YouCook2.

In summary, the key focus seems to be on using new data and pretraining methods to develop video captioning models that can generalize across topics and leverage both text and visual modalities effectively. The ViTT dataset and exploration of different pretraining objectives are proposed to make progress on these goals.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dense video captioning dataset called Video Timeline Tags (ViTT). What motivated the authors to create this new dataset and how is it different from existing datasets like YouCook2? What are the key advantages of ViTT for training and evaluating dense video captioning models?

2. The paper explores several multimodal sequence-to-sequence pretraining strategies for dense video captioning. Can you explain the different pretraining objectives like MASS, MASSvid, MASSdrop, and MASSalign in more detail? What is the intuition behind using these different objectives? 

3. The authors find that text-only MASS pretraining captures most of the performance gains compared to no pretraining. Why do you think text-only pretraining is so effective despite not using the video modality? Is the visual information not that useful or are there other potential reasons?

4. The paper uses a separate-modality architecture with different Transformers for text and video instead of a concatenated architecture. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using this separate architecture? When might a concatenated architecture be preferred?

5. The authors use bidirectional finetuning (e.g. ASR->CAP and CAP->ASR) and find it beneficial. Why do you think training the model bidirectionally helps even when starting from a pretrained model? 

6. One finding is that the video features provide only a small additional boost over just using ASR. Do you think this conclusion could change with different or more informative video features? How important do you expect the choice of visual features to be?

7. The authors evaluate on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets. How well do you expect the models to generalize to instructional videos outside of these datasets? What other data might be needed to keep improving generalization?

8. The average tag length in ViTT is much shorter compared to YouCook2. How does this impact the models trained on each dataset? Would you expect different architectures or training to be beneficial when targeting short vs long captions?

9. The paper focuses on generating segment-level captions assuming segment boundaries are given. How feasible do you think it would be to extend this model to also localize the segments? What additional training or annotations might be needed?

10. The paper uses pretrained models like Compact Bilinear Pooling for visual features. Do you think end-to-end training of visual features would help compared to using fixed pretrained features? What are the tradeoffs to consider?
