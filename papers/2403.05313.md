# [RAT: Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in   Long-Horizon Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05313)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes generate incorrect or hallucinated information when performing complex, multi-step reasoning required in long-horizon generation tasks like code generation, mathematical reasoning, creative writing, and embodied task planning.  
- Simply combining retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with chain of thought (CoT) prompting in a naive way does not necessarily improve performance on these tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Thoughts (RAT), a method that synergizes RAG and CoT prompting to improve reasoning and mitigate hallucination in LLMs for long-horizon generation tasks.

Key Ideas of RAT:
1) Generate an initial zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) for the task using the LLM 
2) Use the task prompt and initial CoT as queries for RAG to retrieve relevant information from corpora/internet to help revise the potentially flawed CoT
3) Progressively revise each CoT step using the retrieved information - only revise the current step based on task prompt, current step, and previously revised steps (casual reasoning)

Evaluation:
- Evaluated RAT on code generation, math reasoning, embodied planning, and creative writing tasks using GPT-3.5, GPT-4, CodeLLAMA-7b
- RAT improves performance over vanilla CoT and RAG methods across tasks:
   - Code generation: 13.6% higher pass rate 
   - Math reasoning: 16.96% higher accuracy
   - Embodied planning: 2.96x executability, 51.94% higher plausibility  
   - Creative writing: 19.2% higher human rating
- Ablations show importance of progressive revision and retrieval strategy

Main Contributions:
- Novel prompting strategy RAT that combines strengths of CoT and RAG to improve complex reasoning and mitigate hallucination
- Demonstrated significant quantitative improvements from RAT over strong baselines across diverse long-horizon generation tasks
- Detailed analyses providing insights into how iterative, progressive revision and retrieval facilitates more grounded and accurate reasoning in LLMs

The paper shows RAT is an effective prompting technique for improving factuality and logical soundness in LLMs for complex, long-horizon generative tasks involving multiple steps of reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of a new method called "Retrieval Augmented Thoughts" (RAT). RAT is a technique that combines chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the reasoning ability and mitigate hallucination issues of large language models (LLMs) on complex, long-horizon generation tasks. 

Specifically, RAT works by first having the LLM generate an initial chain of thoughts in a zero-shot manner to solve the task. It then iteratively revises each thought step using relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source, taking into account the task prompt, current thought step, and previous thought steps. Finally, the LLM produces the final output based on the revised chain of thoughts in a progressive, step-by-step fashion.

The key ideas of RAT are: (1) revising potentially flawed initial thoughts from the LLM using RAG, and (2) a progressive revision and generation process that reasons causally about the evolving context.

Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that RAT substantially boosts the performance of LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and generation, including code generation, mathematical reasoning, embodied planning, and creative writing. The method mitigates hallucination issues while improving logical consistency and accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is the RAT technique for enhancing LLM reasoning and generation through targeted, progressive revision of thoughts via retrieval.

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords that appear most salient are:

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

- Long-horizon reasoning
- Long-horizon generation
- Context-aware reasoning
- Information retrieval
- Hallucination mitigation
- Zero-shot prompting

- Embodied task planning

The core focus seems to be on using retrieval augmented generation to help revise and improve the chain of thought reasoning process in large language models, in order to enhance performance on complex, long-horizon reasoning and generation tasks. The method aims to mitigate issues like hallucination while improving accuracy, completeness and reasoning ability. Key application domains tested include code generation, math reasoning, creative writing and embodied task planning scenarios.

In summary, the key terms cover the proposed method itself (retrieval augmented thoughts), the foundations it builds on (RAG, CoT, LLMs), the capabilities and tasks it targets (long-horizon reasoning/generation, context-aware reasoning), and the desired benefits it provides (hallucination mitigation, accuracy improvements).

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative process of revising the chain of thoughts using retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Could you explain more about how the query is generated at each iteration to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base? How is this query generation strategy superior to simply using the original question itself?

2. One of the key ideas in RAT is to revise the thoughts in a progressive, causal fashion instead of revising the complete chain of thoughts at once. What is the intuition behind this design choice? How does the experimental analysis demonstrate the advantages of causal vs non-causal reasoning? 

3. The paper evaluates RAT on several long-horizon reasoning tasks like code generation, mathematical reasoning, embodied planning etc. Could you elaborate on why RAT is particularly suited for such long-horizon tasks compared to vanilla CoT or RAG? What characteristics of the tasks make iterative retrieval valuable?

4. How robust is the RAT framework to variations in the base language models? Does it show consistent improvements irrespective of model scale or architecture? What differences did you observe when testing smaller vs larger models?

5. One concern raised is regarding inferior external knowledge bases leading to uninformative retrieval results. What strategies can be adopted to ensure high quality and relevant information sources for RAG? How can this impact be quantified empirically?

6. The query generation strategy relies on encoding the task prompt and thought steps into a single query. Could there be benefits in having multi-stage query formulations focused on specific sub-information? How can the query be optimized further?

7. For creative writing tasks, the paper utilizes generic web search rather than a domain-specific knowledge base. What are the tradeoffs in this approach? Could a hybrid strategy work better?

8. The paper focuses on open-ended, zero-shot prompting of the language models. How well would the RAT framework transfer to few-shot prompting demonstrations? Would additional tuning be valuable?

9. Annotation or verification of the revised thoughts after each RAG round could potentially enhance model performance. Is there scope to integrate these as additional steps in the pipeline? 

10. The RAT methodology does not involve any model training. Do you foresee benefits in complimentary tuning of language models to better leverage iterative retrieval with causal reasoning?
