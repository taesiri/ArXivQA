# [On-sensor Printed Machine Learning Classification via Bespoke ADC and   Decision Tree Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Printed electronics (PE) provide ultra-low cost hardware but have limitations like large feature sizes that restrict realizing complex circuits like machine learning classifiers. 
- Processing analog sensor data requires expensive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), dominating area/power of printed classifiers.
- Existing works on printed classifiers overlook ADC costs, and their efficiency is unclear.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a co-design framework to generate bespoke Decision Tree classifiers tailored to specific models and datasets.
- Use a parallel unary architecture to simplify Decision Tree to a two-stage logic, reducing area/power.  
- Design bespoke ADCs with only the bare minimum comparators needed, minimizing costs.
- Propose an ADC-aware training approach to identify parameters that minimize ADC hardware while maintaining accuracy.

Key Contributions:
- First work to consider and address impact of ADCs in designing printed digital ML classifiers
- Novel ADC-aware co-design framework for bespoke printed Decision Trees targeting self-powered operation
- Compared to state-of-the-art, the proposed solution reduces area and power of printed Decision Trees by average 8.6x and 12.2x for <1% accuracy loss
- For the first time, enables self-powered on-sensor digital ML classification in printed electronics

In summary, this paper identifies ADCs as a major bottleneck in realizing complex ML classifiers using printed electronics. To address this, the proposed ADC-aware co-design framework tailors Decision Tree classifiers and ADCs to minimize hardware overheads. This unprecedented level of customization enables self-powered printed classifiers suitable for on-sensor processing.
