# [CriticBench: Evaluating Large Language Models as Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Critique abilities of large language models (LLMs) are crucial for their scalable oversight and self-improvement, but evaluating these abilities is still underexplored. 
- Existing works have limitations in assessing critique abilities across diverse dimensions, tasks, and response qualities.
- Lacking comprehensive analysis also hinders advancing critique capabilities of LLMs.

Proposed Solution - CriticBench Benchmark:  
- Comprehensively evaluates 4 key critique dimensions - feedback, comparison, refinement, and meta-feedback.
- Covers 9 diverse tasks - translation, summarization, QA, chat, harmlessness, math reasoning, and coding.
- Assesses varying response quality levels - low, medium, high, and correct.  
- Employs both scalar and free-form textual critiques.
- Leverages both objective metrics and subjective human judgments with reference annotations.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the first comprehensive and reliable benchmark for evaluating LLM critique abilities.
- Analysis reveals insights on relationships between critique performance and tasks, dimensions, response qualities, model scale.  
- Benchmark enables in-depth understanding and further improvement of LLM critique capabilities.
- Shows promising progress of open-source LLMs approaching state-of-the-art on critique abilities.

In summary, the paper introduces CriticBench, a novel diverse benchmark for comprehensively and reliably assessing the critique capabilities of LLMs across key dimensions, tasks, and response qualities. Extensive analysis provides valuable discoveries into critique abilities to facilitate advancing LLM self-improvement and oversight.
