# [A User-Friendly Framework for Generating Model-Preferred Prompts in   Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion can generate impressive images from text prompts, but require high-quality prompts. Novice users struggle to write good prompts leading to poor results. 
- There is a discrepancy between prompts novice users provide and prompts the model is trained on. Novice users tend to provide shorter, coarse-grained prompts compared to longer, more descriptive prompts in training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a new dataset called Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts (CFP) dataset with 81,910 triplets of (1) fine-grained prompt, (2) corresponding image and (3) coarse-grained version of prompt summarized from the fine-grained prompt.

- Propose a User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation (UF-FGTG) framework to automatically convert coarse-grained prompts from users into fine-grained, model-preferred prompts for better image generation.

- Key components of UF-FGTG:
   - Prompt refiner to transform coarse prompts to fine-grained ones
   - Incorporate image-related loss from Stable Diffusion model to ensure generated prompts are model-preferred
   - Adaptive feature extraction module to align prompt and image features to ensure diversity in generated images

Main Contributions:
- Novel CFP dataset to bridge gap between user prompts and model preferred prompts
- UF-FGTG framework to automatically translate user prompts into model preferred prompts 
- Adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in generated images
- Experiments show method improves image quality and aesthetics by 5% on average over baselines

The paper addresses an important problem in text-to-image generation regarding the discrepancy between novice user prompts and model-preferred prompts. The proposed CFP dataset and UF-FGTG framework provide an effective solution through automated fine-grained prompt generation while ensuring diversity. Key strengths are the interpretable data-driven approach and quantitative experiments demonstrating improvements.
