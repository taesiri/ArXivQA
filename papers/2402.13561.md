# [Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper: Advancing Multimodal Comprehension   with Enhanced Visual Knowledge Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) can perform well on visual question answering (VQA) but still struggle with knowledge-based VQA which requires external knowledge to answer questions about images. 
- Current LMMs focus on aligning image-text descriptions and overlook aligning images with relevant knowledge (visual-knowledge alignment). Visual knowledge is important for analyzing, inferring and interpreting information from images.

Proposed Solution: 
- Present a Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM) with two components to improve LMMs:
   1) Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA): Generates relevant knowledge for images and projects it into the language space of LMMs. It is pretrained on image-knowledge pairs and fine-tuned using query tokens and a linear layer.
   2) Fine-Grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA): Distills and injects fine-grained visual knowledge from image regions into each layer of the LMM.
- VKA connects images to knowledge. FKA provides detailed knowledge to improve reasoning abilities of LMMs.

Main Contributions:
- Explore visual-language knowledge alignment in LMMs by associating images with knowledge (VKA) and distilling detailed knowledge (FKA). 
- VKA is pretrained on image-knowledge pairs from Wikipedia and fine-tuned to project knowledge into LMMs.
- FKA adapts and injects fine-grained knowledge from image regions into the LMM.
- Experiments show CVLM outperforms previous LMMs on knowledge-based VQA datasets by 4-5%. Ablations validate effectiveness of VKA and FKA.

In summary, the paper introduces techniques to align images with visual knowledge and inject it into LMMs to enhance performance on knowledge-based VQA tasks. The VKA and FKA components are shown to be effective through quantitative results and ablations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM) with a Visual Knowledge Aligner and Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter to achieve visual-language knowledge alignment, connecting visuals to relevant knowledge and injecting it into language models to improve their performance on knowledge-based visual question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting a cognitive visual-language mapper (CVLM) to achieve visual-language knowledge alignment, which contains a pretrained visual knowledge aligner (VKA) and a fine-grained knowledge adapter (FKA) used during multimodal instruction tuning.

2. Being the first to explore visual-language knowledge alignment during the pretraining and finetuning stages of large multimodal models (LMMs), connecting visuals to their relevant knowledge via CVLM. 

3. Experimental results showing that CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-intensive visual question answering. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of VKA and FKA.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing methods to align visual and language knowledge to improve LMMs for knowledge-based tasks, as well as providing experimental validation of this approach.
