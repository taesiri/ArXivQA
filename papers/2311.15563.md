# [Noisy Self-Training with Synthetic Queries for Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15563)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel self-training framework to improve neural dense retrievers using automatically generated queries. A teacher model first trains on labeled data. Then, a query generator synthesizes queries for each passage to create unlabeled query-passage pairs. The teacher uses these pairs to generate soft pseudo-labels, providing more robust supervision than hard synthetic labels. A student model trains on the soft-labeled synthetic data, with noise injection into its inputs to prevent overfitting to the teacher. This noisy self-training allows the student model to improve in a self-evolving manner without external models. Experiments on general domain (MS-MARCO, Natural Questions) and out-of-domain (BEIR) benchmarks show consistent and significant gains over state-of-the-art methods. The approach also improves sample efficiency, achieving strong performance with 30% less labeled data. Additionally, the method extends to boost cross-encoder rerankers. The self-evolutionary capability allows continuous relabeling and retraining for further gains. Overall, this paper presents an effective and general framework to improve neural retrievers and rerankers using synthetic queries and noisy self-training.

2. Experimental results on general-domain benchmarks show the proposed framework can significantly boost the performance of state-of-the-art neural retrievers. It also yields superior results in low-resource settings.

3. Further experiments on the out-of-domain BEIR benchmark show improved performance for both neural retrievers and rerankers compared to a series of strong baseline models. The framework is shown to be general and effective for domain adaptation.

4. The framework improves models in a self-evolution manner without relying on any external models, while significantly reducing training time and improving efficiency compared to prior work.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel self-training framework that can effectively utilize synthetic queries to improve neural retrievers and rerankers in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a noisy self-training framework combined with synthetic queries. Can you explain in detail how the framework works and the rationale behind each component? 

2. One key contribution is using the retriever itself to generate soft labels on synthetic queries. Why is this more beneficial than using an external model or hard labels on synthetic data?

3. Noise injection is utilized during self-training. What are the different noise injection strategies and what is the motivation behind them? How do they improve model robustness?

4. The method is evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Can you summarize the main results on both settings and discuss why the method works well? 

5. Ablation studies are conducted in Table 4. Can you walk through the key findings and explain what they tell us about the model components? 

6. Figure 3 shows the model is more robust to shuffled input queries. Why would this be an advantageous property for a retriever to have? And how does noise injection during training lead to this?

7. The method is adapted to improve a cross-encoder reranker. How is the training framework modified for this? And what performance gains are achieved on the reranking task?

8. For out-of-domain evaluation, the model training process can be viewed as a form of unsupervised domain adaptation. Explain how the components enable more effective domain transfer. 

9. Analyze the quality of the soft labels for synthetic queries based on the manual examination. What proportion are correctly labeled and why is this still beneficial?

10. The performance diminishes with more self-training iterations. What could be some potential reasons behind this? How can it be alleviated?
