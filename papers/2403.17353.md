# [Multi-Objective Trajectory Planning with Dual-Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Time-jerk optimal trajectory planning for robotic arms is crucial for enhancing productivity and stability in dynamic tasks. However, traditional optimization methods like genetic algorithms or sequential quadratic programming are computationally expensive. Supervised learning models can generate trajectories faster but lack robustness. Thus, there is a need for an approach balancing efficiency and optimality.

Proposed Solution:  
A two-stage approach is proposed. First, a dual-encoder transformer model is designed, consisting of a source encoder to represent joint dynamics and a context encoder to capture kinematic relations between joints. The model is trained on time-jerk optimal trajectories to predict good initial trajectory estimates. These estimates are refined using sequential quadratic programming to improve optimality and robustness.

Key Contributions:
1) A dual-encoder transformer to predict initial estimates for sequential quadratic programming trajectory optimization. This expedites overall time-jerk optimal trajectory generation.

2) State-of-the-art performance over other optimization methods like NSGA-II and supervised learning models like LSTM, reducing planning time by up to 79.72% while decreasing objective function value by up to 29.9%.

3) An approach balancing computational efficiency and robustness for multi-objective trajectory planning. Can generalize well across varying trajectory lengths.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient two-stage technique leveraging neural networks and optimization to enhance time-jerk optimal trajectory planning for robotic manipulators. The efficiency, optimality and generalization capability of the proposed solution are highlighted as main contributions.
