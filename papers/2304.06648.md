# [DiffFit: Unlocking Transferability of Large Diffusion Models via Simple   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06648)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a simple yet effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy called DiffFit for large pre-trained diffusion models like DiT. 

- The main goal is to enable fast adaptation of such models to new domains/datasets without compromising performance while being efficient in terms of computations and storage.

- The central hypothesis is that fine-tuning only the bias terms and adding learnable scaling factors in certain layers would suffice for fast adaptation while requiring much fewer trainable parameters and computations compared to full fine-tuning.

- Experiments on 8 downstream datasets validate this hypothesis, showing DiffFit achieves superior or competitive results to full fine-tuning using only 0.12% of the parameters and 2x faster training.

- Further experiments surprisingly show DiffFit can also effectively adapt a pretrained low-resolution model to high-resolution by treating it as a domain shift problem.

- Theoretical analysis provides intuitions on why tuning scaling factors enables matching shifted distributions.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that fine-tuning only bias and scaling factors is sufficient for fast and efficient diffusion model adaptation across domains and resolutions, which is validated empirically and theoretically. The key research question is whether this simple yet effective strategy can unlock transferability of large diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 From my understanding, the key contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes DiffFit, a simple yet effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy for large pre-trained diffusion models like DiT. By only fine-tuning the bias terms and scaling factors in the model, DiffFit enables fast adaptation to new datasets and domains while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.

2. It provides both empirical results and intuitive theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffFit. Experiments on 8 downstream datasets show DiffFit can match or outperform full fine-tuning and other fine-tuning methods in terms of FID while using only 0.12% of the total parameters. The theory offers insight into why the scaling factors help shift distributions.

3. It shows DiffFit can readily adapt a pre-trained low-resolution model to high-resolution generation by treating it as a domain shift problem. On ImageNet 512x512, DiffFit fine-tuned from a 256x256 checkpoint achieves state-of-the-art FID of 3.02 among diffusion models, while reducing training time by 30x compared to training from scratch.

4. The simplicity and strong performance of DiffFit establishes it as a highly efficient and effective baseline for fine-tuning large generative models. It provides a principle for scaling up diffusion models and transferring them to new domains and tasks with minimal cost.

In summary, the key innovation is the propose of DiffFit for inexpensive and fast fine-tuning of large pre-trained diffusion models via only adjusting bias terms and scaling factors. This unlocks the transferability of these expensive models to new domains at a fraction of the original training cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to prior work on diffusion models for image generation:

- It proposes a simple yet effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called DiffFit for adapting large pre-trained diffusion models to new datasets/domains. DiffFit only fine-tunes the bias terms and some scaling factors, reducing the number of trainable parameters to 0.12% of the full model. This is much more efficient than full fine-tuning or other methods like adaptors or prompt tuning.

- The paper shows strong empirical results with DiffFit, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet 512x512 generation while requiring 30x less training time than previous methods. DiffFit also achieves the best average FID score across 8 downstream datasets compared to other fine-tuning techniques.

- The paper provides intuitive theoretical analysis on why fine-tuning the scaling factors allows efficient adaptation to new distributions. This kind of analysis is novel compared to most prior work which is purely empirical.

- The paper demonstrates that DiffFit can effectively adapt a pre-trained low-resolution model to high-resolution generation by treating it as a domain shift problem. This is a simple but impactful finding not explored in previous work. 

- Compared to concurrent work like BitFit, DiffFit further introduces scaling factors that help align features and achieve better adaptation performance. The ablation studies provide insights on how to effectively incorporate the scaling factors.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundary on efficient fine-tuning of large diffusion models. The simple yet effective DiffFit approach and strong results advance the state-of-the-art in this field. The analysis and findings related to scaling factors and resolution adaptation also provide new insights compared to prior literature.
