# [State of What Art? A Call for Multi-Prompt LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00595)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current LLM evaluations typically rely on performance using a single task prompt/instruction template. However, there are many ways to phrase instructions for a task.
- The paper shows that both absolute and relative LLM performance can vary widely based on small instruction variations. So evaluations using a single prompt give limited and brittle insights.

Solution:
- The authors generate thousands of prompt variations for tasks from 3 popular benchmarks. Both automatic and manual paraphrasing methods are used.
- They systematically evaluate performance across prompts and models, quantifying the variance. Rankings and scores change drastically based on prompt choice.

- They argue evaluations should use a diverse prompt set, tailored to different real-world use cases:
  - LLM developers may want average performance across prompts to measure robustness.
  - Downstream task developers care about maximum prompt performance.
  - Open domains need metrics balancing peak & robust performance.

- Different metrics are proposed for these cases - max perf, average perf, saturation (peak vs avg), and combined score.

Contributions:
- First large-scale analysis quantifying performance variance on paraphrasing (over 6.5M samples covering 20 LLMs).
- Argument for closer coupling of evaluation practices to real-world use cases. 
- New evaluation protocol and metrics using a diverse prompt set instead of one template.

The paper makes an important contribution in demonstrating and quantifying the brittleness of single-prompt evaluations. It makes a case for more comprehensive analysis before drawing conclusions about model capabilities. The proposed metrics provide a more reliable assessment tailored to different real-world needs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper argues that evaluating language models on a single prompt template per task leads to unreliable results, and proposes using multiple prompt templates per task along with tailored metrics aligned with real-world use cases to enable more robust comparisons of model capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Showing that large language model (LLM) performance is very sensitive to how task instructions are phrased, with minor paraphrasing often leading to major differences in accuracy and relative model rankings. This challenges the adequacy of evaluating LLMs on a single instruction template per task.

2. Proposing new evaluation metrics tailored to different real-world use cases, such as maximum performance for a downstream task, average performance for model developers, saturation for open-ended uses, and a combined score. 

3. Conducting a comprehensive analysis on over 6.5 million LLM evaluation instances, finding that model rankings and capabilities vary substantially depending on the evaluation metric used. This suggests the importance of choosing metrics aligned with intended applications.

4. Releasing a dataset of over 5,000 manually verified task instruction paraphrases to enable further research into robust LLM evaluation.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the brittleness of single-prompt LLM evaluation, advocates for multi-prompt evaluation strategies, and provides insights into selecting appropriate evaluation metrics based on end goals. The analysis and dataset aim to spur more rigorous and generalizable LLM assessments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that current LLM evaluation practices using a single prompt per task lead to brittle results. What evidence does the paper provide to support this claim? How compelling is this evidence?

2. The paper proposes evaluating models using multiple prompts per task. What are some of the key challenges in creating a robust and diverse set of prompt paraphrases for a given task? How well does the paper address these challenges?

3. The paper introduces four new multi-prompt evaluation metrics tailored to different use cases. Which use case do you think is most relevant and why? Are there any other important use cases not covered by these metrics?  

4. One of the proposed metrics averages performance across many prompt paraphrases. What are the benefits and limitations of using average performance to assess model capabilities? How might this depend on the diversity and quality of prompts?

5. How might the choice of paraphrasing method impact the metrics proposed in the paper? For example, could automated paraphrasing lead to biased estimates of model performance? How could this be addressed?

6. The paper argues for choosing evaluation metrics based on extrinsic real-world needs. Do you agree with this viewpoint? If not, what principles should guide the choice of evaluation metrics instead?  

7. The paper finds that model rankings diverge substantially between metrics. What implications does this have for how we interpret and compare model benchmark results? Are the inconsistencies necessarily problematic?

8. How sensitive are the proposed multi-prompt evaluation metrics to the selection of tasks used for assessment? Could the choice of tasks favor certain models over others? How could this be mitigated?  

9. The paper focuses exclusively on evaluating English language models. How well do you expect the proposed methods to transfer to evaluating multilingual models? What complications might arise?

10. The authors argue that single prompt evaluations lead to unreliable model comparisons. Do you think single-prompt human evaluations would encounter similar issues? Why or why not?
