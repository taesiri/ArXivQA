# [k* Distribution: Evaluating the Latent Space of Deep Neural Networks   using Local Neighborhood Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04024)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new methodology called the k* distribution to analyze the latent space learned by neural networks. The key idea is to examine the local neighborhood relationships and homogeneity around individual samples using a nearest neighbors approach. The index of the nearest neighbor from a different class (termed k*) quantifies where the local homogeneity breaks down. Distributions of k* values are then aggregated for samples of a given class, enabling the identification of three primary patterns: (A) Fractured distributions indicate multiple separated clusters of the class samples. (B) Overlapped distributions signify intermixing between classes. (C) Clustered distributions demonstrate dense, homogeneous groups of the class. Experiments apply k* analysis to study factors like model architecture, model layers, training data, robustness techniques, and input transformations. For instance, the paper shows robust models tend to be more fractured, while higher performance correlates with more clustered distributions. Overall, the k* methodology facilitates straightforward comparisons, reveals new insights into latent space configurations, and can be widely applied to enhance understanding of neural networks.
