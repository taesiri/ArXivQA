# [Symmetry-Breaking Augmentations for Ad Hoc Teamwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Symmetry-Breaking Augmentations for Ad Hoc Teamwork":

Problem:
In multi-agent settings, agents need to coordinate and adapt to the behaviors and conventions of new teammates they have not seen before. This is challenging as independently trained agents often develop incompatible conventions. For example, agents trained to only drive on one side of the road may fail to coordinate with drivers who drive on the opposite side, even if their behaviors are symmetrical.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "symmetry-breaking augmentations" (SBA), a technique to augment and diversify the training teammates to expose the agent to a wider range of conventions. SBA works by applying symmetry-flipping operations during training to create augmented versions of the teammates with different conventions. By learning to best respond to these augmented teammates, the agent becomes robust to more conventions.

For example, a traffic conductor learning to direct drivers has its training augmented with drivers stopping/going on different colors. This prevents overfitting to any specific color convention and enables adaptation to new drivers.

The SBA objective is to maximize the expected return against teammates sampled from the training population and symmetry transformations sampled from the set of known environment symmetries.

The paper also introduces the "Augmentation Impact" metric to quantify how much applying SBA to a population diversifies agent behaviors, which predicts how effective SBA will be.

Contributions:

- Symmetry-breaking augmentations (SBA), a general and scalable method to augment training teammates to expose agents to more behavioral conventions

- Augmentation Impact metric to estimate effectiveness of augmentation techniques 

- Evaluated SBA in iterated matrix game and Hanabi game, showing SBA agents adapt much better to new teammates

- SBA achieves new state-of-the-art performance for ad hoc teamwork in Hanabi game

In summary, the paper presents a method to improve coordination and adaptation skills of learning agents through symmetry-based data augmentation, with strong experimental results demonstrating the benefits of the approach.
