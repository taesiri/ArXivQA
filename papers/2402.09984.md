# [Symmetry-Breaking Augmentations for Ad Hoc Teamwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Symmetry-Breaking Augmentations for Ad Hoc Teamwork":

Problem:
In multi-agent settings, agents need to coordinate and adapt to the behaviors and conventions of new teammates they have not seen before. This is challenging as independently trained agents often develop incompatible conventions. For example, agents trained to only drive on one side of the road may fail to coordinate with drivers who drive on the opposite side, even if their behaviors are symmetrical.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "symmetry-breaking augmentations" (SBA), a technique to augment and diversify the training teammates to expose the agent to a wider range of conventions. SBA works by applying symmetry-flipping operations during training to create augmented versions of the teammates with different conventions. By learning to best respond to these augmented teammates, the agent becomes robust to more conventions.

For example, a traffic conductor learning to direct drivers has its training augmented with drivers stopping/going on different colors. This prevents overfitting to any specific color convention and enables adaptation to new drivers.

The SBA objective is to maximize the expected return against teammates sampled from the training population and symmetry transformations sampled from the set of known environment symmetries.

The paper also introduces the "Augmentation Impact" metric to quantify how much applying SBA to a population diversifies agent behaviors, which predicts how effective SBA will be.

Contributions:

- Symmetry-breaking augmentations (SBA), a general and scalable method to augment training teammates to expose agents to more behavioral conventions

- Augmentation Impact metric to estimate effectiveness of augmentation techniques 

- Evaluated SBA in iterated matrix game and Hanabi game, showing SBA agents adapt much better to new teammates

- SBA achieves new state-of-the-art performance for ad hoc teamwork in Hanabi game

In summary, the paper presents a method to improve coordination and adaptation skills of learning agents through symmetry-based data augmentation, with strong experimental results demonstrating the benefits of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces symmetry-breaking augmentations, a method that improves ad hoc teamwork in multi-agent systems by augmenting the training data to expose agents to more diverse conventions, making them better able to coordinate with novel partners at test time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing "symmetry-breaking augmentations" (SBA), a method to improve ad hoc teamwork by augmenting the training teammates to expose the ad hoc agent to a more diverse set of conventions during training. Specifically:

- SBA applies symmetry transformations (permutations) to the observations and actions of the ad hoc agent when interacting with teammates during training. This exposes the agent to teammates using a wider range of conventions without needing to actually alter the teammates themselves.

- They introduce a metric called "Augmentation Impact" to quantify how much applying SBA transformations diversifies a set of policies. This helps select good training populations. 

- They demonstrate SBA in the Hanabi card game, showing it improves ad hoc teamwork performance by 17% over baseline methods when evaluated on held out teammates. SBA also achieves state of the art results on Hanabi for this setting.

- The method is general, improving ad hoc teamwork in another simple coordination game, and can work with any learning algorithm.

In summary, SBA better exposes agents to diverse conventions during training, making them more robust when collaborating with new partners at test time. This improves ad hoc coordination.

The paper introduces "symmetry-breaking augmentations" (SBA), a method to improve an agent's ability to collaborate effectively with novel teammates in ad hoc teamwork settings. Key ideas explored are using SBA to amplify the diversity of conventions that a reinforcement learning agent is exposed to during training, evaluating SBA in the cooperative card game Hanabi, and measuring how much an augmentation technique like SBA diversifies behaviors in a training population of policies using a proposed "Augmentation Impact" metric. The goal is to reduce overfitting to certain conventions and improve generalization to new, unseen teammates. Related concepts touched on include best response learning, zero-shot coordination, and the role of social conventions in facilitating multi-agent collaboration.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the symmetry-breaking augmentations (SBA) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims that SBA improves performance when generalizing outside the training distribution to Other Play agents. However, the results in Table 2 show mixed performance, with SBA harming performance when trained on SAD and tested on OBL. Why does SBA fail to improve generalization performance in this case? 

2. The Augmentation Impact metric calculates the difference in crossplay score from applying symmetries between policy pairs. How sensitive is this metric to the choice of symmetries used? Does using different symmetries significantly change the AugImp score?

3. When trained with medium-sized SAD and IQL populations, SBA shows much greater performance improvements for SAD (17%) compared to IQL (7%). Why does SBA have a bigger impact when the training population has stronger symmetry-breaking conventions?

4. The paper hypothesizes that SBA harms performance with OBL partners because it provides fewer color hints. Does directly altering the hinting behavior of SBA agents support this hypothesis? Are there other factors that could explain the performance drop?

5. How does the performance of SBA agents change as the number of symmetries used for augmentation increases? Is there a point where too many symmetries reduce performance due to overfitting issues? 

6. Could the ideas behind SBA be extended to other domains like computer vision or robotic manipulation where there are also symmetries present? What challenges might arise in applying SBA in those settings?

7. The paper evaluates SBA using independent Q-learning. How does SBA perform using other deep multi-agent RL algorithms like QMIX or MADDPG? Do the performance improvements transfer across algorithms?

8. When applying SBA during training, policies are sampled uniformly from the population and symmetries. Does adaptively sampling policies and symmetries lead to better performance? 

9. For real world deployment, how can we estimate symmetries and measure AugImp when we only have access to behavioral data from agents rather than internal policies?

10. The paper focuses on fully cooperative tasks, but could SBA also improve coordination in mixed cooperative-competitive environments? What new challenges arise in those settings?
