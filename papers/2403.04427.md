# [Sentiment-driven prediction of financial returns: a Bayesian-enhanced   FinBERT approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Accurately predicting financial market returns is challenging due to inherent uncertainty in financial time series data. Capturing both social and financial sentiment is key to enhancing prediction model performance.

Proposed Solution  
- Leverage sentiment information extracted from StockTwits tweets using the FinBERT neural language model to predict S&P500 ETF (SPY) return signs.
- Conduct correlation analysis to identify optimal feature set capturing sentiment dynamics over different time lags.
- Compare three model architectures with different feature sets and training window sizes:
   1) Literature benchmark model
   2) BO-RFE-2 model with 2 features
   3) BO-RFE-5 model with 5 features, including correlation-based features
- Use same SVM-based prediction model for all architectures.  

Key Contributions
- BO-RFE feature selection combined with correlation analysis extracts superior feature set compared to literature benchmark, achieving over 70% F1 score.
- Correlation analysis reveals weekly seasonality in sentiment-return relationship, contributing features to BO-RFE-5 model.  
- Sentiment features play crucial role, occupying 80% of features in BO-RFE-5 vs 30% in benchmark.
- Reduced features enables shorter training window, enhancing model responsiveness.
- Sign prediction accuracy translates to higher cumulative profits during backtested trading simulation.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the significance of optimal feature selection, exploiting sentiment dynamics over different time lags, in improving financial return sign prediction accuracy and trading performance using the same underlying SVM model.
