# [Towards mitigating uncann(eye)ness in face swaps via gaze-centric loss   terms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances have enabled highly realistic face swapping, but these swapped faces are still perceived differently than real faces. A key difference is in viewer behavior surrounding the eyes.
- Face swapping models don't explicitly focus on reconstructing the eyes well, instead using loss functions that consider the whole face equally. This leads to lower quality eyes. 
- The authors hypothesize that the poor eye reconstructions contribute to an "uncanny valley" effect where the swapped faces seem unnatural.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors first confirm that face swaps elicit more uncanny feelings in viewers compared to real videos.
- They propose a new loss function to train face swap models that leverages a pretrained gaze estimation network. This provides an explicit focus on accurately reconstructing the gaze direction.
- The gaze loss term penalizes errors between the predicted gaze angles of the original and reconstructed faces.

Contributions:
- First work analyzing face swaps under the lens of the uncanny valley, showing they do tend to be perceived as uncanny.
- Novel gaze-centric loss function for face swap training that significantly improves gaze direction over baseline methods.
- Analysis showing the improved gaze reconstructions make the eyes less reliable for human detection of face swaps.
- Modular contribution allowing gaze constraints to be incorporated into many face swap training regimes.

In summary, this work analyzes the uncanniness of face swaps and proposes a new training approach to improve gaze reconstruction. This is shown to impact human perception and could alleviate negative responses that limit applications of the technology.
