## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview and comparison of major AI competition platforms. It first defines the key ingredients of an AI competition based on the Common Task Framework. It then lays out the main responsibilities that need to be fulfilled in running a competition, which are shared between organizers and platforms. Next, it introduces criteria for comparing platforms such as design support, data support, registered users, entries, code sharing abilities, custom metrics, staged challenges, solution publication, free hosting options, and open source availability. It then systematically compares the features of leading generalist platforms like AICrowd, CodaLab, DrivenData, EvalAI, Kaggle, Tianchi, and Zindi across these criteria. The paper also briefly covers non-English language platforms, domain-specific platforms, alternative collaboration approaches beyond competitions, and examples of independently hosted competitions. Finally, it provides advice on choosing the right platform based on factors like budget, audience, requirements around evaluations, and community. The table comparing features of platforms across various criteria is a particularly valuable reference that competition organizers can use to select the platform best suited to their needs.

- Outlines key criteria for evaluating and comparing competition platforms, including design support, data support, registered users, typical entries, code sharing capabilities, custom metric support, etc. 

- Presents a table clearly comparing the features and capabilities of the major generalist platforms across these criteria.

- Gives highlights and key facts about several of the most popular platforms.

- Discusses alternative approaches beyond just competition platforms, like Amazon Mechanical Turk, Zooniverse, OpenML, and tools for ML experiment tracking. 

- Provides advice on choosing the best platform for different types of competitions.

So in summary, the paper delivers a very useful, structured overview of the AI competition platform landscape, including feature comparisons and recommendations, which can serve as a reference for competition organizers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods and content in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that most competition organizers use a competition platform to host their events. What are some of the key factors that drive organizers to use platforms rather than self-hosting competitions? What capabilities do platforms provide?

2. The paper discusses the "Common Task Framework" as a way to conceptualize the ingredients of an AI competition. How well does this framework capture the breadth of possible competition formats? What aspects are missing or could be expanded? 

3. Table 1 offers a high-level comparison of features across platforms. What other criteria could be considered to further differentiate platforms? What additional pros/cons of each platform are worth calling out?  

4. The paper cites the ability for competitors to share code as an important collaboration feature. What are some ways platforms could make code sharing even more impactful? How might this feature evolve in the future?

5. Several niche, domain-specific platforms are discussed. What unique capabilities must these platforms provide to properly support competitions in their target field? What common platform features become less important?  

6. The "Alternative Approaches" section covers adjacent services like AMT and Zooniverse. How do the incentives and interactions in these communities compare to traditional AI competitions? What lessons can be learned?

7. What potential downsides exist when organizers choose to self-host competitions rather than leveraging a platform? When does self-hosting make the most sense despite the extra effort required?  

8. How might the platform landscape change in the next 3-5 years? Will new specialty platforms emerge? Will new features become table stakes? 

9. What responsibilities do platforms have when it comes to promoting responsible/ethical AI practices? Should platforms screen competitions before launch?

10. If you were designing a new competition platform from scratch, what would your priorities be? What gaps exist in the current marketplace you would try to fill?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive overview and comparison of major AI competition platforms. AI competitions bring together researchers, companies, and enthusiasts to collaboratively solve challenging problems. Most organizers use a dedicated platform to host their competitions and manage administrative tasks. 

The paper first defines the key ingredients of an AI competition based on the common task framework: 1) training data 2) enrolled competitors 3) a scoring referee. It then maps these to a list of platform responsibilities: design, data, discovery, admin, engagement, scoring, dissemination.

The main comparison criteria covered are: design support, data support, registered users, typical entries, code sharing abilities, custom evaluation options, staged challenges, private evaluation, RL evaluation, human evaluation, solution publication, free hosting availability, and open source status. 

The platforms compared in depth are: AIcrowd, CodaLab, DrivenData, EvalAI, Kaggle, Tianchi, and Zindi. Key highlights for some platforms: CodaLab is open source, DrivenData focuses on social impact, EvalAI specializes in human evaluation, Kaggle has over 10 million users, Tianchi targets Chinese audiences.  

The paper also covers non-English platforms like Signate (Japan), Open Data Science (Russia), and several Chinese platforms. It mentions domain-specific platforms like Numerai (finance), Grand Challenge (biomedical imaging), NASA Tournament Lab (aerospace).

Alternative approaches beyond competition platforms are also summarized, like Amazon Mechanical Turk for human evaluation, Zooniverse for citizen science, OpenML for ML experiment tracking, PapersWithCode for SOTA benchmarking, etc. 

Finally, the paper provides advice for choosing a suitable platform based on factors like budget, audience, requirements around data privacy or evaluation complexity. It also mentions some examples of independently hosted competitions like the MIT Battlecode game and robotics contests.

The key contribution is asingle source covering the AI competition landscape that competition organizers can use to select the best platform for their needs based on key criteria. The paper aims to grow awareness of this ecosystem and increase open collaboration.
