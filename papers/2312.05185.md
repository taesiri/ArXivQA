# [AI Competitions and Benchmarks: Competition platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05185)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview and comparison of major AI competition platforms. It first defines the key ingredients of an AI competition based on the Common Task Framework. It then lays out the main responsibilities that need to be fulfilled in running a competition, which are shared between organizers and platforms. Next, it introduces criteria for comparing platforms such as design support, data support, registered users, entries, code sharing abilities, custom metrics, staged challenges, solution publication, free hosting options, and open source availability. It then systematically compares the features of leading generalist platforms like AICrowd, CodaLab, DrivenData, EvalAI, Kaggle, Tianchi, and Zindi across these criteria. The paper also briefly covers non-English language platforms, domain-specific platforms, alternative collaboration approaches beyond competitions, and examples of independently hosted competitions. Finally, it provides advice on choosing the right platform based on factors like budget, audience, requirements around evaluations, and community. The table comparing features of platforms across various criteria is a particularly valuable reference that competition organizers can use to select the platform best suited to their needs.
