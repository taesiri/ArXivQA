# [Target-constrained Bidirectional Planning for Generation of   Target-oriented Proactive Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06063)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper explores the task of target-oriented proactive dialogue generation, where the system needs to lead the conversation towards a pre-determined target (e.g. recommending a specific movie). This is challenging because the system has to proactively drive the dialogue while also moving it smoothly towards the target topic to arouse the user's interest. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a target-constrained bidirectional planning (TRIP) approach. The key idea is to plan the dialogue path by looking ahead (present-to-target) as well as looking back (target-to-present). This alleviates short-sightedness and drives better planning. 

Specifically, TRIP employs two Transformer decoders to generate the dialogue path bidirectionally as a sequence of <action, topic> pairs in the two directions. The forward and backward paths supervise each other by minimizing their decision gap. A contrastive mechanism enhances distinguishing between the target and non-targets. 

For decoding, a target-constrained beam search algorithm is proposed to achieve bidirectional agreement and generate the final path. The planned path then guides utterance generation via two methods: prompt-based generation and plan-controlled generation.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the task of target-oriented proactive dialogue generation and discusses its differences from existing work

- Proposes a novel target-constrained bidirectional planning (TRIP) approach to plan the dialogue path by simultaneously looking ahead and looking back

- Investigates both prompt-based and plan-controlled methods to leverage the planned paths to guide utterance generation 

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets with extensive experiments and analysis providing insights into planning for dialogue generation

The advantages are better explainability, controllability and practicality. Limitations are error propagation and robustness needs improvement. Future work includes incorporating TRIP with large language models.
