# [Text2MDT: Extracting Medical Decision Trees from Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance on many NLP tasks. However, their capabilities still fall behind fine-tuned models on more complex language understanding tasks that require reasoning.

- One promising approach is prompt-based learning, where natural language prompts are used to query LLMs to perform tasks without updating the model parameters. However, designing high-quality prompts requires expertise and remains labor-intensive. 

Method:
- The paper proposes PromptCBLUE, a Chinese biomedical language understanding evaluation benchmark with prompts and responses adapted for LLMs. 

- Tasks are reformulated to suit the few-shot learning style of prompting LLMs. This includes templating prompts to query for information step-by-step and structuring target responses to provide supervision.

- PromptCBLUE covers a diverse set of 10 biomedical NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, text classification/clustering, dialogue, etc.

Contributions:
- First Chinese biomedical language evaluation benchmark designed specifically for probing and enhancing LLMs' language understanding via prompting.

- Analysis of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs on biomedical language understanding through tests on PromptCBLUE tasks.

- PromptCBLUE serves as a testbed for developing prompting methods to improve language understanding of LLMs for practical biomedical NLP.

In summary, the paper presents PromptCBLUE, a novel Chinese benchmark to analyze biomedical language understanding of LLMs using prompt design, covering a wide range of language understanding tasks tailored for prompting pre-trained models. Experiments probe the reasoning capacities of LLMs on biomedical text and indicate directions for further enhancing language understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents PromptCBLUE, a prompt-based Chinese biomedical language understanding evaluation benchmark. The main contributions are:

1) PromptCBLUE reformulates 13 Chinese biomedical language understanding tasks into a unified prompt-based format to evaluate the language understanding abilities of large language models. 

2) It provides prompt templates and example prompts/targets for each task to enable prompt-based evaluation.

3) It analyzes the performance of several parameter-efficient tuning methods on PromptCBLUE benchmarks and shows their effectiveness.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of PromptCBLUE, a prompt-based benchmark for evaluating Chinese biomedical language understanding. The paper also provides an analysis of different tuning methods on the benchmark.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- PromptCBLUE - The proposed Chinese biomedical language understanding evaluation benchmark
- Biomedical language understanding - The focus application area, involving tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, etc. in the medical domain
- Prompt engineering - Methods like prompt tuning (P-tuning), prefix tuning v2 (P-tuning-V2), adapters, LoRA, AdaLoRA used to adapt pre-trained language models for downstream tasks 
- Task reformulation - How the authors reformulated existing biomedical tasks into a format more amenable for language models, like converting tasks into a QA style prompt-response format
- Entity-centric - Some tasks are entity-centric, like needing to generate responses containing certain entities 
- Chain-of-thought prompting - A strategy to decompose tasks and prompt language models to solve problems in a step-by-step manner
- Evaluation benchmark - Quantitative analysis of language model performance on the variety of biomedical language understanding tasks

The key focus is introducing and analyzing a benchmark for evaluating language models on biomedical language understanding tasks using prompt engineering techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes reformulating various Chinese medical tasks into a unified prompt-and-response format called PromptCBLUE. What were some key considerations and challenges in designing a unified format that could cover such a diverse set of tasks?

2. Chain-of-Thought prompting is proposed to improve the performance of named entity recognition tasks. How does explicitly asking the model to generate entities type-by-type lead to better performance compared to extracting all entities at once?

3. For the disease normalization task, candidate target terms are retrieved using BM25 before being ranked by the language model. Why was BM25 chosen for candidate retrieval over other methods like TF-IDF or semantic indexing techniques?

4. The paper evaluates various parameter-efficient tuning methods like adapters and LoRA for fine-tuning the language models. What are the tradeoffs of these methods compared to full fine-tuning? Why might they be preferred for certain use cases?

5. When reformulating the information retrieval task, only a single document is provided to determine relevance rather than full corpus search. What challenges does this introduce in properly evaluating information retrieval performance compared to the full task?

6. For the dialogue response generation task, entity-centric constraints were removed from the PromptCBLUE formulation. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of relaxing these constraints?

7. What types of biases or problematic behavior might arise from phrasing certain medical tasks as free text generation based on the prompt formats used in PromptCBLUE? How might the prompts be improved to mitigate these issues?

8. Could the PromptCBLUE framework be applied effectively to non-Chinese medical language tasks? What difficulties might arise in adapting it to other languages like English or Spanish? 

9. The error analysis suggests that longer dialogue context hinders performance for certain tasks. Why might increased dialogue length impair the language model's ability to generalize effectively?

10. In addition to the methods studied, what other promising techniques like retrieval-augmented generation could potentially be integrated with PromptCBLUE to further improve performance? What benefits might they provide?
