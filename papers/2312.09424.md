# [Open Domain Knowledge Extraction for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) need to be kept complete and fresh to power high-quality downstream applications. However, manual curation of facts is tedious and not scalable.  
- There are challenges around the volume of web data, variety of modalities, veracity of facts, and needing both streaming and batch updates.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ODKE, an automated knowledge extraction and ingestion framework to grow industrial-scale KGs.

Key Components:
- Extraction Initiator: Identifies missing or stale facts to extract.
- Evidence Retriever: Retrieves documents likely to contain evidence using search or crawling. 
- Knowledge Extractor: Includes pattern-based, model-based, and LLM-based extractors to extract facts.
- Corroborator: Normalizes and scores extractions to identify high-confidence facts.
- Ingestion: Adds extracted facts into the KG, creating entities if needed.
- Link Inference: Infers additional KG edges without extraction.
- Deployment: Supports both streaming and batch extraction pipelines.

Main Contributions:
- Automated framework to keep industrial KGs fresh at scale.
- Handles variety of modalities and tasks.
- Achieves high precision and throughput.  
- Bridges freshness gaps between data sources.
- Enables discovery of new trendy entities.
- Link inference further improves KG.
- Success deploying streaming and batch pipelines.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive automated knowledge extraction and ingestion framework that can efficiently ingest millions of high-quality facts to keep a real-world industrial KG complete and fresh.
