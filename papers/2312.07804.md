# [Uncertainty Visualization via Low-Dimensional Posterior Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In ill-posed inverse problems in imaging, there typically exists a range of plausible solutions for any given degraded input image. It is beneficial to provide the user with tools to efficiently explore and visualize this set of solutions along with their likelihoods, which represents the posterior distribution. However, directly modeling and visualizing the full posterior distribution is impractical for high-dimensional images. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new approach to estimate and visualize the posterior distribution by employing energy-based models (EBMs) to model the posterior projected onto low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically:

1. The method trains a conditional EBM that takes as input a degraded image, a point estimate of the image, and an affine subspace defined by a set of orthogonal basis vectors. 

2. The EBM outputs the probability density of the posterior distribution projected onto the provided subspace. By querying different points, one can visualize and explore the projected posterior distribution.

3. The subspace is selected to contain semantically meaningful directions that capture posterior uncertainties. Specifically, the point estimate is chosen as the minimum MSE estimate and the basis vectors are chosen as the top principal components (PCs) of the posterior.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new approach to uncertainty visualization via projected posterior distribution estimation that models posterior uncertainties in a low-dimensional space achievable with conditional EBMs.

- Demonstrates the approach on a range of image restoration tasks (denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, colorization) and datasets (MNIST, CelebA, ImageNet).

- Shows quantitative and qualitative improvements over baseline approaches in terms of better likelihood and more meaningful uncertainty visualizations.

- Establishes the benefit of directly modeling the projected posterior rather than naively slicing the high-dimensional posterior distribution.

Overall, the method enables efficient and semantically meaningful visualization of posterior uncertainties for high-dimensional image inverse problems.
