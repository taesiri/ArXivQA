# [Uncertainty Visualization via Low-Dimensional Posterior Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In ill-posed inverse problems in imaging, there typically exists a range of plausible solutions for any given degraded input image. It is beneficial to provide the user with tools to efficiently explore and visualize this set of solutions along with their likelihoods, which represents the posterior distribution. However, directly modeling and visualizing the full posterior distribution is impractical for high-dimensional images. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new approach to estimate and visualize the posterior distribution by employing energy-based models (EBMs) to model the posterior projected onto low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically:

1. The method trains a conditional EBM that takes as input a degraded image, a point estimate of the image, and an affine subspace defined by a set of orthogonal basis vectors. 

2. The EBM outputs the probability density of the posterior distribution projected onto the provided subspace. By querying different points, one can visualize and explore the projected posterior distribution.

3. The subspace is selected to contain semantically meaningful directions that capture posterior uncertainties. Specifically, the point estimate is chosen as the minimum MSE estimate and the basis vectors are chosen as the top principal components (PCs) of the posterior.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new approach to uncertainty visualization via projected posterior distribution estimation that models posterior uncertainties in a low-dimensional space achievable with conditional EBMs.

- Demonstrates the approach on a range of image restoration tasks (denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, colorization) and datasets (MNIST, CelebA, ImageNet).

- Shows quantitative and qualitative improvements over baseline approaches in terms of better likelihood and more meaningful uncertainty visualizations.

- Establishes the benefit of directly modeling the projected posterior rather than naively slicing the high-dimensional posterior distribution.

Overall, the method enables efficient and semantically meaningful visualization of posterior uncertainties for high-dimensional image inverse problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new method to visualize posterior uncertainty in ill-posed inverse problems by learning conditional energy-based models over low-dimensional subspaces adapted to the input measurement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a new method called "projected posterior distribution estimation" (PPDE) for estimating and visualizing posterior distributions in image restoration problems by employing energy-based models over low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically:

- They propose to train a conditional energy-based model (EBM) that receives an input measurement (e.g. a degraded image) and a set of directions spanning a low-dimensional subspace, and outputs the probability density function of the posterior distribution projected onto that subspace. 

- This allows them to visualize the posterior uncertainty in any low-dimensional space, such as the one spanned by the top principal components of the posterior. The EBM can output the projected posterior density for any queried point within the subspace.

- They demonstrate the effectiveness of PPDE for uncertainty visualization and quantification across several image restoration tasks and datasets. The method outperforms baselines that either assume a Gaussian posterior or rely on posterior sampling and kernel density estimation.

So in summary, the main contribution is a new framework (PPDE) for efficient and accurate estimation and visualization of posterior uncertainty in imaging inverse problems by using conditional EBMs over low-dimensional subspaces adapted to the input.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Posterior distribution - The paper focuses on visualizing and estimating the posterior distribution over solutions to ill-posed inverse problems given an input measurement. 

- Uncertainty visualization - The goal is to develop methods to effectively communicate and visualize the uncertainty in the solutions encoded in the posterior distribution.

- Energy-based models (EBMs) - The proposed method uses conditional EBMs to model the posterior distribution projected onto low-dimensional subspaces.

- Principal components (PCs) - The subspaces used for projection are often chosen to be spanned by the top principal components of the posterior.

- Projected posterior distribution (PPD) - This refers to the posterior distribution projected onto a lower dimensional subspace, which is more feasible to estimate and visualize compared to the full high-dimensional posterior.

- Input-adaptive subspaces - The choice of projection subspace is designed to be adapted to each input measurement to capture meaningful uncertainty directions. 

- Likelihood-informed visualization - By modeling the projected posterior distribution, the proposed method provides likelihood estimates to facilitate informed visualization and navigation of uncertainty.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes learning a conditional energy-based model (EBM) to model the projected posterior distribution (PPD). What are the advantages of using an EBM over alternative density estimation techniques like normalizing flows or autoregressive models? How does the EBM architecture and training procedure enable flexible modeling of complex posteriors?

2. Contrastive divergence (CD) is used to train the conditional EBM. What modifications were made to the standard CD algorithm to enable learning conditional distributions? How does the use of multilevel CD help improve training? 

3. The PPD visualizations seem to capture meaningful uncertainty directions even when the posterior slice misses high probability regions (Fig. 5). Intuitively explain why projecting the distribution onto a lower dimensional subspace is more informative than simply evaluating the density along the subspace.

4. How does the choice of the affine subspace impact the usefulness of the PPD visualization? What guided the decision to use the posterior mean and top PCs from NPPC as the origin and directions? Can you think of other potentially good choices? 

5. The paper demonstrates a significant NLL improvement over Gaussian approximations from NPPC and sample-based KDE estimates. What factors contribute to this improved density estimation capability? How do the qualitative results support the numbers?

6. Fig. 7 shows multimodal digit identity uncertainty in MNIST. Does the uncertainty seem well-calibrated - are the relative densities assigned to different digit modes reasonable? How can calibration be further improved?

7. For image colorization, the PPD reveals dataset biases (Fig. 8). What is a potential drawback of visualizing such biases without explicitly highlighting them? How can the interface be designed to avoid misleading users?

8. The method visualizes 2D projections of the posterior. What strategies can be adopted to effectively visualize key aspects of uncertainty in higher (3+) dimensions? What challenges might arise?

9. The runtime is compared to baseline methods that require costly sampling. However, the overall approach still seems computationally expensive. What are promising ways to reduce the computational requirements for practical use?

10. The method is demonstrated on multiple image processing tasks. What other application domains, beyond images, could benefit from such low-dimensional posterior uncertainty visualization? What adaptations would be required?
