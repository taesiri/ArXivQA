# [SinGRAF: Learning a 3D Generative Radiance Field for a Single Scene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17260)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we train a 3D-aware generative model to generate diverse and realistic variations of a single 3D scene, given only a small number of unposed 2D images of that scene as input?

The key hypothesis is that by using a continuous-scale patch discrimination approach during training, the model can learn to generate 3D scenes whose patch-based projections match the statistics of patches from the input images. This allows training the generative model from scarce unposed image data of a single scene.

In summary, the paper introduces SinGRAF, a novel 3D generative adversarial network, and shows how it can be trained to generate varied 3D radiance fields representing realistic layouts of a scene using only a few photographs of that scene as input. The core technique is the continuous-scale patch adversarial training process.
