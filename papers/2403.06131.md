# [FedPIT: Towards Privacy-preserving and Few-shot Federated Instruction   Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) enables collaborative training from multiple data owners without sharing private data. However, it faces two key challenges: 
  1) Lack of sufficient instruction data, leading to poor performance.
  2) Vulnerability to training data extraction attacks that can efficiently extract private training data.

Proposed Solution - FedPIT:
- Introduces two innovations to address the above challenges:
  1) Self-Generation: Leverages LLM's in-context learning ability to generate synthetic task-specific data to augment scarce local data.
  2) Parameter Isolation Training: Maintains separate global parameters (trained on synthetic data) and local parameters (trained on augmented local data).

Key Outcomes:
- FedPIT outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods for instruction tuning, demonstrating robustness against data heterogeneity.
- The synthetic data enhances federated few-shot performance while parameter isolation defends against data extraction attacks by ensuring attackers can only access synthetic data.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address data scarcity and privacy vulnerabilities in federated instruction tuning.
- Proposes innovative FedPIT algorithm incorporating self-generation and parameter isolation for enhanced utility and privacy.
- Extensive experiments on real-world medical data validate FedPIT's effectiveness over strong baselines.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling robust and privacy-preserving federated learning for instruction tuning LLMs under data-constrained settings.
