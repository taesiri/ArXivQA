## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper introduces GLM-130B, a new open-source bilingual language model with 130 billion parameters. Other recent work has also focused on open-sourcing large language models, such as OPT-175B, BLOOM-176B, and Jurassic-1. However, GLM-130B is one of the first models of this scale to be open-sourced and supports both English and Chinese.

This demonstrates continued innovation is needed in training techniques as models scale up.

- The paper demonstrates GLM-130B achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, outperforming GPT-3 and other models in some cases. This shows the architectural and training innovations can lead to higher performance compared to previous models.

- GLM-130B shows the ability to quantize to INT4 without significant performance loss. This enables more affordable inference than other models like GPT-3. Making large models accessible is an important contribution.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions around open-sourcing, training techniques, benchmark results, and inference accessibility. The level of technical detail on training a 100B+ model is a significant value add to the field.
