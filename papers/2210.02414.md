Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the main points in the paper:The paper introduces GLM-130B, an open and inclusive 130 billion parameter bilingual language model that outperforms similar models like GPT-3 and leverages training strategies and INT4 quantization to enable affordable inference on popular GPUs like RTX 3090.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper introduces GLM-130B, a new open-source bilingual language model with 130 billion parameters. Other recent work has also focused on open-sourcing large language models, such as OPT-175B, BLOOM-176B, and Jurassic-1. However, GLM-130B is one of the first models of this scale to be open-sourced and supports both English and Chinese.- The paper provides significant detail on the training strategies used for GLM-130B, including handling training stability issues and leveraging a 3D parallelism approach. Other recent papers have not gone into this level of depth on the engineering challenges of training 100B+ scale models. This helps advance the understanding of what it takes to train very large models.- The authors introduce a new technique called Embedding Gradient Shrink (EGS) to stabilize training. Other recent models like BLOOM-176B used embedding norm, but the authors show EGS works better for GLM-130B. This demonstrates continued innovation is needed in training techniques as models scale up.- The paper demonstrates GLM-130B achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, outperforming GPT-3 and other models in some cases. This shows the architectural and training innovations can lead to higher performance compared to previous models.- GLM-130B shows the ability to quantize to INT4 without significant performance loss. This enables more affordable inference than other models like GPT-3. Making large models accessible is an important contribution.Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions around open-sourcing, training techniques, benchmark results, and inference accessibility. The level of technical detail on training a 100B+ model is a significant value add to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving the stability and convergence of very large pre-trained language models. The authors note that training instability is one of the biggest challenges when scaling up to models with over 100 billion parameters. They suggest more research is needed into effective techniques to stabilize training at this scale.- Exploring different model architectures and objectives for large language models. The authors show that using a bidirectional GLM architecture and a multi-task training objective can improve performance over standard unidirectional GPT models. They suggest more exploration of model architectures and pre-training objectives is needed.- Developing more efficient inference and deployment methods. The authors demonstrate fast inference using INT4 quantization and optimized implementations. They suggest more work on model compression, efficient implementations, and lowering hardware requirements to increase accessibility.- Improving evaluation methods, especially for measuring model biases, fairness, and ethical behavior. The authors evaluate their model on some bias and toxicity benchmarks but note limitations. They suggest more work is needed on better evaluation methods in these areas.- Training with more high-quality data from diverse sources. The authors note that model performance improves with more training, and that private high-quality datasets likely contribute to the strong performance of models like PaLM. They suggest using more diverse high-quality training data.- Analysis to better understand model behavior and properties. The authors perform analysis like studying training stability and weight distributions that provides insight into model properties. Further analysis to elucidate reasons behind model behaviors could guide improvements.In summary, the authors point to continuing work on training techniques, model architectures, efficiency, evaluation, data, and analysis to further advance large language models and address outstanding issues. Their experiences with GLM provide a starting point to make progress in these areas.

This allows affordable access to an SOTA 100B-scale model.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces GLM-130B, a bilingual pre-trained language model with 130 billion parameters. The main method used to train this large model is as follows:The authors adopt the General Language Model (GLM) architecture with autoregressive blank infilling as the pre-training objective.

The model is trained on English and Chinese corpora with both a self-supervised objective and multi-task instruction learning. For efficient inference, GLM-130B is quantized to INT4 precision without loss of performance and accelerated using a customized C++ implementation. The resulting model shows strong performance on language modeling, question answering, and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming similar-sized models like GPT-3. Overall, careful architecture design, training strategies, and inference optimizations enable the authors to successfully train and deploy an open high-quality 100B-scale bilingual language model.
