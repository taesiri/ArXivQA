# [SwinTextSpotter: Scene Text Spotting via Better Synergy between Text   Detection and Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing end-to-end scene text spotting methods have two main limitations: (1) The interaction between the text detection and recognition modules is not enough just by sharing a backbone network. The detector does not optimize the recognition loss and the recognizer does not utilize detection features. (2) Most methods rely on additional components like character segmentation maps or rectification modules to handle arbitrarily shaped text, increasing model complexity.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes SwinTextSpotter, a new end-to-end framework for scene text spotting. The main ideas are:

(1) Adopt a transformer-based detector to model relationships between text instances. This allows detecting texts of different sizes/aspect ratios.

(2) Propose Recognition Conversion (RC) to convert detection features into recognition domain. RC generates tight masks on text regions to filter noise in recognition. RC also backpropagates recognition loss to detector to enable joint optimization.  

(3) Use a simple attention-based recognizer without rectification modules by effectively suppressing noise via RC.

Main Contributions:

(1) First work to show transformer and set prediction are effective for end-to-end text spotting.

(2) Propose RC to tightly couple and enable better synergy between detection and recognition modules. Allows concise model without character supervision or extra modules.

(3) Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text datasets - Multi-oriented (ICDAR 2015, RoIC13), arbitrarily shaped (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500), and multilingual (ReCTS, VinText).

(4) More robust to extreme text rotations compared to prior arts like MaskTextSpotter. Qualitative results also show it can better handle difficult text instances.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes SwinTextSpotter, a Transformer-based end-to-end text spotting framework with a novel Recognition Conversion mechanism to explicitly guide text localization through recognition loss for better synergy between detection and recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

1. SwinTextSpotter groundbreakingly shows that Transformer and the set-prediction scheme are effective in end-to-end scene text spotting.

2. SwinTextSpotter adopts the Recognition Conversion to exploit the synergy of text detection and recognition.

3. SwinTextSpotter is a concise framework that does not require character-level annotation as well as specifically designed rectification module for recognizing arbitrarily-shaped text. 

4. SwinTextSpotter achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public scene text benchmarks.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing a new end-to-end scene text spotting framework called SwinTextSpotter, which uses Transformer and Recognition Conversion to better coordinate text detection and recognition, achieves simplified framework and state-of-the-art performance without needing character-level annotation or rectification modules.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Scene text spotting - The task of simultaneously detecting and recognizing text in natural images. This is the main focus of the paper.

- End-to-end - Referring to training the detection and recognition modules jointly in a unified architecture rather than separately.

- Synergy - Exploiting the interactions between text detection and recognition to improve performance.

- Query-based detector - Treating text detection as a set prediction problem and using a set of learned proposal boxes and features.

- Recognition Conversion (RC) - A proposed module to guide the recognition using detection features and joint optimization. 

- Dilated Swin Transformer - Their backbone network incorporating dilated convolutions into Swin Transformer.

- Two-level self-attention (TLSAM) - Using fine and coarse grained self-attention in the recognition module.

- Experiments on multiple scene text datasets - Including oriented, irregular/curved, and multi-lingual datasets to demonstrate effectiveness.

The key focus is on improving synergy between detection and recognition in an end-to-end framework for scene text spotting. The proposed Recognition Conversion module and experiments on multiple datasets are central to showing these improvements.
