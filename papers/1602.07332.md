# [Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense   Image Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07332)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the Visual Genome dataset, which aims to enable more complex image understanding tasks beyond basic object recognition. The key features of Visual Genome are: (1) Dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships in over 100K images, with an average of 21 objects, 18 attributes, and 18 pairwise relationships per image. (2) Over 2 million region descriptions corresponding to localized parts of images. (3) Canonicalization of concepts to WordNet synsets to reduce ambiguity. (4) Question-answer pairs to allow for visual question answering tasks. (5) Formal representation of images using scene graphs that link objects, attributes and relationships. The authors present analysis to demonstrate the scale, completeness and diversity of the Visual Genome dataset components. They also provide baseline experiments for attribute classification, relationship prediction, region captioning and visual question answering to showcase potential uses of the dataset to train and benchmark next-generation computer vision models. The long-term goal is to move from basic object recognition to deeper image understanding and reasoning. The comprehensiveness of the Visual Genome annotation aims to support the development of more intelligent computer vision systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The Visual Genome dataset densely annotates images with objects, attributes, relationships, region descriptions, and question-answer pairs to enable deeper understanding of images beyond basic object recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Visual Genome dataset. Specifically, the paper presents Visual Genome, which is a dataset consisting of over 100K images densely annotated with objects, attributes, relationships, region descriptions, question-answer pairs, and graphical representations connecting the visual concepts in each image. The goal of the dataset is to enable the modeling of relationships between objects to move from perceptual to cognitive understanding of images, in order to tackle tasks like image description and question answering. The paper analyzes the dataset statistics, components, and canonicalization in detail, and presents some baseline experiments on tasks like attribute classification, relationship prediction, region description generation, and visual question answering. Overall, Visual Genome is presented as a benchmark dataset to train and evaluate next-generation computer vision models for comprehensive scene understanding.
