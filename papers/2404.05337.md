# [Towards Objectively Benchmarking Social Intelligence for Language Agents   at Action Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating social intelligence of language models predominantly operate at the language level through posed questions. This is inadequate as models may claim to perform actions without actually committing to them. 
- Many evaluations also rely on subjective metrics, diminishing reliability.
- There is a need for a benchmark that can evaluate language agents objectively at the action level by scrutinizing goal achievements within simulations.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the Social Tasks in Sandbox Simulation (STSS) benchmark to assess language agents by engaging them in social tasks within a multi-agent sandbox simulation environment.
- Design 30 templates of social tasks across 5 categories with automatic evaluation metrics based on agent trajectories and goal achievement. 
- Build an accompanying language-level benchmark with 325 conversation scenarios sliced from simulations to serve as a preliminary evaluation.
- Implement a Target-Driven Planning (TDP) module to enhance generative agents on social tasks and study significance of agent architecture.

Main Contributions:
- STSS benchmark that can objectively evaluate language agents at the action level on social intelligence based on goal achievement in simulations.
- Complementary language-level benchmark with situational dialogues for economically affordable preliminary assessment.
- Demonstration that agent architecture significantly impacts performance on social tasks in addition to language model capabilities.
- Extensive experiments showing existing language agents still find social tasks in STSS challenging, and TDP module consistently improves performance.
