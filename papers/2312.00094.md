# [Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Diffusion models can generate high-quality images by performing iterative denoising steps during sampling. However, they suffer from slow sampling speed, typically requiring thousands of steps. Recently, fast ODE solvers have accelerated sampling to less than 20 steps by using numerical methods like higher-order approximations. However, these induce approximation errors that degrade sample quality when using extremely few steps (around 5). In contrast, distillation methods can generate high-quality samples in 1 step but have downsides like requiring extensive pre-training and lacking flexibility.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a fast single-step ODE solver called AMED-Solver that eliminates approximation errors by learning to predict the optimal intermediate time step in each sampling step. This is based on the key observation that sampling trajectories lie close to a 2D subspace, allowing the mean value theorem to hold approximately. AMED can also be used as a plugin to improve any existing fast ODE solver, called AMED-Plugin. Both require little overhead to train using distillation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes AMED-Solver, a fast single-step ODE solver for diffusion models that achieves state-of-the-art image sample quality using around 5 steps by eliminating approximation errors.
- Generalizes the idea as AMED-Plugin to further boost performance of any existing fast ODE solver with negligible overhead.  
- Reveals and leverages the geometric property that sampling trajectories lie close to a 2D subspace to enable learning the step direction.
- Achieves superior sample quality than previous methods on diverse datasets and model architectures using around 5 steps.
