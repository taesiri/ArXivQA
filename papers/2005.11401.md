# [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively combine parametric and non-parametric memory in neural models for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. 

Specifically, the paper proposes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models that combine a parametric seq2seq model with non-parametric retrieval over an external knowledge source. The key hypothesis is that this hybrid parametric/non-parametric approach will outperform models that rely purely on either implicit parametric knowledge or explicit non-parametric retrieval for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.

The authors evaluate RAG models on a range of tasks including open-domain QA, abstractive QA, question generation, and fact verification. Their central claim is that RAG models achieve new state-of-the-art results on many of these knowledge-intensive tasks compared to prior work, demonstrating the benefits of combining parametric and non-parametric knowledge in a single architecture.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively integrate parametric and non-parametric knowledge sources for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The central hypothesis is that a hybrid model like RAG that combines pretrained parametric and non-parametric memories will outperform reliance on either knowledge source alone. The paper aims to demonstrate these benefits across a range of knowledge-intensive tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the key points I gathered from the paper:

- The paper introduces retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, which combine large pre-trained language models with non-parametric memory in the form of text retrieval.

- RAG models use a pre-trained neural retriever to retrieve relevant documents given an input text. These retrieved documents are then used as additional context when a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model generates the output. 

- Two variants of RAG are proposed: RAG-Sequence uses the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, while RAG-Token can use different passages per generated token.

- RAG models are evaluated on a diverse set of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks including open-domain QA, abstractive QA, question generation, and fact verification.

- The models achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domain QA datasets, outperforming previous parametric-only and retrieval-based models.

- For text generation tasks, RAG is shown to generate more factual, specific, and diverse responses compared to parametric-only baselines.

- The non-parametric memory can also be replaced without retraining to update the model's knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating retrieval-augmented generation models that combine parametric and non-parametric memory to achieve strong performance across a range of knowledge-intensive language tasks. The combination of pre-trained components enables accessing knowledge without task-specific training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores retrieval-augmented generation models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks including open-domain question answering, abstractive question answering, fact verification, and Jeopardy question generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- It brings together hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory models, which have mostly been explored separately before. Prior work like REALM and ORQA introduced parametric-nonparametric models for extractive QA, while this explores it for text generation. 

- The paper shows a single model architecture with a retriever and generator can achieve strong performance across a variety of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Most prior work focused on using retrieval to improve single tasks in isolation.

- The parametric and non-parametric components are both pre-trained, rather than trained from scratch together. This is different from some prior hybrid memory models like memory networks or stack-augmented networks.

- For the retrieval component, they use a bi-encoder with dense embeddings rather than reliance on sparse keyword matching. This learns a more semantic notion of relevance.

- The paper emphasizes factual knowledge capabilities more strongly than related work on dialogue agents with retrieval components. It includes analysis and human evaluation of factuality.

- Compared to retrieve-and-edit style approaches, there is less emphasis on lightly editing retrieved passages, and more on aggregating content from multiple retrievals.

Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution in advancing hybrid parametric/non-parametric models for text generation tasks, showing they can be effectively pre-trained and fine-tuned for strong performance on knowledge-intensive NLP problems. The analysis provides insights into how the two memory systems interact.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Pre-training the retriever and generator components jointly end-to-end, rather than just fine-tuning a pre-trained model. They propose this could be done with a denoising objective similar to BART, or some other suitable pre-training objective.

- Further investigating how the parametric and non-parametric memories in RAG models interact, and how to best combine them. The paper shows they can work synergistically, but more research is needed on the interaction between the two memory types.

- Applying RAG to a wider variety of NLP tasks beyond those explored in the paper, to demonstrate the generality of the approach.

- Addressing the issue of "retrieval collapse" that was sometimes observed during training, where the retriever learns to ignore the input and retrieve the same documents regardless. The authors suggest this could be due to less need for factual knowledge in some tasks.

- Extending the RAG approach to related frameworks like retrieve-and-edit for machine translation or semantic parsing, which could represent promising future work.

- Adding capabilities for multi-hop reasoning, where multiple retrieved passages are combined to infer new facts not contained in any single passage.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring joint pre-training, better understanding memory interactions, applying RAG to more tasks, addressing retrieval collapse, extending to related architectures, and adding capabilities like multi-hop reasoning. The authors frame RAG as a general and promising approach worthy of further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, which combine large pre-trained language models with non-parametric memory in the form of dense vector retrieval. The authors build RAG models using a pre-trained seq2seq model (BART) as the parametric memory and a Wikipedia dense vector index accessed via a pre-trained retriever (DPR) as the non-parametric memory. They propose two versions - RAG-Sequence which uses the same retrieved passage across all tokens, and RAG-Token which can use different passages per token. The models are trained end-to-end on a range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks like open-domain QA, question generation, and fact verification. The RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domain QA datasets, outperforming both parametric-only and retrieval-based models. For generation tasks like MS-MARCO, Jeopardy question generation, and FEVER fact verification, RAG models produce more factual, specific, and diverse responses compared to a BART baseline. A key advantage of RAG is the non-parametric memory can be replaced without retraining to update the model's knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores retrieval-augmented generation models (RAG) which combine large pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memories for performing well on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The parametric memory is a seq2seq model like BART, while the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia passages accessed via a retriever. The retriever provides relevant passages for the input, which the seq2seq model conditions on to generate the output. They compare two variants - one using the same retrieved passage across all tokens, and one which can use different passages per token.

The authors experiment on open-domain QA, abstractive QA, question generation, and fact verification tasks. The RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domain QA datasets, outperforming both parametric-only seq2seq models like T5 and task-specific retrieve-and-extract models like REALM. For generation tasks, RAG produces more factual, specific and diverse responses compared to BART baselines based on human evaluation. The non-parametric memory can also be easily swapped to update the model's knowledge without retraining. Overall, the results demonstrate the benefits of combining parametric and non-parametric memories with generation models for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation tasks. The parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model like BART, while the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia passages accessed using a pre-trained neural retriever. The retriever provides relevant Wikipedia passages for an input text which are fed along with the input to the seq2seq model to generate the output. Two variants are explored: RAG-Sequence uses the same retrieved passage across the whole output sequence, while RAG-Token can use different passages per output token. The models are trained end-to-end, treating the retrieved passages as latent variables that are marginalized out during training. Experiments on question answering, question generation, and fact verification tasks show benefits over parametric-only baselines, with the RAG models generating more factual, specific, and diverse outputs. The non-parametric index can also be swapped out to easily update the model's knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the limitations of large pre-trained language models in precisely accessing and manipulating knowledge, as well as providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge. The key problems/questions it aims to address are:

- Pre-trained language models store a lot of factual knowledge in their parameters, but their ability to precisely access and manipulate this knowledge is limited. This leads to poorer performance on knowledge-intensive tasks compared to task-specific architectures. 

- Providing provenance/explanations for decisions made by pre-trained models and updating their world knowledge as things change are open research problems.

- Prior work on combining pre-trained language models with non-parametric memory has focused on extractive question answering tasks. How to bring these hybrid parametric/non-parametric models to more general sequence generation tasks is an open question.

In summary, the key problem is how to augment pre-trained language models with non-parametric memory in a general way to improve their ability to precisely manipulate knowledge for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, while also addressing issues of provenance and updating world knowledge. The paper explores bringing such hybrid models to broader sequence generation tasks beyond just extractive QA.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to combine parametric and non-parametric memory for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Specifically, RAG combines a dense vector index of Wikipedia passages as a non-parametric memory with a pre-trained BART model as a parametric memory. A pre-trained neural retriever is used to retrieve relevant passages from the index given an input text, and these passages are provided as additional context to the BART model to generate an output. Two variants of RAG are explored: RAG-Sequence uses the same retrieved passages across the whole output sequence while RAG-Token can retrieve different passages per output token. 

RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on several knowledge-intensive QA datasets like Natural Questions and WebQuestions, outperforming previous extractive QA methods. For generative tasks like MS-MARCO question answering and Jeopardy question generation, RAG produces more factual, specific and diverse responses compared to BART. The non-parametric memory can also be hot-swapped to update the model's knowledge. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of combining parametric and non-parametric memory for a variety of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks where access to external knowledge is important.
