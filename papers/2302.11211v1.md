# [Distributionally Robust Recourse Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11211v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is to develop a method to generate robust counterfactual explanations for machine learning models. Specifically, the paper aims to address the issue that existing counterfactual explanation methods often assume the underlying ML model does not change over time. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice due to factors like data distribution shifts. To address this limitation, the paper proposes a new framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) to generate counterfactual explanations that are robust to distribution shifts in the model parameters. 

The key hypothesis is that by modeling the distribution of future model parameters as a mixture model and using ideas from distributionally robust optimization, they can generate counterfactual explanations that have a high probability of remaining valid even when the model parameters change due to data shifts. The DiRRAc framework formulates the counterfactual search problem as a min-max optimization that tries to minimize the worst-case probability of the counterfactual being invalid over an ambiguity set of plausible mixture model distributions for the future parameters.

In summary, the main research question is how to create counterfactual explanations that are robust to model parameter changes over time. The proposed hypothesis is that modeling parameter uncertainty using distributionally robust optimization techniques can produce more robust counterfactuals. The DiRRAc framework operationalizes this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) to generate recourse actions that are robust to shifts in the machine learning model's parameters. 

2. It formulates the robust recourse generation problem as a min-max optimization, where the inner maximization considers a distributional ambiguity set defined using the Gelbrich distance. This allows reformulating the infinite-dimensional problem into an equivalent finite-dimensional one.

3. It provides a projected gradient descent algorithm along with convergence guarantees to efficiently solve the reformulated min-max problem and find a robust recourse action. 

4. It extends the DiRRAc framework to handle mixture weight uncertainty and minimize the worst-case component probability of unfavorable outcome. It also proposes a Gaussian DiRRAc variant by modeling the component distributions as Gaussians.

5. It demonstrates through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that the proposed DiRRAc framework generates recourses that are more robust to distribution shifts compared to several baselines, while maintaining reasonable recourse costs.

In summary, the key novelty of this work lies in formulating the robust recourse problem under distributional ambiguity sets and providing an efficient computational approach via reformulation and optimization algorithms. The proposed DiRRAc framework helps generate recourses that have higher validity under model shifts.
