# [BSNet: Box-Supervised Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher for 3D Instance   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
3D instance segmentation typically requires tedious point-level annotations. Using 3D bounding boxes as annotations is more efficient but introduces ambiguity in instance labels, especially in overlapping regions between boxes. Current methods either focus on local structure modeling or global relationship modeling, but lack a unified framework to leverage both effectively. 

Proposed Solution - BSNet:
1) A novel pseudo-labeler called Simulation-assisted Transformer (SAFormer) that incorporates simulated samples and mean teacher paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. 

2) Simulated samples are constructed from non-overlapping boxes to provide prior knowledge about overlapping areas. This allows initializing the teacher and student networks instead of training from scratch.

3) A Local-Global Aware Attention decoder that models both local structures of instances and global relationships between instances/regions. This allows precisely distinguishing between instances in overlapping areas.

4) Pseudo-labels from SAFormer supervise a 3D instance segmentation network. Soft supervision loss is designed to account for confidence in pseudo-labels.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to incorporate simulated samples and mean teacher for pseudo-label generation in weak supervision. Enables high quality pseudo-labels.
- Novel decoder modeling both local and global context for precise instance segmentation.
- State-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and S3DIS datasets. Achieves 95-99% of fully supervised methods with only box annotations.
- Analysis of various components shows local+global modeling, simulated samples and mean teacher are crucial for performance.
