# [Knowledge Boundary and Persona Dynamic Shape A Better Social Media Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing social media agents face two key challenges - they possess world knowledge that doesn't align with their personas, and they use all persona information when taking actions, causing interference. This reduces personalization and anthropomorphism. 

Solution:
This paper proposes an agent with personalized knowledge and dynamic persona information to address the above problems. 

For personalized knowledge, external knowledge sources are added and matched to the agent's persona. This gives agents knowledge consistent with their personas.  

For dynamic personas, the persona information is divided into retrievable items. When taking actions, relevant items are retrieved using the action as query. This reduces interference from irrelevant persona information.

Contributions:

1) The agent has personalized world knowledge and dynamic persona information for better personalization and anthropomorphism.

2) Five modules are designed for the agent - persona, action, planning, memory and reflection. This makes the agent suitable for social media. 

3) A social media simulation sandbox with authentic interfaces is built to provide an interaction and evaluation environment for the agent.  

Evaluations via automated metrics and human annotation demonstrate the agent's effectiveness - its actions are rational, its text generation is high quality and relevant to the persona.
