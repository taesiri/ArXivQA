# [Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at   Copying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Transformers have become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but they have quadratic memory and compute costs that scale with the sequence length. This has motivated developing "generalized state space models" (GSSMs) like Mamba that use a fixed-size latent state and have constant per-token costs. 

- However, it is unclear what capabilities might be sacrificed by GSSMs for the sake of efficiency. This paper studies the ability of models to access and copy information from variable-length context, which is important for many tasks.

Theoretical Analysis:
- The paper formally studies the copy task, where a model must output an exact copy of a variable-length input string. 

- They prove transformers can copy sequences of length exponential in model size by storing n-grams in attention heads as keys to lookup values for copying.

- In contrast, they prove GSSMs fundamentally cannot copy sequences longer than their fixed-size latent state.

Experiments:
- Empirically, transformers train much faster and generalize better to longer strings than GSSMs on synthetic copying tasks.

- Analysis shows transformers learn a similar n-gram lookup algorithm to the theoretical construction.

- Experiments on pretrained models show that even when GSSMs have lower perplexity as language models, transformers still substantially outperform them on memory-intensive contextual tasks like copying or question answering.

Main Contributions:
- Formal comparison of copying ability between transformers and GSSMs showing fundamental limitations of fixed-size memory models.

- Concrete mechanism (n-gram hashing) for how transformers can store context, proved theoretically and verified experimentally.  

- Demonstration across model sizes that architectural choice impacts ability to leverage context above and beyond perplexity.

In summary, the paper identifies and proves a limitation of GSSMs in accessing variable-length context, and shows transformer models consistently outperform GSSMs on contextual tasks despite efficiency advantages of state space models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper shows that transformer models can copy exponentially long input sequences while state space models are fundamentally limited to copying sequences only as long as their fixed-size latent state.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides both theoretical and empirical evidence that transformer models are better than state space models (GSSMs) at tasks requiring copying long strings from the input context.

Specifically, the main contributions are:

1) A theoretical construction showing that a small transformer can copy sequences of length exponential in its size, while proving a lower bound that GSSMs cannot copy sequences longer than their latent state size.

2) Experiments on synthetic data showing transformers learn to copy much faster, generalize better to longer sequences, and appear to implement a form of n-gram hashing similar to the theoretical construction.

3) Experiments on pretrained models demonstrating that transformers substantially outperform GSSMs of similar parameter count at tasks requiring copying or retrieving information from context.

Overall, the paper demonstrates a fundamental limitation of GSSMs compared to transformers in terms of their ability to access and repeat long sequences from the input context. It provides both theory and experiments highlighting this architectural difference on tasks of practical relevance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Transformers - The dominant neural network architecture for sequence modeling. The paper compares transformers to state space models.

- State space models - Models like RNNs and other architectures that use a fixed-size latent state to process sequences. Also referred to as "generalized state space models" (GSSMs).

- Copying task - A sequence-to-sequence task where the model must copy the input sequence. Used theoretically and experimentally to compare transformers and GSSMs.

- Representation capacity - Theoretical expressivity in terms of what functions can be represented by different model classes. Analyzed for transformers and GSSMs. 

- Length generalization - Evaluating models on longer sequence lengths than seen during training, to test if the learned solution generalizes.

- Positional encodings - Embeddings that provide position information to transformer models, like relative position encodings.

- Pretrained models - Experiments on large publicly available pretrained language models to evaluate real-world performance on memory tasks.

- Information retrieval - Tasks requiring selectively copying small pieces of context, evaluated on models like question answering.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that transformers are better at copying long sequences compared to generalized state space models (GSSMs). Can you expand more on why the fixed-size latent state is fundamentally limited in its ability to copy long sequences? What modifications could be made to GSSMs to improve their copying capability?

2. The paper introduces a "Hard-ALiBi" positional encoding that seems crucial for the transformer's ability to copy long sequences. Can you explain in more detail how this positional encoding works and why it is more suitable for copying compared to other positional encodings? 

3. The hash-based copying algorithm outlined for the transformer relies on retrieving previous n-grams to know where to copy from. How exactly does the transformer leverage attention and positional encodings to implement this lookup functionality?

4. Could the superior copying capability of transformers over GSSMs stem from differences during pre-training rather than fundamental architectural differences? How could we design pre-training objectives better suited for GSSMs on copying tasks?

5. The paper shows the transformer continues to outperform GSSMs when evaluated on real natural language tasks like question answering. Why do you think the ability to copy/retrieve from context transfers to better performance on downstream tasks?

6. The theory proves the transformer can copy sequences exponential in the number of heads, but the experiments only show superior copying up to length 1000. Why is there a gap between theory and practice here? How could we modify the experiments to better align with theory?

7. What other probing tasks beyond copying could better elucidate differences in capabilities between transformers and GSSMs? What aspects could these tasks focus on?

8. The paper hints at hybrid architectures to get the best of both worlds. What challenges do you foresee in developing a model that combines aspects of transformers and GSSMs? Where would you start?

9. The theory makes certain simplifying assumptions like error-free operations. How robust are the theoretical results to more realistic assumptions about precision, noise, etc?

10. The paper studies auto-regressive copying, but could conclusions change for non auto-regressive generation? Why might non-auto-regressive decoding better leverage a fixed-size state?
