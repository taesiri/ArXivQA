# [Sora Generates Videos with Stunning Geometrical Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently developed video generation models like Sora can produce visually stunning videos. However, there is a lack of metrics to quantitatively evaluate if the generated videos conform to real-world physics, especially in terms of geometry.  

- Traditional video generation metrics like FID, FVD, IS and Aesthetic Score cannot assess the physical accuracy and geometric consistency of generated videos.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using 3D reconstruction quality from the generated videos as a proxy metric to evaluate their geometric consistency and adherence to real-world physics. 

- The rationale is that accuracy of 3D reconstruction relies heavily on the video quality and geometric coherence across frames.

- Metrics are designed to assess number of matched points between frame pairs, number of inlier matches after filtering, inlier ratio, reprojection error statistics etc. These indicate how well the videos conform to two-view geometry constraints.

- Experiments reconstruct 3D models from videos generated by Sora, Pika and Gen2 using the same text prompts. Both quantitative metrics and visualizations demonstrate significantly superior reconstruction quality for Sora videos.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes novel benchmark to quantitatively evaluate geometry consistency and physics plausibility of generated videos using 3D reconstruction quality.

- Designs a set of metrics like number of matches, inlier ratios, reprojection errors etc. to measure adherence to two-view geometry constraints.

- Experiments demonstrate clear advantages of videos generated by Sora model compared to Pika and Gen2 in terms of geometric fidelity and stability based on 3D reconstruction analysis.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage 3D reconstruction quality from generated videos as a proxy for quantitatively gauging their conformance to real-world geometric principles. Both numeric metrics and visualization results presented strongly highlight the capabilities of Sora model.
