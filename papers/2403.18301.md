# [Selective Mixup Fine-Tuning for Optimizing Non-Decomposable Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Practical performance metrics like worst-case recall and constraints like fairness are important for real-world deployment of models. However, optimizing such non-decomposable objectives is challenging.
- Existing empirical methods optimize mean recall well but perform poorly on other metrics. Theoretical methods can optimize desired metrics but require expensive retraining of models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes SelMix, a selective mixup-based fine-tuning approach to optimize for non-decomposable objectives on a pre-trained model. 
- SelMix determines a sampling distribution to perform mixups of features between particular classes such that it improves the desired metric.  
- It calculates tractable approximations of metric gains for each class mixup and samples mixups from a scaled softmax of these gains.

Key Contributions:
- Evaluated SotA empirical and theoretical methods on non-decomposable metrics showing their limitations.
- Proposed SelMix that utilizes mixups to optimize desired metric through an adaptive sampling distribution and demonstrated its effectiveness.
- Showed SelMix scales to large datasets like ImageNet while being inexpensive as a fine-tuning approach.
- Demonstrated optimization capability for non-linear metrics and outperformance in case of mismatched unlabeled distributions.
- Showed easy integration of SelMix with other mixup variants and its applicability in supervised learning.

In summary, the paper develops SelMix as an inexpensive fine-tuning technique to optimize complex non-decomposable performance metrics on pretrained models, outperforming existing empirical and theoretical methods.
