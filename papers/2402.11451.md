# [SciAgent: Tool-augmented Language Models for Scientific Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Scientific reasoning poses a major challenge even for advanced large language models (LLMs). To solve complex scientific problems, both mathematical and domain-specific reasoning abilities are required. However, annotating scientific reasoning data across diverse domains is very expensive and training LLMs for each domain separately is impractical. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a new "tool-augmented" setting to enhance LLMs' scientific reasoning skills. Instead of aiming for an omniscient problem solver, the focus shifts to developing a proficient "tool user" that can leverage domain-specific toolsets (functions). This approach tackles domain reasoning challenges by teaching LLMs to properly use reusable, scalable toolkits.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces the first tool-augmented training corpus \corpus{} with 31k math-related samples that teach essential math skills and tool usage.
- Develops SciAgent, a series of tool-augmented agents fine-tuned on \corpus{} that can retrieve, understand and use tools for reasoning.  
- Constructs SciToolBench, a benchmark with 856 questions over 5 scientific domains along with domain-specific toolsets (2446 functions).
- Experiments show SciAgent variants substantially outperform comparable LLMs. SciAgent-DeepMath-7B notably exceeds ChatGPT and competes with GPT-4 without tools.
- Analysis offers insights into the benefits and limitations of tool-augmented agents.

In summary, this paper pioneers the tool-augmented setting to enhance and evaluate LLMs' scientific reasoning abilities. The introduced training corpus, models and benchmark facilitate research towards developing proficient tool users that can leverage external functions to solve complex scientific problems.
