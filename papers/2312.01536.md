# [CalliPaint: Chinese Calligraphy Inpainting with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Chinese calligraphy inpainting methods, which can be useful for art and education, remain relatively unexplored despite recent advances in Chinese calligraphy generation and image inpainting. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new framework called "CalliPaint" that utilizes a Chinese calligraphy generation model (Calliffusion) and an image inpainting technique (RePaint) to perform Chinese calligraphy inpainting conditioned on text. 

During training, the Calliffusion model is trained to generate Chinese calligraphy images based on text conditions specifying characters, scripts, and styles. For inpainting, the pretrained Calliffusion model is combined with the RePaint image inpainting technique that allows inpainting without additional training. 

In the inference phase, an image with masks is provided along with text conditions. The model inpaints the masked regions with new calligraphy content matching the surrounding unmasked content and fulfilling the text conditions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first framework for conditional Chinese calligraphy inpainting using diffusion models
- Achieves convincing inpainting results as evaluated both objectively and in user studies
- Framework can enable novel applications in art and calligraphy education
- Analyzes model behavior and limitations around flaws and non-existing characters

The proposed CalliPaint represents an advance for applying diffusion models to the unique and culturally significant art of Chinese calligraphy inpainting. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate its ability to produce realistic inpaintings.
