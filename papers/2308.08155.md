# AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation   Framework

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not seem to explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. However, here is what I understand to be the main focus and goals of the paper:The paper introduces a new framework called AutoGen that enables development of complex LLM applications using multi-agent conversations. The key ideas are:- AutoGen allows creating customizable and conversable agents that can leverage strengths of LLMs, tools, and humans. - It provides a simple way to define workflows as automated conversations between agents. This simplifies implementing complex LLM applications.- It supports flexible conversation patterns like fully autonomous chats, human-in-the-loop conversations, static and dynamic conversations, etc.- The applications built using AutoGen showcase how it enables creating complex workflows easily as multi-agent conversations.So in summary, the main goals and focus of the paper seem to be:1) Introducing the AutoGen framework that simplifies building complex LLM apps via multi-agent conversations2) Demonstrating the flexibility of AutoGen in implementing diverse conversation patterns and applications3) Showcasing how AutoGen enables creating complex workflows easily as automated agent chatsThe paper does not seem to be driven by a specific central research question or hypothesis. Rather, it introduces and evaluates the AutoGen framework through applications. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or explain anything further!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be presenting \libName, a new framework that enables the development of large language model (LLM) applications using multiple conversational agents. Some key aspects of the \libName framework:- It allows creating customizable and conversable agents that can leverage LLMs, humans, and tools. For example, an agent can be powered by GPT-4, allow human input, and execute code.- The agents have unified conversation interfaces, allowing them to interact and collaborate through back-and-forth messaging. This allows complex workflows to be represented as automated agent conversations.- \libName supports flexible agent conversation patterns like fully autonomous chats, human-in-the-loop conversations, static and dynamic topologies. This allows it to handle applications of varying complexity.- The paper demonstrates \libName through 6 diverse applications: math problem solving, supply chain optimization, web task automation, retrieval-based QA, group chats, and conversational chess. So in summary, the main contribution is presenting \libName as a new framework that uses the idea of multi-agent conversations to enable and simplify the development of complex LLM applications. The key innovations are the conversable and customizable agent design, and the support for diverse conversation patterns.
