# [SemEval Task 1: Semantic Textual Relatedness for African and Asian   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Past semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks focused only on equivalence/paraphrase relations between texts, missing other dimensions of semantic relatedness. 
- There is a lack of semantic textual relatedness (STR) resources and tasks, especially for low-resource languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the first SemEval shared task on STR to investigate semantic relatedness across 14 languages from 5 families, mostly lower-resourced ones spoken in Africa/Asia.

- Provide participants with SemRel, a collection of newly curated STR datasets for the 14 languages. Sentence pairs have relatedness scores between 0 (unrelated) and 1 (closely related).

- Host a competition with 3 tracks: (a) supervised (b) unsupervised (c) cross-lingual STR prediction. Systems are ranked by how well their predicted rankings correlate with human judgments.

Contributions:
- Release SemRel, the first extensive STR benchmarks for 14 languages to enable future STR research.

- Report on systems from 163 participants, with 70 final submissions and 38 system description papers. Provide analysis of most effective approaches for supervised, unsupervised, cross-lingual STR.

- Find supervised models can effectively leverage labeled data but perform differently across languages. Unsupervised methods using character n-grams can also work well.

- Show determining STR is non-trivial, with model performance not simply correlating with resource availability of a language. More research needed into language-specific techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces new STR datasets and an evaluation task which draws wide participation. It provides the first extensive study into STR approaches for multiple languages, analyzes system effectiveness, and identifies directions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the first shared task on semantic textual relatedness across 14 languages from 5 families, with 163 participants submitting systems across 3 tracks (supervised, unsupervised, cross-lingual) in 70 final submissions from 51 teams.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Presenting the first shared task on Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) across 14 languages: Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Punjabi, Spanish, and Telugu. These datasets cover five distinct language families spoken primarily in Africa and Asia. The task focuses on determining the degree of semantic relatedness between sentences, a broader phenomenon than semantic textual similarity. Participants competed in three tracks: supervised, unsupervised, and cross-lingual. The shared task attracted 163 participants and 70 final submissions from 51 teams. The paper summarizes the results, best-performing methods, and most effective and promising approaches. Overall, the findings show that determining semantic textual relatedness is non-trivial and performance varies greatly across languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Semantic textual relatedness (STR)
- Semantic similarity
- Best-Worst Scaling (BWS)
- Low-resource languages
- Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Punjabi, Spanish, Telugu
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning  
- Cross-lingual learning
- Spearman rank correlation
- Sentence embeddings 
- BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R (transformer models)
- Data augmentation
- Adapter tuning
- Ensemble methods

The paper presents the first shared task on semantic textual relatedness across 14 languages, with a focus on African and Asian languages. It includes supervised, unsupervised and cross-lingual tracks. Performance was evaluated using Spearman correlation. Many teams utilized transformer models like BERT and data augmentation or adapter tuning. So these are some of the key terms associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) for annotation. What are the advantages of using BWS over traditional rating scales for annotation? How does it help mitigate annotation biases?

2. The paper augmented training data using machine translation. What considerations should be kept in mind while using machine translation for data augmentation to avoid introducing biases? 

3. Adapter-based tuning and task-adaptive pre-training (TAPT) were used for fine-tuning models. How do these methods help improve model performance compared to regular fine-tuning? What are their limitations?

4. Several teams used ensembling of models in their systems. What are some good practices for creating ensembles that improve performance over individual models? What kind of diversity should the models have?

5. How suitable are character and word n-gram features for the unsupervised track where semantic annotations were not allowed? What modifications need to be made to use pre-trained language models in this setting?

6. Whitening was used to transform non-uniform similarity score distributions into uniform ones. How does this process work? When should it be applied and what can go wrong? 

7. What language features can be beneficial for cross-lingual transfer? Should typological similarity guide the choice of languages for transfer learning?

8. How reasonable is the assumption that English training data translated to other languages can work for cross-lingual systems? What data biases can get introduced through translation?

9. The paper reports variance in performance across languages. What factors contribute to this variance for low-resource languages? How can it be mitigated?

10. What ethical concerns arise from perceiveing annotator judgments as ground truth? How can the subjectiveness of semantic relatedness annotations be reconciled with in NLP systems?
