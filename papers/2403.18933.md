# [SemEval Task 1: Semantic Textual Relatedness for African and Asian   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Past semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks focused only on equivalence/paraphrase relations between texts, missing other dimensions of semantic relatedness. 
- There is a lack of semantic textual relatedness (STR) resources and tasks, especially for low-resource languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the first SemEval shared task on STR to investigate semantic relatedness across 14 languages from 5 families, mostly lower-resourced ones spoken in Africa/Asia.

- Provide participants with SemRel, a collection of newly curated STR datasets for the 14 languages. Sentence pairs have relatedness scores between 0 (unrelated) and 1 (closely related).

- Host a competition with 3 tracks: (a) supervised (b) unsupervised (c) cross-lingual STR prediction. Systems are ranked by how well their predicted rankings correlate with human judgments.

Contributions:
- Release SemRel, the first extensive STR benchmarks for 14 languages to enable future STR research.

- Report on systems from 163 participants, with 70 final submissions and 38 system description papers. Provide analysis of most effective approaches for supervised, unsupervised, cross-lingual STR.

- Find supervised models can effectively leverage labeled data but perform differently across languages. Unsupervised methods using character n-grams can also work well.

- Show determining STR is non-trivial, with model performance not simply correlating with resource availability of a language. More research needed into language-specific techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces new STR datasets and an evaluation task which draws wide participation. It provides the first extensive study into STR approaches for multiple languages, analyzes system effectiveness, and identifies directions for future work.
