# [ActiveDP: Bridging Active Learning and Data Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06056)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ActiveDP: Bridging Active Learning and Data Programming":

Problem: 
Modern machine learning models require large labeled datasets to achieve good performance. However, manually labeling large datasets is expensive and time-consuming. Two paradigms aim to tackle this problem - data programming and active learning - but both have limitations. Data programming can rapidly label large datasets by using label functions (LFs) provided by users, but generates noisy labels which hurt model performance. Active learning acquires clean labels but only for a small fraction of data.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ActiveDP, a novel framework that combines active learning and data programming to generate high-quality labels with both accuracy and coverage. The key ideas are:

1) Interactive LF creation: ActiveDP actively selects instances for users to inspect and design LFs. The designed LFs are used to train a label model (in data programming) and also create a pseudo-labeled dataset to train an active learning model.

2) Label aggregation: At inference time, ActiveDP aggregates the predictions of the label model and active learning model using a confidence-based method called ConFusion. This balances label quality and coverage.

3) Helpful LF selection: ActiveDP selects a subset of helpful LFs using a method called LabelPick to eliminate noisy LFs.

4) Sample selection strategy: A new sampling method called ADP is proposed to select queried instances by considering uncertainty of both the active learning and label models.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes ActiveDP, a novel framework to combine active learning and data programming paradigms 
- Designs various strategies to improve efficiency and label quality of ActiveDP: ConFusion label aggregation, ADP sampling strategy, LabelPick LF selection
- Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets
- Achieves good performance under different labeling budgets and is robust to label noise

In summary, ActiveDP advances state-of-the-art by combining strengths of active learning and data programming to rapidly generate high-quality labels for training machine learning models. The proposed techniques also help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the framework.
