# [UniEdit: A Unified Tuning-Free Framework for Video Motion and Appearance   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advances have enabled impressive text-guided video appearance editing, such as stylization. However, editing the motion of a video (e.g. changing actions like eating to waving) is still underexplored. Doing so while preserving non-edited content is challenging. Prior tuning-based methods compromise content quality or diversity. A unified tuning-free framework for editing both appearance and motion is lacking.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes UniEdit, a tuning-free framework to edit both video appearance and motion using text prompts. It follows an inversion-then-generation pipeline using a pre-trained text-to-video model. To enable motion editing, auxiliary branches are introduced - a motion reference branch generates features guided by the target text prompt, while a reconstruction branch preserves source content features. These features are injected into the main branch via temporal and spatial attention layers respectively. For appearance editing, spatial attention features from the reconstruction branch are used to retain structure. Overall this allows editing of either motion or appearance in a unified architecture while preserving non-edited content.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first tuning-free framework UniEdit to achieve both video motion and appearance editing under text guidance in a unified architecture.
- Introduces motion reference and reconstruction branches along with injection methods to enable text-guided motion editing while preserving content.  
- Achieves appearance editing tasks like stylization and object replacement while retaining spatial structure consistency.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on diverse editing tasks qualitatively and quantitatively.

In summary, UniEdit advances the field of video editing by supporting both motion and appearance editing without compromising content quality or diversity, outperforming prior arts across diverse tasks. The unified architecture is generalizable and impactful for creative workflows.
