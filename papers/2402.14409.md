# [Tug-of-War Between Knowledge: Exploring and Resolving Knowledge   Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14409)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) integrate internal memory with external evidence from sources like Wikipedia to mitigate hallucination risks. However, knowledge conflicts frequently arise between the model's internal memory and external sources or among the external sources themselves. These conflicts can limit the practical applicability of RALMs.

Methodology: 
- The authors present an evaluation framework to assess knowledge conflicts in RALMs across dimensions like open-domain, entity popularity, and multi-hop reasoning. Experiments are conducted with 8 models on 4 QA datasets.

- Model behavior is analyzed from 3 perspectives - correctness, faithfulness to evidence, and reliance on internal memory. Two key conflict scenarios are studied:

1) Between internal memory and external sources:
- More capable models gain confidence in their internal memory, exhibiting the Dunning-Kruger effect by stubbornly trusting incorrect internal memory even with correct external evidence.
- Models display availability bias, preferring commonly known knowledge in internal memory over external sources for long-tail knowledge.

2) Among truthful, irrelevant and misleading evidence:  
- Models struggle to discern truthful from misleading evidence, following majority rule by trusting more frequent evidence.
- Models display confirmation bias by preferring evidence that aligns with their internal memory.
- Performance declines as the number of conflicting evidence hops increases.

Proposed Solution - Conflict-Disentangle Contrastive Decoding (CD2):
- Contrastive decoding is applied to amplify differences between expert and amateur logits. This helps resolve conflicts between internal memory and external sources.
- Fact-aware instruction tuning makes the model aware of truthful/misleading evidence. Expert and amateur LMs generate truthful/misleading answers respectively. Contrastive decoding maximizes the difference in their logits to identify truthful evidence.

Results:
- Without parameter updates, CD2 improves performance over in-context learning by 2-3% recall on conflicting QA datasets. It also substantially reduces reliance on misleading evidence.

Contributions:
- Thorough investigation and analysis of knowledge conflict behaviors in RALMs
- Effective CD2 method to resolve knowledge conflicts and improve performance


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces an evaluation framework for investigating knowledge conflicts in retrieval-augmented language models, reveals the behavior and preferences of models under conflicts between internal and external knowledge as well as among external evidence, and proposes a confidence calibration method to resolve the conflicts effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces an evaluation framework that conducts a thorough investigation into knowledge conflicts in retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). Experiments are conducted with eight models on four QA datasets, evaluating them from three dimensions: correctness, faithfulness and memorization.

2. It investigates the behavior and preference of RALMs in the tug-of-war between knowledge. It finds that powerful RALMs emerge with the Dunning-Kruger effect when internal memory and external sources conflict. Moreover, RALMs follow the principle of majority rule and exhibit confirmation bias when facing truthful, irrelevant and misleading evidence. 

3. It proposes a novel method called Conflict-Disentangle Contrastive Decoding (CD2) to better calibrate the model's confidence and resolve knowledge conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that CD2 can effectively resolve knowledge conflicts in RALMs, with an average recall improvement of 2.35% and 2.41% on two datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs)
- Knowledge conflicts
- Internal memory 
- External sources
- Parametric knowledge
- Non-parametric knowledge
- Hallucination
- Dunning-Kruger effect
- Availability bias  
- Confirmation bias
- Majority rule
- Contrastive decoding
- Fact-aware instruction tuning
- Expert and amateur language models

The paper explores knowledge conflicts in RALMs from two main perspectives: (1) conflicts between the model's internal memory and external sources, and (2) conflicts between truthful, irrelevant, and misleading evidence in the external sources. Key findings include the Dunning-Kruger effect, availability bias, confirmation bias, and majority rule exhibited by RALMs. The proposed method is Conflict-Disentangle Contrastive Decoding (CD^2) which aims to better calibrate the model's confidence to resolve knowledge conflicts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel method called Conflict-Disentangle Contrastive Decoding (CD2) to resolve knowledge conflicts in retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). Could you explain in more detail the intuition behind using contrastive decoding to maximize differences between various logits? 

2. How exactly does CD2 leverage fact-aware instruction tuning to make the RALM aware of truthful and misleading evidence? What are the specific steps taken to train the "expert" LM and "amateur" LM?

3. The paper mentions using CD2 to address conflicts between internal memory and external sources, as well as between truthful, irrelevant and misleading evidence. What are the specific formulations and procedures for applying CD2 in these two cases? 

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using contrastive decoding versus other methods like finetuning or prompt-based tuning to resolve knowledge conflicts in RALMs?

5. How robust is the performance of CD2 to different hyperparameters like the coefficients α and β? Was any sensitivity analysis conducted when selecting the default values? 

6. The paper focused on applying CD2 without updating model parameters. How would further finetuning or pretraining with CD2 as an auxiliary objective potentially improve performance?

7. What types of knowledge conflicts does CD2 fail to adequately resolve? What are limitations of the approach and areas for further improvement?  

8. How efficiently can CD2 scale to even larger retrieval-augmented LLMs? Are there any computational or memory bottlenecks to be aware of?

9. Could CD2 be extended to other modalities like vision-language models that may encounter similar knowledge conflicts between internal representations and external context? 

10. Beyond question answering, what other potential NLP applications could benefit from using CD2 to resolve knowledge conflicts, such as summarization, dialogue, etc.?
