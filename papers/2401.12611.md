# [Prompt Smells: An Omen for Undesirable Generative AI Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12611)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Generative AI (GenAI) models can sometimes produce extrinsic hallucinations - unrealistic or nonsensical outputs that are inconsistent with the provided context or training data. This poses challenges for expanding the use of GenAI to sensitive domains like software development or high-risk applications where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.  

Solution:
The paper introduces the concept of "prompt smells" - characteristics of a prompt that can lead to undesirable or inexplainable GenAI outputs. Prompt smells can arise from imprecise prompt engineering, such as ambiguous, convoluted or incoherent prompts. 

The paper proposes that identifying and mitigating prompt smells can improve the quality, explainability and reliability of GenAI outputs. This is analogous to identifying and refactoring "code smells" in software development.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the notion of "desirable" GenAI outputs based on accuracy, format adherence and relevance.
- Identifies prompt engineering as a key practice for achieving desirable outputs.
- Formally defines "prompt smells" and provides examples of different types. 
- Correlates prompt smells to undesirable or inexplainable outputs.
- Calls for more structured prompt engineering practices and standards to mitigate prompt smells.
- Warns that automatic prompting could exacerbate prompt smells if not done carefully.
- Proposes developing a taxonomy of prompt smells to improve GenAI's trustworthiness.

In summary, the paper makes an important connection between poor prompt engineering practices and issues with GenAI models, while proposing prompt smells as a way to trace, explain and improve GenAI reliability. Developing more disciplined and transparent prompt engineering is positioned as a priority for expanding GenAI's capabilities responsibly.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces the concept of "prompt smells" - characteristics of poorly designed prompts that can lead to undesirable or unexpected outputs from generative AI models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and definition of the concept of "prompt smells". Specifically:

The paper defines prompt smells as "semantic or syntactic characteristics of a prompt instance resulting from (unintentionally) imprecise prompt engineering. Prompt smells can lead to issues related to (i) the desirability of the outputs, (ii) the lack of explainability of the generation process, or (iii) the traces between the input and the output, especially in chain-of-thought strategies."

The paper argues that the presence of prompt smells, arising from misguided prompt engineering efforts, poses a significant challenge to achieving accurate, reliable, and replicable outputs from generative AI models. 

The paper proposes that identifying prompt smells and using them to trace back the source of the problem will enable improved explainability and transparency, which is crucial for trustworthiness of AI systems.

The paper also warns against potential negative trends like automatic prompting exacerbating prompt smells and unintended outcomes from generative AI models.

In summary, the key contribution is the conceptualization and definition of "prompt smells" as an important consideration in prompt engineering and a factor that can undermine trust in generative AI if not properly addressed. The paper lays the groundwork for further research into cataloging, identifying and mitigating prompt smells.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "prompt smells". What are some examples of prompt smells and how could they negatively impact the desirability, explainability, or traceability of AI-generated outputs?

2. The paper proposes a definition for the "desirability" of AI outputs. What are the three key factors included in this definition and why are they important for determining the quality of generative AI outputs? 

3. The authors draw parallels between prompt engineering and software engineering practices like code smells. What specifically do they claim is similar about these two engineering processes and what common challenges exist in both?

4. The paper introduces a "best of three" (BO3) strategy to detect AI hallucinations. How exactly does this strategy work and why is it needed in addition to identifying prompt smells?  

5. What role does automatic prompting play in potentially increasing prompt smells and how could it exacerbate issues like extrinsic hallucinations, according to the authors?

6. What solutions do the authors propose for mitigating issues caused by prompt smells and what further research do they advocate as necessary in this problem space?

7. How do the authors categorize different use case scenarios based on the quality of prompts and outputs? What is a "preferred scenario" versus a "standard case scenario"?  

8. The authors claim traceability is important for AI trustworthiness. What specifically enables traceability in the context of generative AI and why is it useful?

9. What negative trends does the paper identify related to automatic prompting and what cautions around its use do the authors raise as a result?

10. How could the concept of prompt smells be standardized or formalized to improve generative AI outcomes across use cases? What specific next steps do the authors recommend?
