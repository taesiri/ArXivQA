# [MOTRv2: Bootstrapping End-to-End Multi-Object Tracking by Pretrained   Object Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:

How to improve the performance of end-to-end multi-object tracking frameworks like MOTR by incorporating knowledge from a pretrained object detector? 

The key hypothesis is that using a pretrained high-performance object detector like YOLOX to generate proposals can help the end-to-end MOTR tracker concentrate more on the association task rather than struggling with detection. This can allow MOTR to achieve better overall performance.

In summary, the paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that incorporating a powerful external object detector can help boost the performance of end-to-end MOT frameworks like MOTR which have traditionally lagged behind detection-based trackers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing MOTRv2, an improved end-to-end multiple object tracking framework that elegantly incorporates a pretrained object detector YOLOX to provide high-quality object proposals. This greatly improves the detection performance compared to the original MOTR.

- Introducing anchor-based modeling of queries in MOTR, where YOLOX proposals serve as anchors to provide localization priors. This reduces the complexity of joint detection and association in MOTR.

- Achieving state-of-the-art tracking performance on challenging datasets like DanceTrack, outperforming previous end-to-end as well as tracking-by-detection methods.

- Proposing techniques like track query alignment to further enhance MOTRv2's performance on MOTChallenge benchmarks. 

- Demonstrating the potential of end-to-end tracking with proper incorporation of a detector, breaking the common belief that end-to-end frameworks are inferior for high-performance MOT.

In summary, the key innovation is augmenting MOTR with a pretrained detector to get the best of both worlds - end-to-end association capability of MOTR and robust detection of YOLOX. This simple yet effective design provides new insights into end-to-end MOT.
