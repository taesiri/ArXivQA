# [MOTRv2: Bootstrapping End-to-End Multi-Object Tracking by Pretrained   Object Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:

How to improve the performance of end-to-end multi-object tracking frameworks like MOTR by incorporating knowledge from a pretrained object detector? 

The key hypothesis is that using a pretrained high-performance object detector like YOLOX to generate proposals can help the end-to-end MOTR tracker concentrate more on the association task rather than struggling with detection. This can allow MOTR to achieve better overall performance.

In summary, the paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that incorporating a powerful external object detector can help boost the performance of end-to-end MOT frameworks like MOTR which have traditionally lagged behind detection-based trackers.
