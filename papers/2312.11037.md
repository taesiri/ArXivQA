# [SinMPI: Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image with Expanded   Multiplane Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11037)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of single-image novel view synthesis, which aims to generate an infinite number of consistent novel views from a single input image. Although there has been significant progress, most methods struggle to expand the underlying 3D scene representation and model missing geometry, resulting in blurred or flickering results, especially in occluded regions.

Method: 
The paper proposes SinMPI, a novel approach that uses an expanded multiplane image (MPI) to represent the scene. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage Stable Diffusion to generate out-of-view image content and align depths. 

2) Develop a depth-aware warping and inpainting module to complete missing areas in novel views.

3) Initialize and optimize an expanded MPI using larger planes and wider frustum to allow larger camera movements. Volume rendering is used to alleviate discretization artifacts.

4) Aggregate local rays with a trainable filter for smoother optimization and rendering.

The expanded MPI is optimized using perceptual losses between rendered views and pseudo-views from the inpainting module.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes SinMPI, which uses an expanded MPI for single-image novel view synthesis with wider camera movements.

2) Significantly enhances capacity over previous MPI methods via scene expansion and volume rendering optimization.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art quality on single-image novel view synthesis across real and synthetic datasets. Demonstrates scene editing capabilities.

4) Provides insights into design choices through detailed ablation studies on inpainting and MPI components.

In summary, SinMPI advances single-image novel view synthesis by optimizing an expanded MPI scene representation from a single view, enabling high quality, 3D consistent rendering and editing from a wide range of novel views. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate superiority over existing methods.
