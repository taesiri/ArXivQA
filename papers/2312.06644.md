 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces AnyHome, a novel framework for generating customizable, house-scale 3D indoor scenes from open-vocabulary text descriptions. Drawing inspiration from theories of environmental cognition, AnyHome represents scenes using a hierarchical structured geometry while leveraging egocentric viewpoints to enhance realism. The pipeline starts by comprehending and expanding user text prompts with a large language model. It then converts the textual descriptions into an intermediate graph representation to synthesize the spatial layout and object placements. To refine the geometry and add realistic texture, AnyHome generates an egocentric camera trajectory and employs a depth-aware neural renderer for view-consistent texture inpainting. A key advantage is AnyHomeâ€™s versatility in interpreting free-form text to create diverse scene structures across various levels of detail. Experiments demonstrate it can reliably produce intricate indoor environments with custom room types and layouts, realistic materials and lighting, and overall visual quality closely matching the textual narratives. The customizable language-based control and visually compelling results make AnyHome well-suited for applications like interior design, gaming, VR/AR experiences, and training simulations.
