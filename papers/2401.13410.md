# [How to Forget Clients in Federated Online Learning to Rank?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated online learning to rank (FOLTR) systems allow multiple clients to collaboratively train a ranking model without sharing local data. 
- Existing FOLTR systems lack a mechanism for "unlearning" - removing a client's contributions if they leave the federation (e.g. due to privacy regulations like GDPR right to be forgotten). 
- Designing an efficient unlearning method is challenging. Naively retraining from scratch is computationally expensive. Also, how to evaluate if unlearning is effective is unclear since a single client's impact may be marginal.

Method:
- The authors adapt an existing federated unlearning method called FedEraser to the FOLTR setting. 
- Historic local updates from each client are stored and reused to guide retraining the model after a client leaves, avoiding full retraining.
- To evaluate unlearning, the leaving client performs a poisoning attack, compromising their updates before departure. If unlearning is effective, removing this client should improve model performance.

Experiments:
- Evaluation uses 4 learning-to-rank datasets with simulated user clicks. A federation of 10 clients is assumed, with 1 unlearned.
- Results show the unlearning method efficiently removes the poisoning client's contributions, converging to effectiveness as if that client never participated.
- Analysis examines the method's sensitivity to key hyperparameters like number of local steps and interval between stored updates.

Contributions:
- First investigation of unlearning mechanisms tailored to federated online learning to rank
- Adaptation of existing federated unlearning approach to suit FOLTR's unique characteristics 
- Poisoning-based evaluation method to test if a client's contributions are forgotten
- Empirical analysis on multiple datasets demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed unlearning approach


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes and evaluates an efficient unlearning method for Federated Online Learning to Rank systems that can remove a client's contributions without compromising overall ranker effectiveness or needing full retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

This is the first study that investigates unlearning in Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) systems. Specifically, the authors:

1) Adapt the FedEraser unlearning method from general federated learning to the context of FOLTR, where rankers are learned online on implicit user interactions. They also modify it to leverage stored historical updates to accelerate unlearning.

2) Propose an evaluation methodology for FOLTR unlearning based on poisoning attacks, to measure if a client's contributions are effectively removed from the ranker. 

3) Conduct experiments on 4 LTR datasets demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of their unlearning approach. The results show the updated global model converges to the effectiveness as if the removed client did not originally participate, with less computation than retraining from scratch.

In summary, this paper provides the first benchmark and analysis of unlearning mechanisms tailored for federated online learning to rank.

Specifically, the paper investigates the problem of unlearning in Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) systems, where a user (client) can request their contributions to a learned ranking model to be removed, as contemplated by legislation like GDPR's right to be forgotten. The paper proposes and evaluates an efficient approximate unlearning method, and uses a poisoning attack strategy to evaluate whether the contributions of a client have been effectively erased from the learned model after unlearning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the unlearning method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper adapts the FedEraser method for unlearning in general federated learning to the context of federated online learning to rank. What are the key challenges and modifications needed to make FedEraser suitable for unlearning in federated online learning to rank systems?

2. The paper proposes using stored historical local updates to guide and accelerate the unlearning process. What is the intuition behind using these historical updates? And what are the potential tradeoffs with regards to storage costs versus faster unlearning? 

3. The paper evaluates unlearning effectiveness using a poisoning attack method adapted from the federated learning literature. Why is this poisoning attack method preferred over simply comparing model accuracy before and after unlearning? What assumptions does this evaluation method make?

4. How does the proposed unlearning method balance efficiency and effectiveness? What are the key tradeoffs with regards to the hyperparameters n'_i and Δt? Provide examples from the experimental results.  

5. The experimental results in Table 2 show that effectiveness generally decreases as Δt increases. However, there are a few exceptions to this trend. What might explain these exceptions?

6. For real-world deployment, what practical considerations need to be made regarding storing local updates on client devices versus the central server? What are the tradeoffs regarding communication costs?

7. The paper considers a simple federated setup with 10 clients and does not address non-IID data distributions. How might non-IID data impact the proposed unlearning method and evaluation approach?  

8. Can the proposed poisoning attack based evaluation generalize to scenarios with a large number of federated learning clients? Why or why not?

9. The paper focuses on selective unlearning of a single client's contributions. How feasible would it be to extend the proposed approach to simultaneously unlearn multiple clients? What new challenges might arise?

10. What directions for future work emerge from this initial study of unlearning in federated online learning to rank systems? What open questions need further investigation?
