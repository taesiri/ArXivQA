# [On Distillation of Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03142)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper tries to address is:

How can we efficiently distill classifier-free guided diffusion models into models that require significantly fewer sampling steps while maintaining high sample quality?

The key contributions seem to be:

1) Proposing a two-stage distillation approach to distill classifier-free guided diffusion models into faster sampling models. 

2) Demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach on both pixel-space diffusion models (e.g. DDPM) and latent-space diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion).

3) Showing that the distilled models can generate high quality samples using as few as 1-4 sampling steps, reducing inference cost by 10x or more compared to the original models.

4) Extending the distillation framework to stochastic sampling and demonstrating applications like text-guided image editing.

In summary, the paper focuses on developing distillation techniques to improve the sampling efficiency of guided diffusion models, which are otherwise quite slow due to needing to evaluate multiple models per sampling step. The main hypothesis seems to be that effective distillation can reduce the sampling cost substantially while maintaining output quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a two-stage distillation approach to distill classifier-free guided diffusion models into faster models that require fewer sampling steps. 

2. Applying the distillation approach to diffusion models trained on both the pixel space (e.g. DDPMs) and latent space (e.g. Stable Diffusion). Showing the approach can reduce sampling steps by up to 256x for pixel space models and 10x for latent space models.

3. Demonstrating the distilled models can achieve comparable or better sample quality as the original models using only a few sampling steps, on tasks like class-conditional sampling, text-to-image generation, image editing, and inpainting.

4. Introducing a stochastic sampling process for the distilled models that can further improve sample diversity.

5. Showing the distilled models allow efficiently trading off between sample quality and diversity by varying the guidance strength with a single model.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an effective distillation framework to accelerate inference for guided diffusion models, enabling their practical application in areas like image generation and editing. The method is shown to work for both pixel-space and latent-space models.
