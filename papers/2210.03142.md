# [On Distillation of Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03142)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper tries to address is:

How can we efficiently distill classifier-free guided diffusion models into models that require significantly fewer sampling steps while maintaining high sample quality?

The key contributions seem to be:

1) Proposing a two-stage distillation approach to distill classifier-free guided diffusion models into faster sampling models. 

2) Demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach on both pixel-space diffusion models (e.g. DDPM) and latent-space diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion).

3) Showing that the distilled models can generate high quality samples using as few as 1-4 sampling steps, reducing inference cost by 10x or more compared to the original models.

4) Extending the distillation framework to stochastic sampling and demonstrating applications like text-guided image editing.

In summary, the paper focuses on developing distillation techniques to improve the sampling efficiency of guided diffusion models, which are otherwise quite slow due to needing to evaluate multiple models per sampling step. The main hypothesis seems to be that effective distillation can reduce the sampling cost substantially while maintaining output quality.
