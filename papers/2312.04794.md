# [Visual Grounding of Whole Radiology Reports for 3D CT Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04794)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes the first visual grounding framework for 3D CT images and corresponding radiology reports. The key challenges in grounding CT images include dealing with diverse anomaly types across the whole body, and interpreting long, complex reports describing multiple findings. To address these issues, the method introduces anatomical segmentation of CT images to provide organ masks as spatial context, and report structuring via a BERT model to extract anomalies and related phrases from reports. With these additional inputs, the grounding model can more accurately localize anatomical areas descriptions refer to. For evaluation, region-level annotations were created for over 17k anomaly regions across 10k CT studies. Experiments demonstrate the proposed techniques of anatomical segmentation and report structuring significantly boost performance, with dice score improving from 27.4% to 34.5% and grounding accuracy from 66.0% to 77.8%. Comparisons to other visual grounding methods also indicate the state-of-the-art results achieved for this novel and challenging task. Key future work is expanding anomaly categories and improving rare anomaly grounding performance in large anatomy. Overall, this paper makes notable progress towards automated understanding of rich radiology reports paired with volumetric imaging.
