# [Multi-Space Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods to render high-quality novel views of scenes containing reflective/refractive objects, without needing manual labeling of the reflective surfaces. The key hypothesis is that decomposing the scene into multiple "virtual sub-spaces" that each satisfy multi-view consistency can allow rendering of complex reflections and refractions where multi-view consistency is violated in the real Euclidean space.The main contributions are:- Proposing a multi-space NeRF method that can automatically handle mirror-like objects in 360-degree scene rendering.- Designing a lightweight module that can equip NeRF-like methods with the ability to model reflection/refraction. - Constructing a 360-degree dataset of synthetic and real scenes with complex reflections/refractions for method evaluation.- Demonstrating superior performance of the proposed approach by integrating it with various NeRF baseline methods, without needing extra manual labeling.In summary, the paper introduces a multi-space radiance field approach to enable high-quality novel view synthesis of reflective/refractive scenes by NeRF-like methods in an automatic way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) method that represents scenes using multiple feature fields in parallel sub-spaces instead of a single radiance field. This allows it to better handle reflective and refractive objects where multi-view consistency is violated.- It designs a lightweight multi-space module that can be integrated into existing NeRF models like NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360, equipping them with the ability to handle complex reflections and refractions.- It constructs a new dataset of 25 synthetic and 7 real captured scenes containing challenging reflective and refractive objects captured from 360 degree viewpoints. This serves as a benchmark to evaluate rendering such complex scenes.- It demonstrates superior performance of the proposed MS-NeRF approach over existing NeRF methods like NeRF, Mip-NeRF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Ref-NeRF on the complex scenes with reflections and refractions in the new dataset, while adding only a small overhead.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a multi-space radiance field method to handle complex reflections and refractions by decomposing the scene into parallel sub-spaces. The lightweight design makes it easy to integrate into existing NeRF models to enhance their capabilities. The new dataset provides challenging benchmark scenes to validate these capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) method to handle reflective surfaces in 360-degree rendering by decomposing the scene into multiple virtual sub-spaces that each satisfy multi-view consistency, demonstrating significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing NeRF methods on a new synthetic and real dataset of scenes with complex reflections and refractions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on neural radiance fields (NeRF):- It addresses a major limitation of existing NeRF methods - their inability to handle reflective/refractive surfaces well. The paper proposes a multi-space radiance field approach to overcome this limitation. This is a novel contribution compared to prior NeRF papers.- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed multi-space radiance field method by integrating it with several existing NeRF architectures like vanilla NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360. Showing improved performance over these strong baselines highlights the value of the proposed approach.- The paper introduces a new dataset of synthetic and real scenes containing reflections/refractions to benchmark methods on this challenging setting. Many existing NeRF datasets lack such complex lighting effects, so this is a valuable new resource.- Compared to some other related works that require extra supervision like manual masks or input images with ground truth normals, this method is fully unsupervised. This could make it more practical to apply.- The design of the multi-space module is lightweight and has low computational overhead. This makes it easy to integrate with many existing NeRF models, enhancing their capabilities.- While competitive with highly specialized models like NeRF-Ren on reflective surfaces, the general applicability of this method to various NeRF architectures is broader. It does not require redesigning the whole pipeline.Overall, the paper makes a useful contribution in addressing an important limitation of NeRF models through a novel multi-space radiance field approach. The integration with various architectures and introduction of a new challenging benchmark dataset are also valuable additions compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Applying the multi-space neural radiance field idea to other neural rendering methods beyond NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360. The authors suggest their lightweight multi-space module could likely enhance many other NeRF-like architectures.- Exploring if the multi-space formulation could help with modeling other scene properties beyond just reflection and refraction, such as occlusion, transparency, etc. - Extending the multi-space formulation to model dynamic scenes with moving objects, non-rigid deformations, etc.- Developing more rigorous theoretical understanding of why the multi-space formulation helps overcome issues like violation of multi-view consistency in certain scenes.- Exploring if ideas from physics and graphics like decomposition into direct and global illumination components could further enhance the multi-space formulation.- Applying the multi-space radiance field idea to tasks beyond novel view synthesis, like 3D-aware editing, neural avatars, etc.- Developing more complex non-uniform space decomposition strategies instead of just parallel uniform sub-spaces.- Expanding the multi-space dataset with more photo-realistic rendered and real world captured scenes.So in summary, the authors point to many exciting avenues for future work in terms of applying multi-space NeRF to new methods and tasks, developing more advanced multi-space modeling ideas, and producing more rigorous theory and more diverse training data. Enhancing neural rendering with multi-space formulations seems like a very promising research direction according to the authors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) method to better handle rendering reflective and refractive objects in scenes. Existing NeRF methods struggle with objects like mirrors because they violate the assumption of multi-view consistency that NeRF relies on. The proposed MS-NeRF approach represents a scene using multiple parallel feature fields that correspond to different virtual sub-spaces. This allows handling of reflective surfaces by placing virtual images in certain sub-spaces visible only from relevant views. The multi-space scheme is implemented through a lightweight module that can be integrated with existing NeRF methods like vanilla NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360. Experiments on a new dataset of 25 synthetic and 7 real captured 360 degree scenes with reflections/refractions show MS-NeRF significantly outperforms previous methods on metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. The module brings improvements with minimal extra parameters. Overall, the MS-NeRF approach serves as an effective enhancement to equip conventional NeRF methods with the ability to model complex reflections and refractions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) approach to improve rendering of scenes with reflective surfaces for neural radiance fields (NeRF). Existing NeRF methods struggle with reflective surfaces because the virtual images they create violate the multi-view consistency that NeRF relies on. The proposed MS-NeRF method represents the scene using multiple parallel feature fields corresponding to different virtual sub-spaces. This allows handling of complex reflections and refractions where multi-view consistency is violated in the real Euclidean space. A lightweight multi-space module is designed which can be integrated with existing NeRF methods like NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360 with minimal overhead. The method is evaluated on a newly constructed dataset with 25 synthetic 360-degree scenes and 7 real captured scenes exhibiting complex reflections and refractions. Experiments demonstrate significant quantitative and qualitative improvements when the multi-space module is added to different baseline NeRF methods. The approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art on reflective surface rendering without needing any manual labeling. Ablation studies validate the design decisions and analyze the relation between number of sub-spaces and virtual images. The MS-NeRF approach provides a general enhancement to equip most NeRF methods with better handling of reflections and refractions.
