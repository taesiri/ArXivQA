# [Multi-Space Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods to render high-quality novel views of scenes containing reflective/refractive objects, without needing manual labeling of the reflective surfaces. The key hypothesis is that decomposing the scene into multiple "virtual sub-spaces" that each satisfy multi-view consistency can allow rendering of complex reflections and refractions where multi-view consistency is violated in the real Euclidean space.The main contributions are:- Proposing a multi-space NeRF method that can automatically handle mirror-like objects in 360-degree scene rendering.- Designing a lightweight module that can equip NeRF-like methods with the ability to model reflection/refraction. - Constructing a 360-degree dataset of synthetic and real scenes with complex reflections/refractions for method evaluation.- Demonstrating superior performance of the proposed approach by integrating it with various NeRF baseline methods, without needing extra manual labeling.In summary, the paper introduces a multi-space radiance field approach to enable high-quality novel view synthesis of reflective/refractive scenes by NeRF-like methods in an automatic way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) method that represents scenes using multiple feature fields in parallel sub-spaces instead of a single radiance field. This allows it to better handle reflective and refractive objects where multi-view consistency is violated.- It designs a lightweight multi-space module that can be integrated into existing NeRF models like NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360, equipping them with the ability to handle complex reflections and refractions.- It constructs a new dataset of 25 synthetic and 7 real captured scenes containing challenging reflective and refractive objects captured from 360 degree viewpoints. This serves as a benchmark to evaluate rendering such complex scenes.- It demonstrates superior performance of the proposed MS-NeRF approach over existing NeRF methods like NeRF, Mip-NeRF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Ref-NeRF on the complex scenes with reflections and refractions in the new dataset, while adding only a small overhead.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a multi-space radiance field method to handle complex reflections and refractions by decomposing the scene into parallel sub-spaces. The lightweight design makes it easy to integrate into existing NeRF models to enhance their capabilities. The new dataset provides challenging benchmark scenes to validate these capabilities.
