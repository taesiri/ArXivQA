# [CurbNet: Curb Detection Framework Based on LiDAR Point Cloud   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Curb detection is crucial for autonomous vehicles to determine drivable areas, but curbs are difficult to detect due to their thin, long structure and complex road environments. Challenges include (1) extracting the subtle height difference feature of curbs (2) uneven distribution of curb point clouds from LiDAR (3) imbalance between small quantity of curb point clouds versus other categories.

Proposed Solution - CurbNet Framework:
1) Introduced a comprehensive 3D-Curb dataset with 7100 frames of point clouds covering diverse road scenes, which is the largest and most categorically diverse curb dataset currently.

2) Proposed a Multi-Scale and Channel Attention (MSCA) module in the CNN encoder-decoder structure tailored to curb distribution, enhancing multi-scale feature fusion and focusing on height difference features.  

3) Developed an adaptive loss function group of Adaptive Cross-Entropy and Lov√°sz-Softmax Loss to address class imbalance during training.

4) Implemented a post-processing approach of multi-clustering and curve fitting to reduce noise in detection results.

Main Contributions:
1) Established the largest and most comprehensive 3D-Curb dataset with 7100 frames and 3D annotations.

2) Proposed the MSCA module and imbalance loss strategy specially designed for curb distribution characteristics.  

3) Achieved state-of-the-art curb detection performance, with average metrics over 0.95 at just 0.15m tolerance.

4) Enhanced precision to 0.8744 through multi-cluster fitting post-processing that removes noise.

5) Validated exceptional detection proficiency and robust generalizability of CurbNet through extensive experiments on datasets and real-world scenes.
