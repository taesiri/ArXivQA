# [MACCA: Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Causal Credit   Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03644)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called MACCA for performing credit assignment in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). It models the generative process underlying how team rewards arise from individual agent rewards using a dynamic Bayesian network. Specifically, it learns parameterized masks over state and action dimensions to identify which dimensions causally influence each agent's individual reward, as well as predictor functions to estimate per-agent rewards. This allows decomposing overall team rewards into constituent individual rewards even when only team rewards are provided in the offline training data. The method's modularity also enables it to be integrated with existing offline MARL algorithms like CQL, OMAR, and ICQ to improve their performance. Through experiments on cooperative navigation, predator-prey, and adversary avoidance tasks, MACCA variants demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for offline MARL. Ablation studies provide evidence that appropriately learning sparse causal structures and using predicted individual rewards to replace team rewards in policy updates are important to MACCA's strong performance. The method thus offers an interpretable approach to addressing the credit assignment problem for offline MARL.
