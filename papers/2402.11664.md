# [Interpretable Short-Term Load Forecasting via Multi-Scale Temporal   Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11664)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is important for power grid operations to balance supply and demand. 
- Deep learning models have enabled highly accurate STLF, but lack interpretability into their internal decision-making processes.
- There is a need for STLF methods that provide both high accuracy and model interpretability, to understand load behaviors and trends.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes an interpretable deep learning method for STLF based on multi-scale temporal decomposition and additive modeling. 

- It decomposes the load time series into trend and seasonal components at multiple time scales using convolution kernels.

- These components are fed as separate inputs into Transformers and CNNs which specialize in low and high frequency patterns.  

- For auxiliary features like temperature, representations are learned using LSTMs and linearly combined.

- The output is a linear combination of all the neural network modules, with the coefficients indicating feature significance.

Main Contributions:

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for STLF based on public Belgian load data, outperforming baselines.

- Provides both temporal and auxiliary feature interpretability for the load forecasting model via significance scores.

- Demonstrates the generalization capability of feature interpretations on unseen test data from Belgium and Australia.

- Enables understanding global load behaviors and trends, like the most influential temporal cycles and external factors.

- Has a flexible structure to handle diverse load patterns by adjusting decomposition kernels.

In summary, the paper introduces an accurate yet interpretable STLF method using multi-scale decomposition and additive modeling. It explains model predictions through temporal cycles and auxiliary inputs that drive load changes. The global feature analysis offers useful insights for power system operators.
