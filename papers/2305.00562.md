# [Class-Balancing Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00562)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the performance of diffusion models when trained on imbalanced/long-tailed datasets. The key hypotheses are:

1) Standard diffusion models will degrade in performance, particularly in diversity and fidelity of generated images, when trained on imbalanced datasets where some classes have many more examples than others.

2) This performance degradation can be mitigated by adjusting the diffusion model training to account for the imbalanced class distribution. Specifically, by adding a regularization term to the loss function that increases similarity of generated images across different classes. 

3) This class-balancing regularization approach, implemented in the proposed Class-Balancing Diffusion Model (CBDM), will improve diversity and fidelity compared to standard diffusion models, especially for tail/minority classes.

In summary, the paper hypothesizes that standard diffusion models face challenges when trained on imbalanced data, and proposes a new regularization approach in the CBDM model to account for imbalanced class distributions and improve generation performance. The central questions are whether class imbalance hurts diffusion models, and whether the proposed CBDM method effectively addresses this problem.
