# [GLOP: Learning Global Partition and Local Construction for Solving   Large-scale Routing Problems in Real-time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08224)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GLOP, a unified hierarchical framework for solving large-scale routing problems like TSP, ATSP, CVRP, and PCTSP. GLOP hybridizes non-autoregressive neural heuristics for coarse-grained problem partitioning and autoregressive neural heuristics for fine-grained route construction. It first partitions large problems into sub-problems using learned heatmaps, then solves the sub-problems with neural networks trained on small instances. This combines the scalability of non-autoregressive models with the meticulousness of autoregressive ones. Experiments show GLOP achieves state-of-the-art real-time performance on routing benchmarks. Notably, it is the first neural solver to effectively scale to 100K-node TSP. The solution pipeline of GLOP is also applicable to different routing variants. Overall, GLOP pushes the boundary of neural combinatorial optimization by enhancing neural solvers to tackle large-scale problems in a parallelizable and efficient way.
