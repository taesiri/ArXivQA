# [Adaptive Smooth Activation for Improved Disease Diagnosis and Organ   Segmentation from Radiology Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11480)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate automated disease diagnosis and organ segmentation from medical images like CT and MRI scans is critical for treatment planning and diagnosis. However, performance of current deep learning methods is constrained by limitations of activation functions used in CNNs. 

- Common activation functions like ReLU lose information for negative inputs and fail to capture subtle anatomical details needed for medical image analysis. So specialized activation functions tailored for medical images are needed.

Method:
- The paper proposes a novel Adaptive Smooth Activation Unit (ASAU) designed specifically to handle challenges in medical image analysis. 

- ASAU uses a smoother, more continuous function that retains information across negative inputs and provides refined gradients to enable learning of intricate anatomical details.

- It is parameterized to enable adaptive approximation of max and ReLU functions for optimization.

Experiments:
- ASAU was tested on multi-class disease classification using Abdomen/Pelvis CT (28 classes) and MRI (26 classes) images from RadImageNet dataset.

- It was also tested for liver and tumor segmentation using CT scans from LiTS 2017 challenge dataset.

- ASAU consistently outperformed ReLU, Leaky ReLU and PReLU activations across ResNet architectures for classification and segmentation tasks.

Key Contributions:
- ASAU improves classification accuracy by 4.8% on RadImageNet and dice score for segmentation by 1-3% on LiTS over ReLU, demonstrating clear benefits.

- It sets a new state-of-the-art for multi-class abdominal disease classification and liver segmentation, highlighting applicability to various medical image analysis tasks.

- The results validate the adaptive smoothing approach of ASAU for enhanced learning of subtle anatomical details in medical images over traditional activations.
