# [TaskMet: Task-Driven Metric Learning for Model Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05250)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called TaskMet for task-based model learning that learns a metric parameterized by $\phi$ in the prediction space using gradients from the downstream task loss. Specifically, TaskMet solves a bilevel optimization problem where the inner level fits a prediction model $f_\theta$ by minimizing a metricized prediction loss defined by the learned metric $\Lambda_\phi$, while the outer level updates $\phi$ to minimize the downstream task loss $\mathcal{L}_{task}(f_\theta)$. By learning $\Lambda_\phi$ end-to-end using task gradients, TaskMet allows the model to focus on task-relevant features without altering the original prediction objective. This enables achieving good performance on both the prediction task and downstream task. The effectiveness of TaskMet is demonstrated through experiments on decision-focused learning scenarios like portfolio optimization and budget allocation as well as model-based RL. The key benefit is that by metric learning, TaskMet serves as a more interpretable preconditioning for gradient-based model training compared to directly using task gradients.
