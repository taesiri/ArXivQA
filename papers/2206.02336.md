# [Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Step-Aware Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02336)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models through better prompting techniques. Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called DiVeRSe (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Step) with three key innovations:1. Using diverse prompts to elicit different reasoning paths from the language model. The hypothesis is that different prompts can lead the model to explore different ways of reasoning to reach the correct answer. 2. Introducing a verifier to score the quality of each reasoning path and weigh their contributions through a voting scheme. The hypothesis is that not all reasoning paths generated by the model are equally reliable.3. Verifying each reasoning step individually and attributing the final answer's correctness to each step. The hypothesis is that some steps may be correct even if the final answer is wrong. Identifying these cases can further improve the reasoning process.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by increasing the diversity of reasoning paths, filtering them through a verifier, and analyzing them at a step-wise level, the reasoning capabilities of large language models can be significantly enhanced as measured on various benchmark datasets. DiVeRSe aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel method called DiVeRSe (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Step) to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models. The key ideas are:1. Using diverse prompts, instead of a single prompt, to elicit different reasoning paths from the model. This increases diversity and the chances of finding the correct reasoning path. 2. Introducing a verifier that scores each reasoning path to guide a voting mechanism for selecting the best final answer. This helps identify good reasoning paths from bad ones.3. Extending the verifier to judge each step of the reasoning path, rather than just the final answer. This allows attributing correctness/errors to individual steps. The method is evaluated on various reasoning tasks and consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving new SOTA results on 6 out of 8 benchmarks. The step-wise verifier in particular provides interpretability into the model's reasoning process. Overall, DiVeRSe advances the reasoning capabilities of large language models through its innovations in using diverse prompts, weighted voting, and step-level verification.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called DiVeRSe that improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models by using diverse prompts, a voting verifier, and step-wise verification of reasoning chains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on improving reasoning capabilities of large language models:- It builds on recent progress in using multi-step reasoning prompts to unlock latent reasoning skills in large LMs like GPT-3 and PaLM. Prior works like chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency showed big gains on reasoning benchmarks by having models generate explicit reasoning steps. - The main innovations in this paper are using diverse prompts, a voting verifier, and step-wise verification. Diverse prompts and sampling multiple reasoning paths helps increase diversity. The voting verifier scores each path to guide aggregation. Step-wise verification attributes credit/blame for the final answer to each reasoning step. - These ideas achieve new SOTA results on 6/8 reasoning benchmarks, outperforming prior results from self-consistency on the 540B parameter PaLM model. The improvements are especially large on arithmetic and inductive reasoning tasks.- Compared to methods using specialized symbolic knowledge (like KGs or rule systems), this approach is more general as it requires no domain-specific engineering. But it may be less interpretable or verifiable than symbolic systems.- Unlike some prior work focused on better pre-training or fine-tuning for reasoning, this method uses standard pretrained LMs like GPT-3 and focuses on better prompting strategies.- A limitation is the need for more training data with reasoning chains to construct prompts and train the verifier. But the analysis also shows good results with fairly small training sets.In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in few-shot reasoning with large LMs by creatively combining ideas like diverse prompting and step-wise verification. The gains are especially clear on math and inductive reasoning problems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Continuing to investigate ways to reduce or recognize false positive pseudo exemplars. The paper discusses how using pseudo exemplars generated through "self-teaching" for multiple-choice tasks like StrategyQA and CommonsenseQA can introduce noise and invalid reasoning paths that happen to yield the correct answer. The authors suggest further work on mitigating this issue.- Designing better methods for generating diverse prompts, beyond just randomly sampling prompts. The authors propose this could further enhance the diversity of reasoning paths.- Extending the proposed DiVeRSe approach to other tasks and researching additional prompting techniques to further elicit the capabilities of large language models. The authors aim to continue improving reasoning through techniques like DiVeRSe.- Enhancing the faithfulness of the reasoning paths generated by language models. The authors acknowledge this is a key challenge in the chain-of-thought reasoning approach.- Reducing the dependence on large computational resources. The authors note DiVeRSe currently relies on large language models which are more time and resource intensive. Making it work well with smaller models could help.- Using less training data with reasoning paths. The authors discuss how DiVeRSe needs more training data than few-shot approaches, and suggest investigating ways to further improve chain-of-thought reasoning with less data.- Developing better methods to evaluate reasoning step quality beyond human evaluation. The authors currently rely on human assessment of reasoning path steps due to limited prior work on evaluating step quality.So in summary, the main suggested directions are: improving prompt diversity, extending the approach to more tasks, enhancing reasoning path faithfulness, reducing computational needs, using less training data, and developing better step evaluation methods.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents DiVeRSe, a novel method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and PaLM. The key innovation is to guide the LLM to produce multiple diverse reasoning paths before generating the final answer to a question. DiVeRSe has three main components: (1) It generates varied prompts to elicit different reasoning paths for the same question. (2) It utilizes a verifier to score each reasoning path and perform weighted voting to select the best final answer. (3) It introduces a step-aware verifier that checks the correctness of each reasoning step individually. The authors conduct extensive experiments on eight reasoning tasks requiring arithmetic, commonsense, and inductive reasoning skills. The results demonstrate that DiVeRSe brings significant and consistent improvements over strong baselines like chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency. Combining DiVeRSe with code-davinci-002 achieves new state-of-the-art performance on six of the eight benchmarks, outperforming even PaLM with 540B parameters on most arithmetic reasoning tasks. The analyses also verify the effectiveness of the key components like diverse prompts, voting verifier, and step-level verification. Overall, DiVeRSe provides an effective and general framework to improve reasoning of LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method proposed in this paper is \textsc{DiVeRSe} (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Step), which aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. \textsc{DiVeRSe} has three key components:1) It generates diverse prompts by sampling different sets of exemplars to explore different reasoning paths for the same question. 2) It introduces a verifier module that is trained to distinguish good answers from bad answers and guide a weighted voting scheme for selecting the final answer. 3) It verifies each reasoning step individually rather than judging the whole reasoning chain together.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The main problem this paper is addressing is how to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. Specifically, it focuses on improving their performance on reasoning tasks that require multiple steps to derive the correct answer, such as arithmetic problems from the GSM8K benchmark. The paper builds on recent work that guides language models through reasoning tasks by prompting them to generate chains of reasoning steps before outputting the final answer. However, previous methods have limitations in diversity of reasoning paths, scoring/selecting good paths, and identifying useful steps within incorrect paths. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new approach called DiVeRSe (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Step) with three main innovations:1. Using diverse prompts to elicit different reasoning paths instead of relying on sampling from a single fixed prompt. 2. Introducing a verifier model to score the quality of each reasoning path and guide the selection of the final answer.3. Assigning fine-grained correctness labels to each step and training the verifier in a step-aware manner.The goal is to make large language models better at multi-step reasoning by exploiting diversity, verification, and step-level supervision. Experiments show consistent and significant gains over prior methods on arithmetic, commonsense, and inductive reasoning benchmarks.
