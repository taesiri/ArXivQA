# [Descripción automática de secciones delgadas de rocas: una   aplicación Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: The traditional method of rock thin section identification and characterization requires extensive knowledge and experience from human experts, which introduces subjectivity, is time-consuming and prone to inherent biases. In contrast, AI can automate tasks efficiently while minimizing human errors and subjectivity.  

Proposed Solution: The authors develop an automatic text and speech description system for rock thin sections using AI techniques combining computer vision and natural language processing. They create a dataset of 5,600 thin section images organized into 14 rock types, each with a corresponding textual description considering relevant parameters like rock type, texture, main minerals, habits, relief or interference colors. This dataset trains a model combining a convolutional neural network (EfficientNetB7) to extract visual features from the images, and a Transformer network to generate the textual descriptions.

Main Contributions:
1) Extensive thin section image dataset with 14 rock categories and textual descriptions.
2) Automatic description model combining CNN for image feature extraction and Transformer for text generation. Best model uses EfficientNetB7 and obtains 0.892 accuracy and 0.71 BLEU score.
3) Analysis of model capabilities and limitations using BLEU score for each description parameter. Best results for rock type, texture and interference colors. Lower results for minerals, forms and habits.
4) User-friendly web application for public use, where users can upload their own images and obtain textual and verbal rock descriptions. Enables collaborative model enhancement.

The model shows potential for practical applications in geology, mining, oil industry, construction and environmental assessments. Future work involves expanding the dataset diversity, testing model adaptations like semantic segmentation and object detection, and analyzing altered rock samples. Overall, an excellent effort advancing AI-assisted geological analysis.
