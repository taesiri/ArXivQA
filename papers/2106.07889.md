# [UnivNet: A Neural Vocoder with Multi-Resolution Spectrogram   Discriminators for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07889)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high-fidelity and real-time speech waveforms using neural vocoders while alleviating the over-smoothing problem. 

The key hypotheses are:

- Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input can provide more acoustic information to the vocoder for reconstructing high-fidelity waveforms compared to band-limited mel-spectrograms.

- Adding a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs spectrograms of different resolutions as input can help generate high-resolution signals over the full band and alleviate over-smoothing.

- Combining multi-period waveform and multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators can allow modeling both spectral and temporal details better to generate fine-grained realistic waveforms.

So in summary, the main research goal is developing a neural vocoder that can synthesize high-quality and real-time speech while addressing the over-smoothing issue, by using full-band spectrograms and multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators.
