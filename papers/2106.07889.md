# [UnivNet: A Neural Vocoder with Multi-Resolution Spectrogram   Discriminators for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07889)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high-fidelity and real-time speech waveforms using neural vocoders while alleviating the over-smoothing problem. 

The key hypotheses are:

- Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input can provide more acoustic information to the vocoder for reconstructing high-fidelity waveforms compared to band-limited mel-spectrograms.

- Adding a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs spectrograms of different resolutions as input can help generate high-resolution signals over the full band and alleviate over-smoothing.

- Combining multi-period waveform and multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators can allow modeling both spectral and temporal details better to generate fine-grained realistic waveforms.

So in summary, the main research goal is developing a neural vocoder that can synthesize high-quality and real-time speech while addressing the over-smoothing issue, by using full-band spectrograms and multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing UnivNet, a neural vocoder that can generate high-fidelity waveforms in real time. 

2. Adding a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator (MRSD) to UnivNet that uses multiple linear spectrograms computed with different parameters as input. This helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem and generate high-resolution signals.

3. Evaluating UnivNet on a large multi-speaker English dataset. UnivNet achieves the best objective and subjective scores among competing models for both seen and unseen speakers.

4. Demonstrating UnivNet's ability to rapidly adapt to new speakers through fine-tuning without training from scratch. In text-to-speech evaluation, UnivNet obtains the best subjective score. 

5. Ablation studies showing the contributions of various components of UnivNet like the location variable convolution layers, gated activation units, MRSD and multi-period waveform discriminator.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing UnivNet, a vocoder architecture that leverages multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators to generate high-fidelity and real-time waveforms while adapting well to new speakers. The effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations.
