# [Docking Multirotors in Close Proximity using Learnt Downwash Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13988)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a framework for enabling close-proximity aerial docking of two multirotor vehicles. A leader vehicle carries a docking platform while a follower vehicle attempts to physically dock with it. However, the significant downwash disturbances from the leader pose a major challenge. To address this, the authors learn a model of the downwash forces using only 5 minutes of real-world flight data. This model accurately captures the complex aerodynamics between the vehicles. It is then deployed online in an optimal control framework running fully onboard the follower vehicle. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate a 3-4x reduction in tracking error for the follower, allowing it to approach within two body lengths of the leader. This enables, for the first time, a smooth docking maneuver between two airborne multirotors separated by only 36cm vertically. Overall, the learned downwash model proves critical for compensating aerodynamic effects in close-proximity multirobot missions. The authors' geometry-based learning approach also promises advances in other applications requiring accurate modeling of complex spatial phenomena.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a framework to compensate for downwash on a follower multirotor by learning a model from flight data and using it within an optimal controller, enabling two vehicles to successfully dock in close vertical proximity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing a framework for close-proximity aerial docking of multirotors by compensating for downwash disturbances using a learned model. Specifically:

- They build a learned model to predict the downwash forces from the leader multirotor acting on the follower, using only 5 minutes of real-world flight data. This model exploits rotational symmetries and is sample efficient.

- They embed this learned downwash model online within an optimal control framework running fully onboard the follower multirotor. This allows it to accurately track a docking maneuver trajectory while experiencing significant downwash interference from the leader vehicle in close proximity (within 1-2 body lengths).

- Through real-world experiments with different docking maneuvers and configurations, they demonstrate that using this learned compensation enables docking with much smaller vertical separations (e.g. 0.36m) compared to conventional approaches. This reduces risks associated with long cables.

- They showcase the complete system by successfully performing an aerial docking between two flying multirotors using a smooth planned trajectory, while maintaining accuracy of within 6cm even when less than 2 body lengths away.

In summary, the key contribution is a learned model-based control framework to enable safe and accurate close proximity docking of multirotors, which has not been demonstrated before.

The paper focuses on enabling aerial docking of two multirotor vehicles in very close vertical proximity by learning a model to compensate for the downwash aerodynamic disturbances from the leader vehicle. Key elements include using geometric learning to efficiently model the downwash forces, embedding this model in an optimal control framework, and demonstrating successful docking maneuvers and formation flight with the leader and follower vehicles separated by only 1-2 body lengths.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a curriculum approach for capturing downwash data, with the training divided into multiple stages that gradually decrease the separation between the vehicles. What are some of the key challenges and considerations when designing an appropriate curriculum for this problem? How is the progression between stages determined?

2. The paper models the downwash forces as a collective external force vector acting on the follower vehicle's body frame. What are some limitations of this simplified model? Could a more sophisticated representation like a spatio-temporal flow field provide additional benefits?

3. The feature mapping in Equation 2 enforces equivariance of the learned model over the SO(2) group to exploit rotational symmetries. How does this feature mapping work? Why is this useful compared to learning on the raw state directly?

4. The paper uses an LQR controller for trajectory tracking on the follower quadrotor. How was this controller designed? What are the tradeoffs with using a more complex nonlinear controller? Could the same downwash modeling approach be integrated with other types of controllers?

5. The docking mechanism uses a strain gauge sensor to detect contacts with the docking platform. What are some difficulties and failure cases associated with relying on contacts and thresholds for determining when to trigger the gripper? Could alternate sensing strategies help address this?

6. Table 1 shows that even at large vertical offsets between vehicles, the follower still experiences noticeable downwash disturbances. Why does the effect persist over such long distances? How is the magnitude of disturbance related to factors like vehicle size, rotor configurations etc.?  

7. The paper demonstrates successful docking with the leader in near-hover conditions. However, performance degrades significantly when the leader is moving. Why does the learned model fail to generalize adequately to leader movement? How can the training methodology and model representation be improved?

8. How sensitive is the performance to factors like wind disturbances and positioning errors? Since outdoors field experiments rely on noisy GPS, how can robustness be improved for real-world deployment?

9. The learned model is currently specialized to a particular leader vehicle geometry. How can the approach be extended to handle heterogeneous dockings with arbitrary leader platforms? What modifications would be required?

10. The paper focuses on leader-follower docking. Can similar downwash modeling strategies be applied to other multirobot problems like collaborative lifting, assembly etc? What additional considerations exist in other settings?
