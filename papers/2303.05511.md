# [Scaling up GANs for Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can GANs be scaled up to benefit from large datasets and generate high-quality images for open-ended text-to-image synthesis?

The authors note that GANs like StyleGAN have achieved impressive results on constrained datasets with a limited number of categories. However, scaling GANs up to handle the complexity of internet-scale datasets for arbitrary text-to-image generation has remained an open challenge. 

The paper introduces a new GAN architecture called GigaGAN that aims to overcome the limitations that have prevented GANs from scaling up effectively. The authors identify key issues like training instability and propose techniques like adaptive convolution kernels and multi-scale training to address them.

The central hypothesis is that with sufficient model capacity and careful tuning of the architecture and training scheme, GANs can be scaled up successfully to handle large-scale, diverse internet image datasets. The results of training the billion-parameter GigaGAN model on LAION provide evidence that GANs remain a viable option for text-to-image synthesis and have not yet reached their scaling limits.

In summary, the main research question is whether GANs can be scaled up to generate high-quality, diverse images from text descriptions on internet-scale datasets, overcoming prior challenges that have limited their applicability to large open-domain generative modeling tasks.
