# [On Tuning Neural ODE for Stability, Consistency and Faster Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01657)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) architecture with a Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) based ODE solver that is tuned to satisfy stability, consistency, and convergence (CCS) conditions. The key insight is that by constraining the ODE solver to meet CCS criteria, the neural ODE model trains faster and more stably. Specifically, the authors show that a two-step linear multi-step ODE solver method can be posed as NAG optimization, ensuring CCS conditions are met. Empirical evaluations on classification, density estimation, and time series modeling tasks demonstrate that the proposed Nesterov neural ODE often trains faster than neural ODEs with other common fixed-step explicit solvers and discrete ResNet models. Additionally, stability and convergence issues arising in baseline neural ODE models are avoided with the CCS-compliant Nesterov solver. The method does particularly well on density estimation. Key limitations and future work are also discussed, including exploring analogues for implicit, higher-order methods, and combining the approach with regularization or learned accelerations. Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution in developing more reliable and efficient neural differential equation models.
