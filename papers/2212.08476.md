# [SteerNeRF: Accelerating NeRF Rendering via Smooth Viewpoint Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08476)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we accelerate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) rendering by exploiting the typically smooth viewpoint trajectory during interactive viewpoint control?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The viewpoint trajectory is usually smooth and continuous during interactive viewpoint control. 

2) This smooth trajectory means there is significant information overlap between consecutive viewpoints.

3) By exploiting this, we can reduce the number of sampled points and rendered pixels needed for each viewpoint, accelerating rendering.

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework that combines low-resolution volume rendering with high-resolution neural rendering guided by preceding frames. The core ideas are:

- Render a low-resolution feature map via volume rendering, reducing computation.

- Further accelerate this by limiting sampling range using reprojected depths from preceding frames. 

- Recover a high-res output image using a lightweight neural renderer taking preceding and current feature maps.

- Jointly train the feature fields and neural renderer end-to-end.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by fully exploiting smooth viewpoint changes in this way, NeRF rendering can be significantly accelerated while maintaining high image fidelity and low memory overhead.
