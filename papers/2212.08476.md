# [SteerNeRF: Accelerating NeRF Rendering via Smooth Viewpoint Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08476)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we accelerate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) rendering by exploiting the typically smooth viewpoint trajectory during interactive viewpoint control?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The viewpoint trajectory is usually smooth and continuous during interactive viewpoint control. 

2) This smooth trajectory means there is significant information overlap between consecutive viewpoints.

3) By exploiting this, we can reduce the number of sampled points and rendered pixels needed for each viewpoint, accelerating rendering.

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework that combines low-resolution volume rendering with high-resolution neural rendering guided by preceding frames. The core ideas are:

- Render a low-resolution feature map via volume rendering, reducing computation.

- Further accelerate this by limiting sampling range using reprojected depths from preceding frames. 

- Recover a high-res output image using a lightweight neural renderer taking preceding and current feature maps.

- Jointly train the feature fields and neural renderer end-to-end.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by fully exploiting smooth viewpoint changes in this way, NeRF rendering can be significantly accelerated while maintaining high image fidelity and low memory overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Providing a new perspective on accelerating NeRF rendering by exploiting smooth viewpoint trajectories during interactive viewpoint control. 

- Proposing a framework that combines low-resolution volume rendering with high-resolution neural rendering to leverage information from preceding viewpoints and reduce overall rendering time.

- Demonstrating that joint training of the neural feature fields and neural renderer is important for achieving high image fidelity with this framework.

- Achieving fast rendering speeds of nearly 100 FPS at 800x800 resolution and 30 FPS at 1920x1080 resolution with relatively low memory footprint, compared to prior NeRF acceleration methods.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be speeding up NeRF rendering in a way that is complementary to existing methods, by utilizing the assumption of smooth viewpoint changes to share information across frames and reduce computations. The proposed framework and training approach allow for accelerating both the number of sampling points and number of rendered pixels while maintaining quality.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural radiance fields (NeRF):

- The key idea in this paper of exploiting smooth viewpoint trajectories to accelerate NeRF rendering is quite novel. Most prior work on accelerating NeRF has focused on caching/precomputing radiance field samples or using smaller MLP networks. This paper introduces a new orthogonal direction by leveraging temporal coherence across viewpoints.

- The proposed approach of combining low-resolution volume rendering with a lightweight neural renderer is simple and effective. The hybrid volumetric and image-based rendering pipeline is intuitive, but surprisingly this direction has not been extensively explored for NeRF rendering. 

- The performance gains are quite significant - up to 30 FPS at 1080p resolution with reasonable quality. This narrows the gap between cached/tabulated NeRF methods that require large memory, versus other lightweight approaches that are slower.

- The method is compatible with other NeRF representations and acceleration techniques. For example, it demonstrates gains even when combined with Instant-NGP, which uses hash table lookups to accelerate sampling. So it can potentially combine well with other caching schemes too.

- Compared to concurrent work like R2L2 [1] which also uses a 2D CNN to accelerate rendering, this method better handles novel view synthesis by leveraging multiple viewpoints. The joint training approach also seems more robust.

Overall, the idea of using temporal coherence for NeRF acceleration is novel, the proposed approach is intuitive yet effective, and the results demonstrate significant gains over prior work on lightweight NeRF rendering. The method also combines well with existing acceleration techniques. The results are quite compelling and this should inspire more work on exploiting temporal coherence for neural rendering.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing neural renderers that generalize well to new scenes with little or no fine-tuning. The current approach requires training a custom neural renderer from scratch for each scene. Research into more generalizable neural renderer architectures could reduce this training cost.

- Accelerating the training process for the 2D neural renderer. The end-to-end joint training for the neural feature fields and neural renderer can be quite time consuming. More efficient training methods could help improve practicality.

- Exploring alternatives to the simple warping method for aligning preceding frames to the current view. More advanced view synthesis or novel view generation techniques may further improve quality.

- Combining the proposed approach with other NeRF acceleration methods like caching/tabulation for potentially greater speedups. The complementary benefits of reducing pixel count/samples and computation per sample could be investigated.

- Adapting the method for video capture scenarios with complex dynamics where viewpoints change rapidly. The current approach assumes smooth viewpoint changes.

- Investigating the use of aproaches like this for tasks beyond novel view synthesis like free viewpoint video and virtual/augmented reality.

In summary, the key directions are improving generalization, faster training, advancing the view synthesis components, integration with other acceleration techniques, and extending to dynamic scenes and new applications. Reducing the need for per-scene optimization would be valuable future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method to accelerate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) rendering by leveraging the assumption of smooth viewpoint trajectories during interactive control. The key idea is to combine low-resolution volume rendering with high-resolution neural rendering to reduce computation while maintaining image quality. Specifically, the method renders a low-resolution feature map and depth via volume rendering, with sampling acceleration using depth from preceding frames. These are combined with preceding warped high-res features in a lightweight neural renderer to output the final high-res image. Experiments demonstrate the method achieves real-time 1080p rendering at 30 FPS with low memory overhead. The method provides a new perspective for accelerating NeRF rendering complementary to prior work, enabling fast high-res rendering with a small memory footprint. Key contributions are the efficient volume rendering, neural rendering framework leveraging preceding frames, and joint training strategy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents SteerNeRF, a method to accelerate the rendering process of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for novel view synthesis. The key idea is to leverage the assumption that viewpoint trajectories are typically smooth and continuous during interactive viewpoint control. Instead of speeding up the rendering of each individual viewpoint like previous work, SteerNeRF exploits information overlap across multiple consecutive viewpoints to reduce rendering time. 

Specifically, SteerNeRF first renders a low-resolution feature map using volume rendering with a reduced number of sample points guided by a rendering buffer containing preceding views. It then combines this current low-resolution feature map with warped preceding high-resolution features to recover the final high-resolution image using an efficient 2D neural renderer. Experiments demonstrate that SteerNeRF achieves a 3x speedup over prior work on a real-world dataset while maintaining high visual quality. The method enables 30 FPS rendering at 1080p resolution with only around 30MB of memory overhead. SteerNeRF provides a new perspective for accelerating NeRF rendering that is orthogonal to prior work, and could be combined with existing caching techniques to further push the efficiency-memory trade-off frontier.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new perspective to accelerate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) rendering by exploiting smooth viewpoint trajectories during interactive control. The key idea is to combine low-resolution volume rendering with high-resolution 2D neural rendering aided by preceding frames. Specifically, the method first renders a low-resolution feature map via volume rendering using a neural feature field network. The sampling range is reduced by warping and projecting preceding depth maps to the current view. Next, a lightweight 2D convolutional neural network takes the preceding and current low-resolution feature maps as input to recover the output image at full resolution. By performing the costly volume rendering at low-resolution and using efficient 2D rendering guided by preceding frames, the overall rendering is accelerated. The neural feature field network and 2D renderer are trained end-to-end, enabling high fidelity novel view synthesis at low computational and memory cost.
