# [CM3: A Causal Masked Multimodal Model of the Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07520)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces \HTLiM{}, a new family of causally masked generative models trained on a large corpus of multi-modal documents containing both text and images. The key innovation is a causally masked training objective that generates most tokens left-to-right like a standard language model, but also masks out and infills longer spans to enable bidirectional context, similar to a masked language model. \HTLiM{} models are trained on simplified HTML documents from Common Crawl news and Wikipedia, extended to include discrete VQVAE image tokens representing the images. The resulting 2.7B and 13B parameter \HTLiM{} models demonstrate strong zero-shot performance on a wide range of text, image, and cross-modal tasks, including image generation, summarization, entity linking, and more. Without any fine-tuning, \HTLiM{} sets new state-of-the-art results on several zero-shot benchmarks. Additional experiments demonstrate \HTLiM{} representations are still highly effective for fine-tuning on GLUE, further improving state-of-the-art for entity linking/disambiguation when fine-tuned on those tasks specifically. The work highlights the versatility of large causally masked multimodal models to unify diverse capabilities within a single model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 \HTLiM{} introduces a new causally masked language model trained on a large corpus of multimodal documents containing text, images, and document structure that achieves strong performance on a diverse range of language and vision tasks through zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of \HTLiM{}, a family of causally masked generative models trained on a large corpus of structured multi-modal documents containing both text and images.

2) The proposal of a new "causally masked" language modeling objective, which is a hybrid of causal and masked language modeling. It enables full generative modeling while also providing bidirectional context when generating masked spans.

3) Demonstrating that the \HTLiM{} models can perform a wide range of uni- and cross-modal tasks in a zero-shot fashion, including image generation, captioning, summarization, entity linking and disambiguation. The model is shown to recover the functionality of other models like DALL-E, GENRE, and \HTLM{} through prompting.

4) Showing state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on summarization and entity tasks by utilizing the document structure from training. Also showing competitive performance on GLUE benchmarks when fine-tuned.

5) Releasing all code and models to support future research on \HTLiM{}.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting \HTLiM{}, a multi-modal causally masked model trained on a large corpus of web documents, which achieves strong zero-shot and fine-tuned performance on a diverse set of language and vision tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new "causally masked" objective that combines causal language modeling with masking. Can you explain in more detail how this objective works and the benefits it provides over standard causal language modeling?

2. The paper trains models on simplified HTML documents containing text, images, and links. Can you discuss the process used to extract and simplify HTML documents from Common Crawl and Wikipedia? What challenges did this present compared to using clean text corpora?

3. The paper tokenizes images using VQVAE-GAN. What is VQVAE-GAN and why was it chosen over other image tokenization methods? What are the tradeoffs of using a discrete tokenized representation for images?

4. The paper finds that size hints degraded performance, contrary to findings in previous work. Why do you think size hints were not beneficial for the causally masked objective and multimodal modeling? 

5. Can you analyze the scaling laws presented for the causally masked objective compared to standard causal language modeling? What differences arise from modeling images and document structure?

6. The model shows strong zero-shot performance on tasks like entity disambiguation. Can you explain the prompted entity disambiguation approach in more detail? Why does the HTML structure provide benefits?

7. For image generation tasks, how does the model qualitatively compare to DALL-E? What differences arise from the model architecture and training data choices?

8. The model sets new SOTA on several zero-shot summarization benchmarks. To what extent do you think the model has learned to genuinely summarize versusexploit biases/heuristics on these datasets?

9. For fine-tuning tasks like GLUE, how competitive is the model compared to similarly sized Transformer models? Where does it underperform and why?

10. The paper analyzes gender/racial bias using GWEAT/GSEAT. How does the model compare to other multimodal models in terms of social biases? What factors contribute to these results?
