# [OSSAR: Towards Open-Set Surgical Activity Recognition in Robot-assisted   Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06985)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Surgical activity recognition (SAR) algorithms rely on pre-defined closed sets of activities and fail when presented with new unseen activities (open set problem). This is an issue as new surgical procedures and activities continue to emerge in real-world scenarios.

- Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods struggle when the differences between known and unknown classes are small, often misclassifying unknowns as knowns due to overconfidence in predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an Open-Set Surgical Activity Recognition (OSSAR) framework to address open set challenges in SAR. 

- A Hyperspherical Reciprocal Points (HSRP) strategy is used to push representations of unknown classes away from known classes in feature space. This enhances separation between subtle representations of surgical activities.  

- A Closed-set Over-confidence Calibration (COC) module penalizes the model if confidence in predicting known classes is too high. This prevents unknowns being wrongly classified as knowns.

Contributions:
- Construction of an open set SAR benchmark using the public JIGSAWS dataset with unseen surgical activity classes.

- Introduction of a new surgical activity dataset on endoscopic submucosal dissection containing known and unseen classes.  

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance of the proposed OSSAR framework on the two datasets through comparisons and ablation studies. Significantly improved detection of unknown surgical activities.

- The solutions specifically address challenges of open set recognition in surgical scenarios and advance progress towards real-world automated surgery systems.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative open set recognition framework tailored for surgical activity analysis. Evaluations verify improved generalization capabilities in identifying both known and previously unseen surgical activity classes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an Open-Set Surgical Activity Recognition (OSSAR) framework with a Hyperspherical Reciprocal Points (HSRP) strategy and a Closed-set Over-confidence Calibration (COC) module to effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in robotic surgery scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents a new open-set surgical activity recognition (OSSAR) framework to address the challenges of real-world surgical scenarios where test samples may come from unseen classes not encountered during training. 

2. It proposes two key components: (i) The Hyperspherical Reciprocal Points (HSRP) strategy to learn discriminative features on a hypersphere space to better distinguish between known and unknown classes. (ii) The Closed-set Over-confidence Calibration (COC) module to mitigate misclassification issues by penalizing the model's over-confidence on known classes.

3. It establishes benchmark setups for open-set surgical activity recognition on two datasets: the public JIGSAWS dataset and a novel dual-arm robotic surgery dataset on endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).  

4. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on open-set recognition metrics. This showcases the capability of the method to accurately classify known activities while detecting unknown activities.

In summary, the main contribution is an innovative open-set recognition framework tailored for surgical activity recognition to handle unseen classes, consisting of novel strategies for feature discrimination and confidence calibration. The benchmark setups and extensive evaluations further verify its effectiveness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Hyperspherical Reciprocal Point (HSRP) strategy. Can you explain in detail the intuition and formulation behind using the angular distance on a hypersphere for computing distances between features? What are the benefits compared to using Euclidean distances?

2. The paper incorporates a Closed-set Over-confidence Calibration (COC) module that penalizes the model when it is over-confident in its predictions for known classes. Can you walk through how this module is formulated, especially the use of the constraint threshold Î¸? How does adding this penalty term help improve open-set recognition performance?  

3. The paper evaluates performance using accuracy, AUROC, and OSCR metrics. Can you explain what each of these metrics captures and why they were chosen as evaluation criteria? What are the limitations of relying solely on these metrics?

4. How exactly were the JIGSAWS and DREAMS datasets adapted into an open-set benchmark? What fraction of classes were held out as unknown classes? Does the choice of which classes to hold out impact reported performance in your opinion?

5. The paper compares against several state-of-the-art open-set recognition techniques. Can you summarize 1-2 of these techniques and explain their key ideas/formulations? What are their limitations that this paper aims to address?  

6. In the ablation study, the impact of the COC and HSRP modules is analyzed. What drop in performance is witnessed when either of these components is removed? What does this convey about their contribution?

7. The paper studies the impact of using different distance metrics in the adversarial margin constraint loss term. Which metric worked best and why might that be the case? How does the performance change with other metrics like angular or Manhattan distances?

8. What is the significance of calibrating closed-set performance in improving open-set recognition capabilities according to this paper? Do you think a similar relationship holds for other application domains?

9. The paper mentions some limitations around not fully capitalizing on the hypersphere geometry. What specific limitations are outlined and how can they be potentially addressed in future work?

10. Given the risk level involved in surgical situations, would you say the accuracy levels reported in this paper are sufficient for real-world deployment? What further improvements would be required before this technique can be deployed in robotic surgery systems?
