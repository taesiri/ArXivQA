# [All You Need Is Hashing: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attack in   Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to defend against data reconstruction attacks in vertical federated learning (VFL) using hashing. The key points are:- Existing VFL frameworks using homomorphic encryption are insufficient to prevent data reconstruction attacks, where adversaries can reconstruct raw data from intermediate representations. This is due to the powerful approximation capabilities of deep neural networks.- The paper proposes a hashing-based VFL framework called HashVFL to address this problem. Hashing can cut off the reversibility and prevent attempts to recover data from hash codes.- However, integrating hashing also introduces challenges around learnability, bit balance, and consistency. The paper proposes solutions to these challenges.- Learnability: Use straight-through estimator (STE) to allow gradients to pass through the hash function and continue model training.- Bit balance: Use batch normalization to balance the distribution of each bit in the limited code length. - Consistency: Compare hash codes to pre-defined binary codes rather than pair-wise between parties to reduce computation overhead.- Experiments show HashVFL maintains task performance across data types while defending against reconstruction attacks. It also helps detect abnormal inputs based on consistency.In summary, the central research question is how hashing can be used to prevent data reconstruction attacks in VFL, while addressing key challenges around integrating hashing into the VFL framework.
