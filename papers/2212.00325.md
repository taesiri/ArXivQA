# [All You Need Is Hashing: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attack in   Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to defend against data reconstruction attacks in vertical federated learning (VFL) using hashing. The key points are:- Existing VFL frameworks using homomorphic encryption are insufficient to prevent data reconstruction attacks, where adversaries can reconstruct raw data from intermediate representations. This is due to the powerful approximation capabilities of deep neural networks.- The paper proposes a hashing-based VFL framework called HashVFL to address this problem. Hashing can cut off the reversibility and prevent attempts to recover data from hash codes.- However, integrating hashing also introduces challenges around learnability, bit balance, and consistency. The paper proposes solutions to these challenges.- Learnability: Use straight-through estimator (STE) to allow gradients to pass through the hash function and continue model training.- Bit balance: Use batch normalization to balance the distribution of each bit in the limited code length. - Consistency: Compare hash codes to pre-defined binary codes rather than pair-wise between parties to reduce computation overhead.- Experiments show HashVFL maintains task performance across data types while defending against reconstruction attacks. It also helps detect abnormal inputs based on consistency.In summary, the central research question is how hashing can be used to prevent data reconstruction attacks in VFL, while addressing key challenges around integrating hashing into the VFL framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new hashing-based vertical federated learning (VFL) framework called HashVFL to defend against data reconstruction attacks in VFL. This is the first work to integrate hashing into VFL for privacy protection.2. It identifies three key challenges in integrating hashing into VFL - learnability, bit balance, and consistency. The paper provides solutions to address each of these challenges:- Learnability: Use a sign function and straight-through estimator (STE) to allow gradients to flow through the hash layer. This allows training to continue despite the gradient vanishing problem caused by hashing.- Bit balance: Add a batch normalization layer before hashing to balance the distribution of each bit. This maximizes the usage of each bit in the limited hash code length. - Consistency: Compare hash codes to pre-defined class-specific binary codes to enforce consistency across parties and enable detection of abnormal inputs.3. It conducts comprehensive experiments showing HashVFL can maintain accuracy on image, text and tabular datasets, defend against reconstruction attacks, and detect abnormal inputs. The framework is robust across different model architectures, numbers of parties, hash code lengths etc.4. The paper provides the first attempt at integrating hashing into VFL to cut off reverse mapping from hashes to raw data. It identifies key challenges and solutions to make this viable. The authors hope this will open up new research directions for privacy protection in VFL.In summary, the main contribution is proposing HashVFL, a novel hashing-based framework to defend against reconstruction attacks in VFL while maintaining utility. The paper addresses key technical challenges in integrating hashing into VFL.
