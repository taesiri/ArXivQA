# [Expert Composer Policy: Scalable Skill Repertoire for Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for combining multiple locomotion skills in legged robots have limitations: hierarchical architectures require retraining when adding new skills which degrades motion quality; transition methods based on instant switches fail for skills with distinct motions. There is a need for an expandable repertoire framework that can incrementally add new skills while preserving motion quality.

Proposed Solution: 
- Train a library of independent single-skill expert policies using motion imitation in physics simulation.
- Develop a composer policy that generates smooth transition trajectories between arbitrary agent states. It is trained separately via reinforcement learning to drive the agent from any start state to a random target state. 
- Enable transitioning between skills by having the composer policy sample a target state from the next desired skill, then generate actions to reach that target state, allowing the switch between policies.

Key Contributions:
- A composer policy with shrinking action boundaries that generates smooth transitions between arbitrary agent states.
- A skill repertoire expansion framework where new skills can be added without retraining existing experts or the composer, enabling incremental expansion.
- Experiments with 9 skills and 72 transitions pairs, where composer policy achieved 99.99% success rate in simulation and 97.22% in the real world, outperforming prior skill transition methods.

Overall, the paper proposes a novel transition mechanism and composer policy to enable online, real-time transitions between distinct skills learned independently. By reusing the single composer policy, new skills can be added without affecting existing ones, providing an incremental skill repertoire expansion approach.
