# [cedar: Composable and Optimized Machine Learning Input Data Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning (ML) models require high-throughput input data pipelines to continuously preprocess raw data into samples during training. As models become larger and more data-hungry, input data demands have skyrocketed.
- Current input data systems like TensorFlow's tf.data and PyTorch's DataLoader struggle to meet these demands efficiently. They fail to fully capitalize on and automate the complex set of optimizations (e.g. caching, fusion, reordering) needed.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Cedar, a new programming model and framework for building, optimizing and executing ML input data pipelines. 
- It provides a Python API for users to easily compose pipelines from modular operators (Pipes). Users can specify lightweight ordering hints to enable optimizations.
- Cedar models pipelines as dataflow graphs and exposes Optimization and Execution interfaces. The Optimizer leverages these to apply static graph optimizations and dynamic resource auto-tuning.
- It supports offloading pipeline execution across local or distributed backends based on their strengths. This allows combining optimizations like parallelism, fusion, caching in a unified manner.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates the need and challenges of concurrently applying complex optimizations like reordering, fusion, caching, prefetching and offloading to input data pipelines.
- Proposes the composable Cedar programming model and Optimizer for building, optimizing and executing pipelines. Supports constraints to preserve semantics of blackbox operators.
- Achieves 2.49x, 1.87x, 2.18x and 2.74x speedup over TensorFlow's tf.data, tf.data service, Ray Data and PyTorch's DataLoader across vision, NLP and speech pipelines.
- Shows Cedar can dynamically right-size resources to minimize costs while meeting target data loading throughput for training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Cedar is a composable and optimized framework for machine learning input data pipelines that allows users to easily define pipelines using modular operators, expresses hints about operator semantics to enable optimizations like reordering and caching, automatically applies techniques like offloading and fusion across local and distributed backends through its Optimizer interface, and dynamically tunes execution to meet throughput demands with minimal resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting Cedar, a composable and optimized framework for defining, optimizing, and executing machine learning input data pipelines. Specifically:

- Cedar provides a Python API (\texttt{Feature} API) that allows users to easily define input data pipelines by chaining together modular operators (\texttt{Pipes}), and express hints to preserve semantic correctness under optimizations.

- Cedar models pipelines as dataflow graphs and exposes optimization and execution interfaces. This allows Cedar's \texttt{Optimizer} to transparently apply a range of optimizations (e.g. reordering, fusion, caching) and execute pipelines across local and distributed backends.

- Evaluations on diverse CV, NLP, and speech pipelines show Cedar can significantly outperform existing input data systems like tf.data, tf.data service, Ray Data, and PyTorch DataLoaders. On average Cedar achieves 2.49x, 1.87x, 2.18x, and 2.74x speedups respectively.

In summary, the main contribution is the Cedar framework itself, which provides a way to easily build, optimize, and execute high-performance machine learning input data pipelines across diverse workloads.
