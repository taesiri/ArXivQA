# [Gaze-guided Hand-Object Interaction Synthesis: Benchmark and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Gaze plays an important role in revealing human attention and intention during hand-object interactions, but there is a lack of datasets capturing the relationship between gaze, hands and objects. 
- Synthesizing natural gaze-guided hand-object interactions is challenging due to the complexity of modeling interactions between hands and objects conditioned on gaze.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces GazeHOI, the first dataset focused on gaze-guided hand-object interactions, with simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hands and objects during interactions.
- Proposes GHO-Diffusion, a hierarchical framework to synthesize gaze-guided hand-object interactions.
    - In the pre-diffusion phase, gaze conditions are separated into spatial-temporal features and goal pose conditions. 
    - In the diffusion phase, object motions are generated conditioned on gaze features first. Then hand motions are generated based on the object motions and goal pose. A spherical Gaussian constraint is introduced to guide the hand motion generation.
    - In the post-diffusion phase, contact consistency optimization is applied to refine the hand motions.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset (GazeHOI) dedicated to gaze-guided hand-object interactions, with rich annotations.
- Novel task formulation and method (GHO-Diffusion) for synthesizing natural gaze-guided hand-object interactions.
- Innovative techniques like spherical Gaussian constraint and contact consistency optimization to improve goal pose alignment and motion realism.
- Extensive experiments validating the dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach over baselines.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in terms of the dataset, task formulation, and model design for gaze-guided hand-object interaction synthesis.
