# [BEVFormer v2: Adapting Modern Image Backbones to Bird's-Eye-View   Recognition via Perspective Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10439)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: 

How can modern image backbones be effectively adapted and unleashed for bird's-eye-view (BEV) recognition models without cumbersome depth pre-training or 3D pre-training?

The key points seem to be:

- Existing BEV recognition models rely on depth pre-trained backbones like VoVNet, limiting exploration of more modern image backbones. 

- The authors hypothesize that with proper perspective supervision, modern image backbones can be readily adapted to BEV models without 3D pre-training.

- They propose a two-stage BEV detector BEVFormer v2 with perspective supervision to address this question.

- Perspective supervision is provided by an auxiliary 3D detection loss from a perspective view detection head. This guides the backbone to learn useful 3D properties.

- The perspective head also generates first-stage proposals to ease optimization of the BEV head.

- Experiments show BEVFormer v2 effectively unleashes modern backbones for BEV recognition, outperforming prior state-of-the-art without depth pre-training.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that perspective supervision can enable modern image backbones to be readily adapted for BEV recognition without cumbersome 3D pre-training. The proposed BEVFormer v2 method is used to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Pointing out that perspective supervision is key to adapting general 2D image backbones to BEV models. They add this supervision explicitly through a detection loss in the perspective view.

2. Presenting a novel two-stage BEV detector, BEVFormer v2, which consists of a perspective 3D detection head and a BEV detection head. The proposals from the perspective head are combined with the learned object queries in the BEV head. 

3. Showing the effectiveness of their approach by combining it with latest image backbones like ConvNeXt and Internorm and achieving significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing perspective supervision to facilitate adapting modern image backbones to BEV models, which is realized by adding an auxiliary perspective detection head and integrating it with the BEV head in a two-stage framework. This allows them to unlock the potential of advanced image backbones for BEV recognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes BEVFormer v2, a novel two-stage bird's-eye-view object detector for autonomous driving that incorporates perspective-view supervision to facilitate optimizing modern image backbones without cumbersome depth pre-training, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on bird's-eye view object detection:

- Focus on image backbone adaptation: Most prior work has focused on designing and improving the BEV detector architectures. This paper instead focuses on adapting modern image classification backbones like ConvNeXt and Intern to BEV detection, which is relatively underexplored.

- Perspective supervision: The key idea proposed is adding an auxiliary perspective detection head and loss to facilitate optimization and adaptation of image backbones. This differs from prior approaches like using depth pre-training. 

- Achieves new SOTA results: By using the proposed perspective supervision and large backbones like InternImage, this paper achieves new state-of-the-art results on nuScenes, surpassing prior work by a significant margin. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ideas.

- Generalizable approach: The benefits of perspective supervision are shown across a range of backbones like ResNet, DLA, VoVNet, and InternImage. This suggests it is a generally useful technique, not just tied to specific architectures.

- Two-stage BEV detector: The integration of perspective and BEV detection heads into a two-stage model is novel for BEV detection. Most prior work has focused on single-stage detectors.

Overall, the key novelties are the use of perspective supervision to facilitate image backbone adaptation, and the resulting significant improvements in BEV detection accuracy from using modern classification backbones. The generalizable improvements suggest this is a promising direction for future research on optimizing BEV detectors.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore better image backbone designs for BEV models. The authors' method allows modern 2D image backbones to be adapted for BEV recognition without cumbersome pre-training. This opens up possibilities to explore newer and better image backbone architectures specialized for BEV models.

- Test the method on larger-scale image backbones. Due to computational constraints, the authors were only able to experiment with certain backbone sizes. They suggest extending the experiments to larger backbones.

- Explore other choices for the perspective and BEV heads used in the two-stage detector. The authors tested some options but there could be other head designs that work even better. 

- Apply the perspective supervision idea to other BEV detectors besides BEVFormer. The authors propose that perspective supervision can be a general scheme for training many types of BEV models.

- Explore other forms of auxiliary supervision besides the perspective loss. The key insight is that direct dense supervision on image features helps optimize BEV models. Other types of auxiliary losses could be studied.

- Extend the method for online 3D detection settings. The paper focuses on offline 3D detection where future frames are available. Adapting the idea for online prediction can be an interesting direction.

In summary, the key suggestions are around exploring better backbone architectures, applying the idea to other BEV detectors, and investigating other forms of direct dense supervision for image features. The authors propose their method provides a foundation for much follow-up research in adapting image backbones for BEV recognition.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents BEVFormer v2, a novel bird's-eye-view (BEV) detector that adapts modern image backbones to BEV recognition via perspective supervision. The key ideas are:

- Introducing perspective supervision by adding an auxiliary perspective 3D detection head upon the image backbone, which provides direct and dense supervision to guide the backbone adapting to 3D scenes. 

- Integrating the perspective head and the BEV head into a two-stage detector. The perspective head generates first-stage proposals which are encoded as object queries and combined with learned queries to feed into the second-stage BEV head for final detection. 

- Achieving new state-of-the-art results on nuScenes dataset by unleashing modern image backbones like InternImage, demonstrating the effectiveness of perspective supervision for adapting 2D backbones to BEV models.

The core contribution is facilitating the optimization of BEV detectors with perspective supervision so that large-scale image backbones pre-trained on 2D tasks can be readily adapted to BEV recognition without cumbersome 3D pre-training. This unlocks the potential of exploring better backbone designs for BEV models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents BEVFormer v2, a novel bird's-eye-view (BEV) object detector for autonomous driving applications. It focuses on adapting modern image classification backbones, like ConvNeXt and InternImage, to BEV detection without requiring cumbersome depth pretraining. 

The key idea is to introduce an auxiliary perspective view detection head that provides direct supervision on image features, overcoming issues with only BEV supervision being indirect and sparse.

BEVFormer v2 integrates this perspective head with the BEV head in a two-stage detector, using perspective view proposals to guide BEV detection. Experiments show BEVFormer v2 effectively adapts various backbones and achieves new state-of-the-art results on nuScenes, demonstrating the benefit of perspective supervision for integrating modern image backbones into BEV detection. Core contributions are perspective supervision, a two-stage detector architecture, and benchmark results from combining strong image backbones with BEV detection.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel two-stage bird's-eye-view (BEV) object detector called BEVFormer v2. The key idea is to introduce perspective supervision to help adapt modern image backbones for BEV recognition. 

Specifically, the method adds an auxiliary perspective 3D detection head upon the backbone to provide direct and dense supervision to image features. This facilitates optimizing large image backbones for perceiving 3D scenes. 

In addition, it integrates the perspective head and the original BEV head into a two-stage pipeline, where proposals from the perspective view are encoded as object queries and combined with learned queries to improve BEV detection.

Experiments show that with the help of perspective supervision, the method successfully unleashes the power of modern image backbones and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The main problem this paper addresses is adapting modern image backbones to bird's-eye-view (BEV) recognition models for autonomous driving applications. Specifically, it focuses on the following key aspects:

- Existing BEV detectors are often restricted to certain depth pre-trained backbones like VoVNet, which hinders utilizing more advanced image backbones. The paper aims to unleash the power of modern image backbones for BEV recognition.

- Simply using latest image backbones like ConvNeXt pretrained on ImageNet performs poorly on BEV detection tasks. The paper examines why adapting these backbones is difficult and proposes solutions. 

- The supervision signals from the BEV detection head are indirect and sparse for the image backbone. The paper introduces perspective supervision to guide the backbone explicitly.

- Current BEV detectors have complex structures with stacked transformer layers, which distorts the gradient flow from loss signals. The perspective supervision provides direct dense supervisions to facilitate optimization.

- The paper integrates perspective and BEV detection heads into a two-stage detector to further improve performance. The perspective proposals are encoded as queries for the BEV head.

In summary, the key focus is unleashing the potential of modern image backbones for BEV recognition by introducing perspective supervision and constructed a two-stage detector BEVFormer v2. Experiments verify the effectiveness on nuScenes dataset and achieve new state-of-the-art results.
