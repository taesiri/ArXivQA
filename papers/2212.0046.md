# [Feature Selection with Distance Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.0046)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we efficiently select a small set of physically interpretable high-level features (EFPs) that can achieve competitive classification performance compared to complex deep learning models? The key ideas and methods proposed to address this question include:- Developing a new forward feature selection algorithm based on distance correlation (DisCo-FFS) to iteratively select the most relevant EFPs. - Using distance correlation as a measure of statistical dependence between a set of candidate features and the classifier output/truth labels, in order to quantify feature relevance.- Applying DisCo-FFS to top tagging, starting from an initial set of over 7,000 EFPs. - Demonstrating that a small set of <10 EFPs selected by DisCo-FFS can match the performance of much larger and complex models like ParticleNet-Lite, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.- Comparing DisCo-FFS to a previous feature selection method (DO-ADO-FFS) and showing improved performance.- Analyzing the selected EFPs to gain physics insights into what features are most useful for top tagging.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a small set of interpretible high-level jet substructure features (EFPs) can be efficiently found using DisCo-FFS that can match larger deep learning models, providing physics insights. The results seem to validate this hypothesis.
