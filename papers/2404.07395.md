# [Global versus Local: Evaluating AlexNet Architectures for Tropical   Cyclone Intensity Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating tropical cyclone intensity is critical for disaster management. Existing methods either rely on subjective expert analysis of cloud patterns or complex deep learning models lacking explainability. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces two ensemble-based AlexNet models to estimate tropical cyclone intensity from visible satellite images.

- The global model is trained on the full dataset. The distributed model has separate AlexNets trained on wind speed ranges as per the Saffir-Simpson scale. The final prediction is the average of the global and appropriate local model.

Main Contributions:

- Both models outperform existing benchmark with lower RMSE on a public dataset. The global and distributed models achieve 9.03 and 9.3 knots RMSE compared to 13.62 for benchmark.

- Handles data imbalance by removing temporal correlation, wind speed bias, and event bias when creating training batches. Augments data as well.

- Provides explainability by visually showing connection between grad-CAM patterns and cloud structures described in classic Dvorak technique. Heatmaps focus on cyclone eye at high wind speeds.

- The distributed model is inspired by Mixture of Experts concept with global model as router and local models as experts. Allows easy incorporation of multi-channel data.

- Clearly explains data preprocessing, model development, tackling overfitting and evaluation to facilitate future research.

In summary, the paper presents interpretable tropical cyclone intensity estimation models that leverage ensembles of AlexNets and outperform existing methods. The solution strategy is methodical and reproducible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces two ensemble-based AlexNet models for tropical cyclone intensity estimation from visible satellite images, which outperform existing benchmark methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of two ensemble-based models utilizing the AlexNet architecture to estimate tropical cyclone intensity from visible satellite images:

1) A "global" AlexNet model trained on the entire dataset. 

2) A "distributed" model with multiple AlexNet instances trained on subsets of data categorized by the Saffir-Simpson wind speed scale. 

The key highlights stated in the paper are:

- Novelty: The distributed AlexNet architecture uses a two-step regression approach, distinguishing it from existing data-driven models.

- Explainability: The models are explained by showing a connection between the grad-CAM patterns and cloud structures in Dvorak's empirical model. 

- Performance: Both the global and distributed models outperform the benchmark Deepti model on the public cyclone image dataset, with RMSE scores of 9.03 and 9.3 knots respectively versus 13.62 for Deepti.

So in summary, the main contribution is the introduction and evaluation of the global and distributed AlexNet-based models for cyclone intensity estimation, which demonstrate improved performance over existing methods.
