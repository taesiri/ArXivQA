# [Applying ranking techniques for estimating influence of Earth variables   on temperature forecast error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper builds on previous research that explored correlations between earth system variables (ecological, hydrological, meteorological) and temperature forecast errors from a global weather model. 
- The limitations of the previous approach were that many variables did not reach statistical significance thresholds, so their values were discarded from analysis. 
- This paper aims to propose a more robust methodology to analyze the influence of variables on forecast error that does not discard potentially useful information.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a machine learning approach focused on specific locations, rather than global dataset.
- Convert correlation values into rankings using Spearman, Pearson and Kendall correlations. 
- Aggregate rankings into a more robust overall ranking using Borda count technique.
- Evaluate methodology by learning Random Forest regression models with ranked variable subsets.

Experiments:
- 5 locations across different continents chosen based on potential for forecast improvement.
- Compare RMSE using top k ranked variables vs all variables, for k = 5 to 25.
- Also compare to RMSE from variables chosen by Random Forest feature importance.
- Evaluate with both Random Forest and Bayesian Ridge regression models.

Key Results:
- Ranking-based selection works well for feature selection. 
- Performance depends on location and season as expected.  
- Simpler Bayesian Ridge model generalizes better than Random Forest.
- Good performance achieved with top 10-20 variables based on aggregated ranking.
- Concordance between correlation metrics provides insight into performance.

Main Contributions:  
- Framework to convert correlations into rankings and combine into an aggregated ranking
- Demonstrated application for robust variable selection using five use cases
- Promising technique for this problem and methodology could be applied to other domains


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework to analyze the influence of Earth system variables on temperature forecast errors by converting variable correlations into rankings, aggregating them into a robust ranking, and evaluating performance using Random Forest regression models on selected locations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework that generates a robust ranking of earth system variables based on their influence on temperature forecast errors. The key aspects of this framework are:

1) Applying multiple correlation metrics (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) to create rankings of the variables with respect to the forecast error. 

2) Aggregating these distinct rankings into a consensus ranking using the Borda count technique. This ensemble approach aims to leverage the strengths of each individual ranking.

3) Evaluating the usefulness of this aggregated ranking by selecting the top k variables and measuring the performance of machine learning models (Random Forest and Bayesian Regression) trained on those subsets. 

4) Demonstrating this methodology on five locations across distinct continents and seasons. The results show that the ranking-based selection works well, achieving errors close to just using all variables, hence successfully determining a relevant subset of variables.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an analysis framework to robustly identify influential variables for the temperature forecast error, converting correlation metrics into rankings and then into a combined ranking, evaluating via model learning. The paper also discusses insights, limitations and future work possibilities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an ensemble ranking approach to select the most influential variables. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an ensemble ranking compared to selecting variables based on a single correlation metric?

2. The Borda count method is used to aggregate the rankings from different correlation metrics. How does this method work and what are its limitations? Could other ranking aggregation methods like positional voting be explored?

3. The paper evaluates the ensemble ranking approach by learning Random Forest and Bayesian Ridge regression models. Why are these models chosen and what are their key strengths and weaknesses for this application?

4. Overfitting is identified as an issue when using Random Forest models on the small datasets in this study. What techniques could be used to reduce overfitting of the Random Forest models?

5. The paper analyzes the performance using the RMSE metric. What other evaluation metrics could be relevant for this forecasting task? What are the tradeoffs of using different performance metrics?  

6. The choice of k value for selecting the top k variables is analyzed. What criteria could be used to systematically select an optimal value of k for a given dataset?

7. The paper studies five geographic locations as use cases. How could the conclusions be generalized to other locations not studied? What cautions need to be exercised in generalizing the results?

8. What mechanisms in the framework help understand which variables are most relevant in different regions and seasons? How can these explanatory capabilities be improved?

9. What kind of pre-processing could be applied to handle redundancy between variables expressing similar information? What multivariate analysis techniques could help in this regard?

10. The paper focuses the analysis on average forecast errors. How could the methodology be tailored to specifically analyze and reduce extreme temperature forecast errors?
