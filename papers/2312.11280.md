# [Towards Fairness in Online Service with k Servers and its Application on   Fair Food Delivery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11280)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper introduces two new problems - the k-food problem and the fair k-food problem - which are more realistic generalizations of the well-known k-server problem. The k-server problem assumes instantaneous server movements and zero service times, limiting its applicability to real-world scenarios like food delivery, ride-sharing etc. 

The k-food problem removes these unrealistic assumptions. Each request is a 4-tuple (s, d, tb, te) comprising source and destination locations s, d, and a time window [tb, te] denoting the preparation time. A request is served if a server reaches s within [tb, te] and then moves to d. Servers now have finite speeds, making them temporarily unavailable while serving a request. The goal is to minimize total server movement.

The fair k-food problem has the same setting but assumes a max-min fairness objective to maximize the minimum reward earned by any server, motivated by the need to ensure livable earnings for gig workers in online platforms.

Proposed Solution:

1. The paper shows both problems are strongly NP-hard. 

2. An optimal fractional offline algorithm FlowLP is developed for the fair k-food problem, based on forming a time-expanded flow network and solving a Mixed Integer Linear Program. To balance platform cost and fairness, a two-sided version FlowLP (2S) is also proposed.

3. For online fair food delivery, a novel algorithm Doc4Food is proposed that combines the idea of prioritizing minimum earning eligible servers from GreedyMin, with a domain-specific heuristic where idle servers virtually move towards potential future order locations.

Main Contributions:

1. Introduction of two new generalized k-server problems - k-food and fair k-food, with practical applications in food delivery, ride sharing etc. 

2. Hardness results establishing both problems are strongly NP-hard.

3. An optimal fractional offline algorithm FlowLP for the fair k-food problem, and its two-sided cost-fairness balanced version FlowLP (2S).

4. A new online algorithm Doc4Food for fair food delivery that outperforms prior food delivery algorithms on real-world datasets.

The paper provides a strong foundation for further research in areas like machine learning for online algorithms, fairness in online platforms, and deep learning for constrained optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces generalized k-server problems called k-food and fair k-food to model real-world applications like food delivery, proves they are NP-hard, develops an offline optimal fractional solution, and proposes an online algorithm for fair food delivery.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing two new problems - the kFood problem and the Fair kFood problem - which are more realistic generalizations of the classical k-server problem and can model various real-world applications like food delivery, ride sharing, etc.

2) Proving that both the kFood and Fair kFood problems are strongly NP-hard. 

3) Designing a fractional offline optimal algorithm called FlowLP for the Fair kFood problem based on a time-expanded flow network formulation.

4) Proposing an online algorithm called DocFood for fair food delivery that combines the idea of giving priority to servers with minimum current rewards with a domain-specific heuristic of making servers move closer to potential future request locations when idle.

5) Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and a real-world food delivery dataset comparing the performance of FlowLP and DocFood with other online and offline baselines in terms of feasibility, minimum reward, and cost. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing more realistic variants of the classical k-server problem, establishing their computational hardness, and designing an offline optimal and a practical online algorithm for the fair variant of the problem with experimental validation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the \kfood and \fairkfood problems as more realistic generalizations of the classical k-server problem. How do these new formulations capture real-world complexities better than previous k-server variants? What practical applications can they model that previous formulations could not?

2. The paper shows both the \kfood and \fairkfood problems are strongly NP-hard. Could you explain the reductions used in these hardness proofs? What insights do they provide about the inherent complexity of these new problems?  

3. The \flowlp formulation arises naturally from the time-expanded flow network for the \fairkfood problem. What is the intuition behind this construction? How does it elegantly capture the constraints and objectives of the problem?

4. The paper proposes adding an extra constraint in \flowlp to achieve better cost-fairness trade-off, leading to \flpsf. What is the motivation behind this modification? How does tuning the Î± parameter allow configuring this trade-off?

5. The online algorithm \docfood combines ideas from \greedyMin and a food delivery sector-specific heuristic. Could you explain this heuristic and how it is tailored to the properties of food delivery platforms?

6. How does the virtual movement of servers to potential future request locations in \docfood improve feasibility over simpler greedy approaches? What insights about food delivery guided this design?

7. The experiments demonstrate superior performance for \docfood over other online algorithms on real-world food delivery data. What key metrics reflect this? To what extent can similar ideas apply to other real-world platforms?

8. How effectively does the paper's experimental analysis utilize the food delivery dataset? What interesting features does this dataset have that lends itself well to this analysis?

9. The paper demonstrates the versatility of the \flowlp formulation to accommodate other objectives fairly easily. What modifications would be needed to model the classical min-cost k-server objective or other potential objectives?

10. What are some promising future research directions that build upon the \kfood and \fairkfood problems and the algorithmic ideas presented in this work?
