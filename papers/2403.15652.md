# [Parametric Encoding with Attention and Convolution Mitigate Spectral   Bias of Neural Partial Differential Equation Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that model various physical systems. However, vanilla physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with fully-connected layers suffer from two key issues:
1) Spectral bias - tendency to preferentially learn lower frequency components of the solution
2) Difficulty solving complex PDEs with discontinuities or high gradients

Proposed Solution - Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention Networks (PGCAN): 
- Novel architecture that leverages parametric grid-based encoding of the input space combined with convolutional layers and attention mechanisms

Key Components:
1) Grid-based encoder - Maps inputs to high-dim feature space, provides localized learning ability to capture high-freq features
2) Convolution layers - Propagate boundary information into domain, reduce overfitting, enable gradient flow
3) Attention-based decoder - Prioritizes more predictive features, handles discontinuities  

Main Contributions:
- First model to combine grid encoding, convolution layers and attention for PDE solution
- Convolution layers uniquely allow single grid resolution, reducing parameters 
- Demonstrated higher accuracy and mitigation of spectral bias across range of PDEs
- Naturally extends to higher dimensions and irregular domains
- Developed PSD-based metrics to quantify spectral bias of DNN PDE solvers

In summary, PGCAN introduces a novel architecture that leverages parametric encoding, convolution, and attention mechanisms to effectively solve a wide range of PDE systems while mitigating issues like spectral bias that challenge vanilla physics-informed neural networks. Both quantitative metrics and comparative studies demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization ability of the proposed technique.
