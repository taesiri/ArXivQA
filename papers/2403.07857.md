# [Fairness Feedback Loops: Training on Synthetic Data Amplifies Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07857)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Model-induced distribution shifts (MIDS) occur when model outputs pollute new training data over generations of models, causing issues like model collapse in generative models or unfairness feedback loops in classifiers.
- MIDS cause models to encode mistakes, biases, and unfairness into the data ecosystem.
- Practitioners lack understanding of how MIDS function and their impacts on fairness and representation. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a unified framework to track multiple co-occurring MIDS over generations of models. 
- They evaluate performance, fairness metrics, and representation of models in two settings: chains of classifiers with labels from prior models (performative prediction) and chains of generative models training on prior synthetic outputs (model collapse).
- They simulate algorithmic reparation (AR), an intentional MIDS aimed at promoting equity, through controlled sampling of training batches.

Key Contributions:
- Unified different MIDS into one framework and empirically evaluated their impacts, showing loss of accuracy, fairness, and representation over generations.
- Found that unawareness of MIDS leads to overstated accuracy and fairness. 
- Identified interactions between co-occurring MIDS - e.g. classifiers can adapt to input distribution changes from model collapse.
- Simulated AR interventions with stratified sampling to improve representation and fairness, mitigating negative MIDS effects.
- Highlighted the ability for models to cause both harm and good through intentional and unintentional impacts on the broader data ecosystem.

The paper makes an important contribution toward accountability and maintenance of model impacts over time through the introduced framework and AR perspective.
