# [Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political   Events from Text (CASE 2023): Workshop and Shared Task Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper reports on the proceedings of the 6th workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE 2023), held at the Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP) conference. 

The workshop brings together researchers working on event extraction from text across technical and social science domains. The goals are to advance text-based event extraction techniques and organize multimodal event extraction tasks.

The workshop features 7 accepted papers, 3 keynote talks, 4 shared tasks, and over 50 participants in the shared tasks.

The accepted papers cover topics like:
- Multi-granularity annotation and classification of criminal event sentences
- Identifying main vs secondary locations of protest events 
- Detecting civil unrest from noisy social media data
- Evaluating models for mapping news headlines to event knowledge graphs
- Building a semantic model and corpus for protest events in Bulgaria
- Few-shot learning for new event types
- Leveraging unused data to improve event extraction

The keynotes discuss:
- Large-scale projects using automated text processing to study social movements and public opinion
- Constructing a Bulgarian event corpus and knowledge graph 
- Applications of natural language processing for test generation, translation, and assisting autistic users

There are 4 shared tasks: 
- Multilingual protest news detection
- Geocoding battle events from social media 
- Identifying causal relations between event sentences
- Detecting hate speech in multimodal social media 

The tasks saw submissions using a variety of techniques like transformer models, traditional ML models, ensemble methods, etc. The best scores are comparable to or exceed human performance.

In summary, the workshop enables progress on a diverse set of event extraction problems and applications using advanced NLP techniques. The tasks and studies demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on real-world event data.
