# [Siamese Networks with Soft Labels for Unsupervised Lesion Detection and   Patch Pretraining on Screening Mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical images like mammograms are expensive to manually label for training deep learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown promise for learning representations from unlabeled data, but most existing SSL techniques are designed for natural images, not medical images.  

- It is uncertain if standard SSL methods can effectively learn from medical images where regions of interest often blend subtly with surrounding tissues. New SSL techniques designed specifically for properties of medical images are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a SSL method that exploits the natural symmetry of bilateral medical images, like mammograms, to teach a model to distinguish abnormal and normal samples without explicit labels. 

- They use a Siamese network architecture with two identical neural nets to encode embeddings for a bilateral image patch pair. The networks are trained to output similar embeddings for normal pairs and different embeddings for abnormal pairs containing a lesion.

- To deal with not having ground truth labels, they introduce a "soft label" derived by fitting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on the set of embedding Euclidean distances of patch pairs. The GMM separates normal and abnormal pairs in an unsupervised way.

- The Siamese model outperformed standard SSL techniques like SimCLR and BYOL on downstream mammogram patch classification tasks, demonstrating the promise of designing SSL techniques tailored for medical images.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel self-supervised learning method leveraging bilateral symmetry of medical images to distinguish abnormal lesions from normal tissues without manual labels.

- Introduces an unsupervised soft label derived from a Gaussian mixture model to replace ground truth labels during Siamese network training.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to standard SSL techniques on several mammogram patch classification benchmark tasks.

- Provides an approach to effectively learn from abundant unlabeled medical imaging data. Reduces reliance on costly expert annotations to train models.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative SSL algorithm tailored for medical images that shows significant promise and outperforms generic SSL techniques. By exploiting anatomical symmetry and mixture model derived soft labels, they are able to teach models to detect lesions without using actual ground truth labels.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to train a Siamese neural network in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled pairs of mammogram patches to distinguish abnormal from normal patches, using soft labels derived from Gaussian mixture models fitted to embedding distances, and shows this approach outperforms self-supervised methods on downstream classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new self-supervised learning method for pretraining neural networks on mammogram images. Specifically:

1) They propose using a Siamese neural network architecture trained on bilateral (left-right) mammogram patch pairs. The goal is to encode similar representations when both patches are normal, and different representations when one patch contains an abnormality.

2) To deal with the lack of labels indicating whether a patch pair is normal or abnormal, they introduce a "soft label" derived by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to the embedding distances of the patch pairs. This soft label represents the model's confidence that a given patch pair is abnormal.

3) They incorporate these soft labels into the loss function of the Siamese network to enable unsupervised pretraining. The pretrained encoders can then be used for downstream classification tasks.

4) They demonstrate that their proposed self-supervised pretraining method achieves better performance on several mammogram patch classification tasks compared to supervised pretraining baselines like SimCLR and BYOL. This includes abnormality detection, BI-RADS classification, and outcome classification.

In summary, the key innovation is an unsupervised pretraining approach for mammography using Siamese networks and soft labels to leverage the bilateral symmetry of the images. The method shows promise for learning useful representations from unlabeled mammograms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a Siamese network architecture for unsupervised lesion detection. Why is a Siamese network well-suited for this task compared to a standard convolutional neural network? What are the key advantages it provides?

2. Soft labels are derived in an unsupervised manner from the embeddings of the Siamese networks using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Why is a GMM used for this instead of k-means clustering or another clustering algorithm? What properties of the embedding distances led to choosing a GMM?

3. Two Siamese networks are trained in parallel rather than a single network. What instability issues arose from training a single Siamese network? How does using two networks and crossing their outputs help mitigate these issues?

4. The paper explores using the triplet loss as an alternative to the binary cross entropy loss with soft labels. What challenges arose in formulating the triplet loss for their unsupervised setting? Why did the triplet loss implementation prove too unstable for their application?

5. How exactly are the patch pairs formed from the bilateral mammograms? Why is a uniform grid strategy used instead of sampling patches centered on annotations or suspicious regions? What are the potential limitations of the grid approach? 

6. What data leakage issues could the patch-based dataset splits potentially cause? Why can this not be fully avoided given their proposed patch pretraining approach and need for downstream tasks?

7. The embedding projections show an ability to cluster abnormal patches but with a considerable false positive rate. What factors could be contributing to the false positives? How might the model distinguishibility be improved?

8. On the downstream tasks, why does the model perform better on clearly malignant cases versus borderline/benign cases? How could the method be adapted to improve detection of subtler, early-stage lesions?  

9. The current study focuses on patch-level tasks. What challenges do you foresee in extending this approach to full mammogram classification tasks? What modifications would need to be made?

10. What other medical imaging domains could this bilateral patch comparison approach be applicable to? What unique advantages or disadvantages would it have for CT, MRI, or other modalities?
