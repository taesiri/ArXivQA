# [C3: High-performance and low-complexity neural compression from a single   image or video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02753)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces C3, a neural image and video compression method that overfits a small model to each instance, achieving state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance among overfitted codecs while requiring very low decoding complexity. C3 builds on prior work COOL-CHIC and makes several improvements including better approximation of quantization during training and more expressive network architectures. On the CLIC2020 image benchmark, C3 matches the performance of the H.266 reference codec VTM while using less than 3k MACs per pixel for decoding, an order of magnitude fewer operations than comparable neural codecs. C3 is further extended to video compression by adapting operations and architectures to the spatio-temporal domain. On the UVG benchmark, C3 achieves rate-distortion performance on par with the Video Compression Transformer while using less than 0.1% as many decoding operations. By greatly reducing decoding complexity compared to general neural codecs while retaining competitive compression, C3 represents an important step towards practical adoption of learned video compression.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

C3 is a neural image and video compression method that overfits a small model per instance to achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance with an order of magnitude lower decoding complexity compared to other neural codecs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces C3, a neural image and video compression method that builds on COOL-CHIC and makes several improvements to achieve competitive rate-distortion performance while maintaining very low decoding complexity. The main contributions are:

1) A series of simple but effective optimizations to COOL-CHIC's quantization-aware training procedure and model architecture that improve rate-distortion performance by over 20% on images while keeping the decoding complexity around 3k MACs per pixel.

2) Extending the methodology to videos and introducing techniques like wider context, custom masking, etc. that allow C3 to handle video data. C3 achieves rate-distortion performance on par with state-of-the-art neural video codec VCT while requiring less than 0.1% of its decoding complexity (~4k MACs per pixel).

3) Demonstrating for the first time a neural image codec that matches the performance of the standard VTM while having more than an order of magnitude lower decoding complexity. On the video side, C3 also shows promising results as a low-complexity alternative to other neural video codecs.

In summary, the main contribution is a highly performant yet low complexity neural codec for both images and videos that is competitive with state-of-the-art standards while being much more efficient to decode.

The paper introduces C3, an improved neural compression method building on COOL-CHIC, that achieves competitive rate-distortion performance to standard codecs like H.266 while having very low decoding complexity. It does this by overfitting separate models to each image or video. Key innovations include soft-rounding and custom noise distributions to better approximate quantization during training, more expressive neural architectures, and video-specific techniques like learned masking. The method represents the state-of-the-art in low complexity neural image compression, and shows promising results on video as well.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage optimization procedure. What is the motivation behind having two stages instead of a single joint optimization? How do the two stages differ in their approximation of quantization and handling of gradients?

2. Soft-rounding and addition of noise are used to approximate quantization in stage 1. Explain the reasoning behind adding noise even when using the invertible soft-rounding function. How does the proposed Kumaraswamy noise distribution help over uniform noise?

3. The second stage uses a straight-through gradient estimator which is known to be biased. What alternatives could be explored to get lower bias gradients in this stage? How crucial is stage 2 for the overall performance?

4. The entropy model predicts the parameters of a Laplace distribution autoregressively. What are some other conditional probabilistic models you could explore for this? Would modeling cross-grid dependencies in the entropy model help? 

5. For video, a wider context is used to handle greater motion across frames. Explain the custom masking scheme proposed to avoid an explosion in parameters. How is the mask location learned?

6. The synthesis network uses a simple convolutional network. What architectural changes could you explore to improve RD performance while keeping decoding complexity similar? 

7. The paper demonstrates a significant boost over prior work COOL-CHICv2. Perform detailed ablations to analyze the contribution of different components of C3 over COOL-CHICv2.

8. Encoding times are slow for C3. Propose modifications to accelerate the encoding while keeping the decoding efficient. For example, explore better initialization strategies.

9. The model overfits per image/video without generalization. Would allowing some parameter sharing help improve RD performance? How can you balance instance-specificity and generalization?

10. Extend the current video framework to use explicit motion compensation across frames instead of relying solely on the entropy model to capture motion. What challenges do you foresee?
