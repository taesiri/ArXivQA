# [C3: High-performance and low-complexity neural compression from a single   image or video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02753)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces C3, a neural image and video compression method that overfits a small model to each instance, achieving state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance among overfitted codecs while requiring very low decoding complexity. C3 builds on prior work COOL-CHIC and makes several improvements including better approximation of quantization during training and more expressive network architectures. On the CLIC2020 image benchmark, C3 matches the performance of the H.266 reference codec VTM while using less than 3k MACs per pixel for decoding, an order of magnitude fewer operations than comparable neural codecs. C3 is further extended to video compression by adapting operations and architectures to the spatio-temporal domain. On the UVG benchmark, C3 achieves rate-distortion performance on par with the Video Compression Transformer while using less than 0.1% as many decoding operations. By greatly reducing decoding complexity compared to general neural codecs while retaining competitive compression, C3 represents an important step towards practical adoption of learned video compression.
