## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Chemical synthesis plays a crucial role in material and drug discovery but analyzing the vast amounts of chemical literature data is challenging due to the unstructured format and writing diversity. Traditional AI methods for literature mining struggle with adapting to new texts and require laborious manual effort for rule/prompt design. This hinders utilizing the available data to unearth reaction patterns and mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an end-to-end AI agent framework that automates high-fidelity extraction from chemical literature using large language models (LLMs). The key aspects are:

1. Employing ChatGPT for prompt building to enhance language interaction between different LLMs. 

2. Setting the literature database as the environment for automatic prompt refinement based on pre-defined criteria.

3. Linking the execution to a GPT-based function and using a text-perception agent to iteratively optimize the self-driven instructions.

4. Building a literature mining pipeline with an executable API for convenient utilization.

Main Contributions:

1. A novel AI agent approach for chemical literature mining that automates data collection/analysis to save labor and boost performance. 

2. A quantitative evaluation scheme for the agent using accuracy, recall and F1 score of extracted reaction conditions to ensure efficiency.

3. Comparisons to human experts in terms of content correctness and time efficiency to validate the agent's permissibility.

4. Ablation studies of the key techniques to demonstrate their validity.

The agent marks a significant advancement in automating chemical literature extraction. By mimicking a diligent chemist, it shows immense potential to revolutionize data management and utilization in chemistry.
