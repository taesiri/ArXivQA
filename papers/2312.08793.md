# [Forbidden Facts: An Investigation of Competing Objectives in Llama-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08793)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies how Llama-2 chat models resolve competing objectives, using a "forbidden fact" task where the model must answer a factual recall question without stating the correct answer. The authors find that forbidding the right answer drastically reduces the probability of Llama-2 stating it correctly. By decomposing Llama-2 into over 1000 components, they identify around 35 key components that reliably implement this suppression behavior. However, analysis shows these components use messy, heterogeneous heuristics rather than a simple suppression algorithm. One faulty heuristic was exploited to craft an "California attack" that fools the model by innocuously placing the correct answer in the prompt. Overall, the complex mechanisms behind even simple behaviors pose challenges for interpretability and providing guarantees about model behavior. The results suggest goals like human-understandable explanations may be difficult for advanced AI. However, this could be because Llama-2 uses unintelligent heuristics, rather than such complexity being inherent to intelligence.
