# [InceptionCaps: A Performant Glaucoma Classification Model for   Data-scarce Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Early detection is critical but challenging due to its asymptomatic nature. 
- Manual screening using retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is complex, time-consuming and lacks expertise.
- CNNs have limitations in handling part-whole relationships and require large datasets. Obtaining labelled fundus images is difficult.  
- Existing public datasets for glaucoma classification are small and imbalanced.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper reviews 4 state-of-the-art deep learning models for glaucoma classification - AlexNet, GoogLeNet, transfer learning on RIM-ONE, and CapsNet.
- It demonstrates transfer learning is better than data augmentation for limited data.
- It evaluates efficacy of CapsNet with changes in convolutional layers and routing algorithms. 
- It proposes InceptionCaps - A novel model with pre-trained InceptionV3 as convolution base for CapsNet.

Contributions:
- Reproduced results for 4 state-of-the-art models using public datasets.
- Showed CapsNet performs better than CNNs with full fundus images without augmentation.
- Demonstrated effects of varying convolutional layers and routing algorithms in CapsNet.  
- InceptionCaps achieved accuracy of 0.956 and AUC of 0.9556 on RIM-ONE dataset outperforming several state-of-the-art models, validating its robustness.

The paper makes key contributions in evaluating various deep learning techniques for glaucoma classification under data constraints and proposes a highly accurate model as a reliable screening tool to assist ophthalmologists.
