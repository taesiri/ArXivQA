# [Internet of Federated Digital Twins (IoFDT): Connecting Twins Beyond   Borders for Society 5.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06432)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel concept called the Internet of Federated Digital Twins (IoFDT), which interconnects networks of heterogeneous digital twins (DTs) representing diverse physical systems and services. The IoFDT features a hierarchical architecture integrating DTs through horizontal and vertical interactions to enable multi-layered insights and system-wide coordination. Key challenges are identified across communication, computing, and AI to realize the IoFDT vision, including synchronization, cross-layer networking, real-time edge computing, scalability, security, continual learning models, AI-native networks, and generalizability of twins. The paper emphasizes the need for a unified IoFDT platform integrating DT, network, and computing orchestrators for seamless DT interactions. A proof-of-concept focused on smart mobility applications is introduced as an initial step towards demonstrating the feasibility of IoFDT. Overall, the IoFDT concept promises to revolutionize future smart services and industries by bridging cyber and physical spaces for optimized decision-making and operations.
