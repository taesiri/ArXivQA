# [iMatching: Imperative Correspondence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02141)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new self-supervised learning framework called iMatching for training feature correspondence models using only unannotated video sequences. It formulates the problem as a bilevel optimization, with bundle adjustment (BA) at the lower level optimizing camera poses and 3D landmark positions to minimize reprojection error given the model-predicted correspondences. At the upper level, the model parameters are updated to minimize the final reprojection error from BA. This eliminates the need for ground truth labels and allows the BA process to provide supervision. To enable end-to-end learning without differentiating through the complex BA computations, the authors leverage the stationary point of the BA optimization to implicitly calculate gradients after convergence. Experiments demonstrate that iMatching boosts state-of-the-art matching models like ASpanFormer, improving feature matching accuracy by 13.6% and pose estimation accuracy by over 30% on unseen datasets. The robust BA process is critical to handling outliers and enabling the performance gains. Overall, iMatching sets a new bar for self-supervised correspondence learning without any labels.
