# [Federated Learning Method for Preserving Privacy in Face Recognition   System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Face recognition systems typically require collecting large datasets of facial images to train models, raising privacy concerns as this data is sensitive. 
- Centralized training also places strain on communication infrastructure due to heavy data transmission.

Proposed Solution:
- Employ federated learning to train face recognition models without needing to share raw facial data. 
- Models are trained on decentralized edge devices locally housing the data. Each device trains an individual model using its data.
- Individual model updates are transmitted to a central server directly or via a secure aggregator.
- Server aggregates updates to construct a global model, which is sent back to devices.

Contributions:
- Proposed supervised and unsupervised face recognition systems using federated learning to preserve privacy.
- Edge devices use client data and GAN-generated imposter data to train individual models. 
- Analysis of secure aggregator's impact on model performance vs privacy.
- Without aggregator, federated model achieves 6-26% better EER than individual models. 
- With aggregator, slight drop in EER but model privacy is enhanced.
- Show trade-off between privacy and accuracy for face recognition using federated learning.

In summary, the paper proposes novel federated learning based face recognition systems that train models on devices without sharing raw data to address privacy concerns. The analysis offers insights into balancing privacy and accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of privacy-preserving face recognition using collaborative edge learning.
