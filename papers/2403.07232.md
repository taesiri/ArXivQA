# [Tractable Joint Prediction and Planning over Discrete Behavior Modes for   Urban Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07232)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction models have made progress for autonomous driving, but effectively integrating them with downstream planners is still an open challenge. 
- Conventional approaches treat prediction and planning separately, leading to conservative behaviors like the "frozen robot problem".
- Fully reactive closed-loop planning over learned models is desired, but often intractable due to the exponential growth of possibilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Show trajectory prediction models trained open-loop can parameterize closed-loop models without retraining.  
- Propose planning over discrete latent modes that compactly represent high-level behaviors. This allows tractable and fully reactive closed-loop planning.
- Validate the approach on challenging urban driving scenarios requiring frequent merging. Outperforms baselines in success rate and avoiding overly conservative behaviors.
- Also outperform state-of-the-art on the CARLA Longest6 benchmark when evaluated at realistic speeds.

Main Contributions:
- Show open-loop trained trajectory forecasting models can facilitate closed-loop prediction and planning without modification.
- Propose tractable closed-loop planning by searching over a discrete latent space of high-level behaviors. Scales better than continuous latent alternatives.  
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on a suite of highly interactive merging scenarios and the CARLA Longest6 benchmark.
- Approach is fully reactive and avoids the "frozen robot problem" that hurts other planners.

In summary, the paper presents a novel planning approach over discrete latent driving modes that enables tractable and effective closed-loop planning for autonomous vehicles. Key advantages are computational efficiency, avoiding overly conservative behaviors, and state-of-the-art performance in complex urban driving scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for closed-loop planning over learned multimodal trajectory forecasting models by using discrete latent modes to enable tractable fully reactive planning while capturing diverse driving behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Showing how trajectory prediction models trained open-loop with learned anchor embeddings can be used to parameterize autoregressive closed-loop models without needing to retrain. 

2) Proposing a novel planning approach that leverages discrete latent modes to do planning over a compact latent behavior space. This allows tractable modeling of causal interactions between agents during autoregressive rollouts. The approach scales linearly rather than exponentially with the number of agents and planning horizon.

3) Validating the approach on a suite of dynamic merging scenarios requiring proactive planning behaviors, where it outperforms baselines. The method also exceeds state-of-the-art performance on the CARLA Longest6 benchmark when evaluated at realistic speeds.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling fully reactive closed-loop planning over multimodal trajectory forecasts by planning over discrete latent driving modes. This allows properly modeling interactive driving behaviors during planning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using learned anchor embeddings to parameterize distinct driving behavior modes. What is the intuition behind using anchor embeddings versus other approaches like clustering or discrete latent variable models? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper claims their approach is the first to show how open-loop prediction models can be adapted for closed-loop planning without retraining. What modifications need to be made to conventional open-loop forecasting models to facilitate closed-loop planning?

3. The paper argues that planning over discrete latent driving modes allows them to tractably model causal interactions between agents. Explain this argument and why modeling these interactions is important for closed-loop urban driving scenarios.  

4. Explain the model architecture and objective functions used to train the multimodal transformer forecasting model. What design choices were made to facilitate planning?

5. The paper adopts a winner-takes-all training objective. Explain this objective and why it may be suitable for modeling distinct, semantically meaningful modes. What are potential downsides?

6. Explain the MPC planning approach over discrete ego latent modes. In particular, discuss the approximations made regarding consistency of latent modes over time and how stochasticity is handled.

7. The paper introduces additional metrics beyond crashes and traffic infractions to assess performance in urban driving scenarios. Explain these metrics and why they may better evaluate assertive driving behavior.

8. Compare and contrast the proposed approach to existing methods for planning with learned models like CfO. In particular, discuss the tradeoffs of planning over discrete vs. continuous latent variable models.  

9. The paper finds that their closed-loop planning approach leads to more assertive merging behaviors compared to the open-loop variant. Provide an intuition for why this occurs.

10. The paper shows their approach exceeds expert demonstration performance on a suite of urban driving tasks. Explain why this suggests their planning approach is robust and not simply relying on dominant modes in the demonstration data.
