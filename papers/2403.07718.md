# [WorkArena: How Capable Are Web Agents at Solving Common Knowledge Work   Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on evaluating the capability of web agents, AI systems that can interact with web interfaces, on enterprise software tasks. Prior benchmarks for web agents consist mainly of toy tasks or generic websites. However, enterprise platforms like ServiceNow, used widely across businesses worldwide, present a unique set of challenges such as complex and dynamic UIs and very large website structures. Assessing and improving web agent performance on such real-world enterprise tasks can enable impactful automation to improve productivity and accessibility in workplaces.  

Proposed Solution & Contributions:

1. The paper introduces WorkArena, a benchmark of 29 realistic enterprise-related tasks with over 23,000 instances built using the ServiceNow platform. The tasks cover common workflows like filling forms, searching knowledge bases, ordering from catalogs and sorting task lists.

2. The paper proposes BrowserGym, a new environment for developing and testing web agents. BrowserGym offers rich observations (DOM, visual screenshot, accessibility tree), a flexible action space (Python code, keyboard/mouse actions) and chat-based user interaction.

3. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that WorkArena poses a significant challenge for current web agents. The best agent (GPT-4-based) obtains only 55% success rate, far below human performance. Analysis reveals strengths of large proprietary models like GPT-4 and weaknesses of open-source models on such complex real-world tasks.

In summary, the paper makes both benchmarking and software contributions to facilitate progress on enterprise-centric web automation and quantitatively measures the current capability gap to guide future research towards impactful real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces WorkArena, a benchmark of 29 realistic enterprise software tasks, and BrowserGym, a flexible environment for developing and evaluating web agents, then empirically studies the performance of LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on these tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) WorkArena: A realistic benchmark of enterprise-related tasks for web agents comprising 23,150 unique task instances that cover common ways of interacting with the ServiceNow platform, a widely-used enterprise software platform.

2) BrowserGym: A new environment for the development and evaluation of web agents, compatible with previous benchmarks, that offers richer multimodal observations (e.g. screenshot, accessibility tree, screen coordinates), a broader set of actions (e.g. Python code and high-level primitives), and supports chat-based interactions.

3) An empirical study assessing the ability of state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based agents to solve WorkArena, as well as an analysis of the impact of different BrowserGym features on WorkArena and MiniWoB.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of WorkArena, a new challenging benchmark focused on enterprise software tasks, along with BrowserGym, a flexible environment for developing and evaluating web agents. The paper also includes an empirical evaluation of LLMs on these new benchmarks.
