# [From Text to Motion: Grounding GPT-4 in a Humanoid Robot "Alter3"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06571)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper reports on the development of Alter3, a humanoid robot integrated with the GPT-4 large language model to enable the generation of spontaneous motions and gestures. By leveraging GPT-4's vast knowledge and mapping linguistic descriptions of human actions onto Alter3's physical form, the robot can adopt poses and enact sequences of motions purely from textual prompts, without the need for explicit programming of individual joints. Remarkably, this allows for zero-shot learning of various actions like taking selfies or pretending to be a ghost, with Alter3 also displaying appropriate emotional expressions. Additionally, a feedback system enables refinement of motions through verbal advice rather than code rewriting. To enhance conversational abilities, Alter3's "mind" comprises six distinct GPT-4 personalities that interact with humans and each other. Analysis of these conversations reveals attractors that stagnate development without human intervention. Ultimately, by grounding GPT-4 through Alter3's physicality, this research explores the embodiment of language models, their integration with real-world robots, and the emergence of more natural human-machine interaction.
