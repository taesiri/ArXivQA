# [Approximate Nullspace Augmented Finetuning for Robust Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) lack robustness to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts compared to CNNs. The nullspace of models can provide insights on robustness so the authors hypothesize that increasing the ViT's tolerance to nullspace perturbations can improve robustness.

Method:
- Propose nullspace augmentation via "ε-approximate nullspace" - perturbations that have only a small influence (bounded by ε) on model predictions.  
- Generate random noise vectors and update them to reduce influence on predictions, making them approximate nullspace vectors.
- Use these vectors to augment training data and fine-tune ViT models.

Experiments:
- Test on ImageNet-1K and robustness benchmarks like ImageNet-C, ImageNet-A, etc. under different attacks.
- Show nullspace augmentation consistently improves robustness over vanilla ViTs and competes with state-of-the-art defense.
- Study effect of hyperparameters like ε; ablation shows benefit over random noise.
- Analyze properties of learned approximate nullspace.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel nullspace augmentation method to improve vision transformer robustness by increasing nullspace tolerance.
- Connections shown between nullspace and model robustness.
- Consistent gains demonstrated across different datasets, model sizes, and attacks.
- Analysis and validation of properties of the proposed ε-approximate nullspace.

In summary, the paper proposes a new data augmentation technique using approximate nullspace vectors to improve robustness of vision transformers. Experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of this method and its connection to model robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to improve the robustness of vision transformers by augmenting the training data with noise sampled from an approximate nullspace of the model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

1) Proposing a method to augment the training of vision transformers by adding noise sampled from an "epsilon-approximate nullspace" in order to improve their robustness. Specifically, they show that adding such noise during training leads to an "enlarged epsilon-approximate nullspace" which is accompanied by improved robustness of the model under distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.

2) Demonstrating through experiments that their proposed nullspace augmentation method consistently improves model robustness, outperforming baselines on several vision transformer architectures. They also show that the epsilon-approximate nullspace they learn exhibits properties like closure under scalar multiplication and addition.

3) Drawing a connection between the tolerance of vision transformers to nullspace noise and their robustness, and providing empirical validation of this hypothesis.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be in using an epsilon-approximate nullspace for data augmentation to improve vision transformer robustness, the method itself, and experimental demonstration of its effectiveness. The theoretical connection drawn between nullspace tolerance and robustness also seems to be an important contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Nullspace training/augmentation
- $\epsilon$-approximate nullspace 
- Vision transformers (ViT)
- Robustness 
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
- Adversarial attacks (FGSM, CW, DamageNet, PatchFool)
- ImageNet variants (ImageNet-C, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-V2, etc.)
- Madry and TRADES adversarial training
- Trends of noise norm, robustness scores 
- Closure properties of approximate nullspace
- Key models: ViT-small, ViT-base, ViT-base with Discrete Adversarial Training (DAT)

The main focus seems to be on using nullspace noise injection during training to improve the robustness and OOD generalization of vision transformers. The key idea is that by enlarging the ε-approximate nullspace that the model is tolerant to, one can improve robustness. The experiments show consistent gains across different vision transformer models and evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes that there exists an "epsilon-approximate nullspace" for vision transformer models. What is the intuition behind this concept and how is it formally defined? What properties would we expect this nullspace to have?

2. What motivates the hypothesis that increasing robustness to noise in the epsilon-approximate nullspace could improve model robustness more broadly? What is the theoretical basis behind this connection? 

3. The noise vectors added during training are updated every 40 steps. What impact could the frequency of noise vector updates have? What tradeoffs are involved in updating them more or less frequently?

4. How exactly is the performance on out-of-distribution datasets improved by training with epsilon-approximate nullspace noise? Does it enable the model to generalize better or is a different mechanism at play?

5. The ablation study shows that the method is relatively robust to the choice of epsilon. What explains this insensitivity to the epsilon value? Over what range would you expect the performance to degrade?

6. The paper shows the learned noise vectors have an increasing norm during training. What does this suggest about how the epsilon-approximate nullspace changes over the course of training? 

7. The method improves robustness to patch-based attacks like PatchFool. How might training on nullspace noise vectors enable better robustness to localized perturbations specifically?

8. The comparison shows worse performance on white-box attacks relative to adversarial training methods. Why might explicitly optimizing on adversarial examples result in better worst-case robustness?

9. The convex combinations visualization provides evidence that the epsilon-approximate nullspace has vector space structure. Does this provide any additional insight into why the noise vectors improve robustness?

10. The performance trends show a gradual increase in robustness over training time. What dynamics drive this continual improvement? And what causes the fluctuations observed?
