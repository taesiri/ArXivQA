# [Approximate Nullspace Augmented Finetuning for Robust Vision   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) lack robustness to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts compared to CNNs. The nullspace of models can provide insights on robustness so the authors hypothesize that increasing the ViT's tolerance to nullspace perturbations can improve robustness.

Method:
- Propose nullspace augmentation via "ε-approximate nullspace" - perturbations that have only a small influence (bounded by ε) on model predictions.  
- Generate random noise vectors and update them to reduce influence on predictions, making them approximate nullspace vectors.
- Use these vectors to augment training data and fine-tune ViT models.

Experiments:
- Test on ImageNet-1K and robustness benchmarks like ImageNet-C, ImageNet-A, etc. under different attacks.
- Show nullspace augmentation consistently improves robustness over vanilla ViTs and competes with state-of-the-art defense.
- Study effect of hyperparameters like ε; ablation shows benefit over random noise.
- Analyze properties of learned approximate nullspace.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel nullspace augmentation method to improve vision transformer robustness by increasing nullspace tolerance.
- Connections shown between nullspace and model robustness.
- Consistent gains demonstrated across different datasets, model sizes, and attacks.
- Analysis and validation of properties of the proposed ε-approximate nullspace.

In summary, the paper proposes a new data augmentation technique using approximate nullspace vectors to improve robustness of vision transformers. Experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of this method and its connection to model robustness.
