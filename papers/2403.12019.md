# [LN3Diff: Scalable Latent Neural Fields Diffusion for Speedy 3D   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advances in generative models and differentiable rendering have enabled promising progress in neural rendering for view synthesis and 3D object generation. While 2D diffusion models have achieved great success, developing a unified 3D diffusion pipeline remains challenging. Existing methods either rely on costly per-instance optimization or two-stage training, hindering scalability and efficiency. Moreover, current 3D diffusion models focus solely on category-specific unconditional generation, lacking the flexibility for conditional generation on generic 3D datasets.

Method:
This paper introduces \nickname{}, a novel framework for fast, high-quality, and generic conditional 3D generation. The key idea is to learn the diffusion model over a compact 3D-aware latent space. Specifically:

1) A variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed to compress input images into a structured latent space in an amortized manner. This addresses the scalability issue in prior arts. 

2) A transformer-based decoder is used to decode latents into high-capacity 3D neural fields, enabling efficient diffusion learning later on. The training only requires 2 views per instance.

3) Diffusion models are trained over the learned latent space to acquire strong 3D generation priors. Classifier-free guidance is used to enable both conditional and unconditional sampling.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first end-to-end pipeline to learn 3D diffusion over a compressed latent space, achieving superior efficiency without per-instance optimization.

- Surpasses GAN methods on ShapeNet and demonstrates, for the first time, conditional generation on generic 3D datasets like Objaverse.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on monocular 3D reconstruction while having 3x faster sampling speed than other 3D diffusion techniques.

- Offers opportunities to enable various 3D vision and graphics tasks in the future, thanks to the learned latent space and generalizable pipeline.

In summary, this work presents a significant step towards efficient and generic 3D generative modeling with diffusion models. The introduced pipeline and idea of latent space diffusion could inspire more future research.
