# [User Modeling and User Profiling: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09660)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the large and continuously evolving fields of user modeling and user profiling. The key motivation behind this work is to present an up-to-date overview of the current state of research in these areas, filling a gap left by previous surveys which covered the literature only up to 2018/2019.  

The paper begins with a historical background, tracing the origins of user modeling back to the late 1970s when the notions of "user model" and "user modeling" were first introduced. It then examines previous surveys in the field, providing a critical analysis of their contributions. A key focus is an in-depth terminology analysis to eliminate ambiguity around core concepts like "user model", "user profile", "user modeling" and "user profiling". Clear, encyclopedic definitions are proposed for these terms to establish a coherent understanding.  

The paper thoroughly explores the major paradigm shifts caused by technological advancements, specifically highlighting the transitions towards implicit user profiling, sophisticated behavior modeling techniques, universal user representations, evaluation via classification tasks and simulated data, adoption of graph structures and deep learning architectures, and a focus on beyond-accuracy considerations like privacy, fairness and explainability. Emerging trends are also identified in crucial domains such as fake news detection, social networks, cybersecurity and online education.

A formal taxonomy is presented, encompassing all active research topics in user modeling and profiling. This taxonomy serves as a valuable guide for researchers, offering a structured perspective on the field.  

The paper concludes with a discussion of enduring themes in user modeling as well as future research directions aligned with principles of Human-Centered AI. Key highlights include human-AI collaboration, advanced user models, ethical and equitable modeling, integration of cognitive sciences, AI systems that understand user goals and cross-modal interaction.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions by providing the most comprehensive contemporary survey of user modeling and profiling literature. Through its historical analysis, taxonomy development, terminology clarification and examination of paradigm shifts and emerging trends, it offers an invaluable reference that will shape future scholarship.
