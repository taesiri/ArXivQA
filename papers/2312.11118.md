# [Explaining Reinforcement Learning Agents Through Counterfactual Action   Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Explaining the behavior of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is challenging, yet important for establishing appropriate trust and collaboration. Prior work on explainable RL has focused on local explanations that describe an agent's reasoning for a specific decision. However, these typically do not show the outcomes of the agent's actions. 

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces "COViz", a new local explanation method that visually compares the actual trajectory of an RL agent to a counterfactual trajectory showing what would have happened if the agent took an alternative action. Specifically, at each step COViz shows side-by-side videos depicting the outcomes of the agent's chosen action versus its second best action. This highlights the tradeoffs between actions. The paper also proposes augmenting global explanation methods like policy summaries with COViz to select states based on action outcomes.  

Additionally, the paper integrates COViz with reward decomposition, another local explanation showing the expected rewards for different actions. Together these complement each other by answering "what if?" and "why?" questions about the agent's behavior.

Contributions:
(1) Introduces COViz, a new local explanation method based on counterfactual outcomes
(2) Proposes augmenting global explanations by selecting states based on COViz
(3) Integrates COViz with reward decomposition 
(4) Conducts user studies showing COViz helps understanding on its own, and integrating it with reward decomposition significantly improves understanding compared to each method separately

The user studies found that while the integrated explanations led to the best task performance in assessing agent preferences, participants subjectively preferred seeing only one explanation type to avoid cognitive overload. Overall, the paper demonstrates the value of COViz and of combining complementary local explanation methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new local explanation method called COViz that visually compares the outcome of an RL agent's chosen action to a counterfactual one and shows through user studies that integrating COViz with reward decomposition explanations significantly improves people's understanding of agent preferences compared to each method separately.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It introduces COViz, a new local explanation method that visually compares the outcome of an agent's chosen action to a counterfactual one in order to highlight the trade-offs between different actions. 

2) It proposes an extension to generate global explanations augmented by COViz by selecting summary states based on alternative action outcomes. 

3) It integrates COViz with reward decomposition explanations, combining an explanation that shows "what if" with one that shows "why" an action was chosen.

4) It conducts user studies evaluating COViz on its own and integrated with reward decomposition. The studies show that:

(a) COViz is beneficial on its own for understanding agent preferences 
(b) Integrating COViz with reward decomposition leads to significantly improved user performance in assessing agent preferences compared to either method on its own.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing the COViz method, showing how to integrate it with other explanations, and empirically demonstrating its utility alone and in combination with reward decomposition.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
- Local explanations
- Counterfactual explanations
- Counterfactual outcomes
- Reward decomposition 
- Policy summarization
- User studies
- Highway environment
- Agent preferences
- Complementary explanations

The paper introduces a new local explanation method called "COViz" which visualizes counterfactual outcomes by showing alternative trajectories an RL agent could have taken. It also proposes integrating COViz with reward decomposition explanations. User studies evaluate these methods and their combination in helping people understand agent preferences. The highway driving environment is used as the testbed. Overall, the key focus is on local explainability methods, counterfactuals, and complementary explanations in XRL.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new local explanation method called COViz. What is the key idea behind COViz and how does it provide explanations? Discuss the algorithm and visualization approach used.

2. How does COViz draw inspiration from the DISAGREEMENTS algorithm? What modifications were made to adapt DISAGREEMENTS to the single agent setting for COViz?

3. The paper argues that COViz naturally complements reward decomposition explanations. Discuss why these two methods are complementary. What different questions do they aim to answer about the agent's behavior? 

4. What are some ways the counterfactual action could be selected in COViz, beyond using the second best action? Discuss the limitations of only using a single counterfactual and how this could be addressed.  

5. The global extension integrates COViz into policy summaries. Explain the approach used for state selection and trajectory ranking. What other methods could be used? Discuss tradeoffs.

6. The user studies aim to evaluate if COViz alone or integrated with reward decomposition improves understanding of agent preferences. Discuss the study design, tasks, conditions compared and key results. 

7. The results show improved performance from combining COViz and reward decomposition. Why might this be the case? How do the explanations complement each other?

8. The subjective rankings differed from the objective performance measures regarding the explanation types. What hypotheses are proposed in the paper for this discrepancy?  

9. How could the issue of high cognitive load when integrating multiple explanations be addressed? Suggest and critically discuss some ideas.

10. The limitations discuss vulnerabilities in state selection for COViz. Propose some ways the state selection process could be improved to address these limitations. Discuss tradeoffs.
