# [From Canteen Food to Daily Meals: Generalizing Food Recognition to More   Practical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing food image datasets are collected from professional kitchens/restaurants and hence exhibit low intra-class variance. This causes a domain shift when models trained on these datasets are applied to real-world daily life food images that have high intra-class variance. This hinders the development of practical food recognition systems.

Proposed Solution:
1) Introduce two new datasets - DailyFood-172 and DailyFood-16 containing images of daily life dishes to benchmark food recognition models.

2) Propose a Multi-Cluster Reference Learning (MCRL) method for unsupervised domain adaptation that handles the high intra-class variance. It aligns target samples with multiple top-k predicted source clusters instead of just the top predicted cluster. This handles ambiguity in category prediction and is more robust. 

Main Contributions:
1) Two new datasets - DailyFood-172 with 172 categories and DailyFood-16 with 16 categories containing 42,312 and 1,695 daily life food images respectively to evaluate model transferability.

2) Multi-Cluster Reference Learning technique that aligns target data with multiple source clusters for more effective domain adaptation. Can flexibly integrate with other UDA methods.

3) Extensive experiments showing the domain shift from existing datasets and improved performance with MCRL. Up to 2.77% and 3.11% improvement over state-of-the-art on the two datasets.

In summary, the paper identifies the domain shift challenge for food recognition, contributes new datasets to benchmark it and proposes an effective baseline method to handle the shift.
