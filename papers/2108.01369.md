## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on evaluating dialogue systems:

- The paper provides a thorough taxonomy and review of existing methods for evaluating dialogue systems, categorizing them into automatic, human-involved, and user simulator-based approaches. This kind of comprehensive literature review is valuable for summarizing the state of research in this area.

- The authors make an effort to cover the full range of evaluation approaches, from word-overlap metrics to neural models to human studies. This breadth of coverage is useful for seeing the big picture of how dialogue systems are evaluated.

- The paper nicely summarizes the limitations and open challenges with current evaluation methods. Identifying these gaps can help motivate new research directions. For example, the authors highlight the need for more dynamic and interactive evaluation, as well as better user simulators.

- The discussion of evaluation benchmarks is helpful for understanding the testbeds used to assess new methods. Covering multiple benchmarks like ParlAI, ConvLab, and GENIE gives a sense of the options available.

- Compared to some other survey papers, this one has less technical depth on the mathematical aspects or implementation details of specific evaluation metrics. The focus is more on categorization and high-level trends.

- The paper mostly covers evaluation of open-domain conversational dialogue systems. Other surveys go deeper on goal-oriented/task-oriented systems or human-robot interaction.

Overall, this paper provides a solid reference for researchers looking to get an overview of the dialogue evaluation landscape. It summarizes the research well at a high level rather than providing an exhaustive technical treatment. The suggested future directions help point the way for advancing evaluation methods going forward.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Reference-free evaluation methods: The authors point out that current evaluation methods rely on comparing the generated response to ground truth responses from the dataset. However, there can be multiple valid responses in real conversations, so reference-free evaluation methods that do not require ground truth responses are needed.

2. Interactively dynamic evaluation: Current evaluation methods evaluate each turn separately without considering the errors propagated across turns. More interactive and dynamic evaluation methods are needed to better reflect real conversational interactions.

3. User simulators with fluent natural language: Most existing user simulators only interact through structured formal languages. More user simulators that can evaluate dialogue systems by interacting with fluent natural language are needed. 

4. Redefining the role of user simulation: The authors suggest that user simulation should be redefined as a sequential decision making problem where the user simulator adapts to the dialogue system's responses. This allows evaluating how well the dialogue system can assist the user simulator in achieving its goal.

5. Comprehensive evaluation: Evaluation methods need to capture all aspects of dialogue quality including coherence, engagement, flow, long-term success, etc. Current methods are limited in evaluating certain aspects. 

In summary, the key future directions are developing more open-domain reference-free evaluation methods, building user simulators that can interact naturally, and evaluating dialogue systems more comprehensively in conversational settings. The overall goal is to better correlate evaluation with real human judgment of dialogue quality.
