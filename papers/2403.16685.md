# [ToXCL: A Unified Framework for Toxic Speech Detection and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Toxic speech detection has received attention, but detecting and explaining implicit toxic speech remains challenging. Implicit toxic speech relies on indirect language and stereotypes rather than explicit offensive words.  
- Prior work formulates toxic speech detection and explanation as a text generation problem, which can suffer from error propagation and have lower detection capability compared to detection-only models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ToXCL, a unified framework consisting of three components:
   1) Target Group Generator: Generates target minority groups associated with the toxic speech using an encoder-decoder model.
   2) Encoder-Decoder Model: The encoder detects implicit toxic speech, and the decoder generates explanations if toxic speech is detected. A classifier head is added to the encoder.
   3) Teacher Classifier: Distills knowledge to the encoder classifier via teacher forcing to enhance detection capability.
- Additionally, a Conditional Decoding Constraint is introduced to avoid generating unnecessary explanations for non-toxic speech during inference.

Key Contributions:
- Sets new state-of-the-art on implicit toxic speech detection and explanation tasks on two benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines.
- Proposes a unified framework that joins detection and explanation tasks on an encoder-decoder model, avoiding error propagation.
- Introduces architectural enhancements like teacher forcing and conditional decoding to further improve performance.  
- Demonstrates the importance of modeling target groups associated with the toxic speech in improving detection and explanation.
- Provides thorough analysis and discussions on the framework and potential societal impacts.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through ToXCL in advancing the state-of-the-art in implicit toxic speech detection and explanation, while analyzing the model behavior and discussing associated ethical considerations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ToXCL, a unified framework with three components - a Target Group Generator, an Encoder-Decoder model, and a Teacher Classifier - for effectively detecting implicit toxic speech and generating explanations for its toxicity, achieving state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing ToXCL, a unified framework for toxic speech detection and explanation. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) ToXCL integrates both implicit toxic speech detection and explanation into an encoder-decoder model to avoid the error propagation problem while maintaining competitive performance on both tasks.

2) It proposes to generate target groups for the toxic speech detection and explanation model through an encoder-decoder model, distinguishing it from previous methods. 

3) It introduces several techniques to enhance the framework's performance, including joint training, using teacher forcing to train the encoder, and a Conditional Decoding Constraint during inference.

4) It achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, the Implicit Hate Corpus and Social Bias Inference Corpus, for both implicit toxic speech detection and explanation tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is designing a unified framework that can effectively detect implicit toxic speech and generate explanations for its toxicity in an end-to-end manner, outperforming previous approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a Target Group Generator module to generate target minority groups associated with the input post. What is the motivation behind modeling target groups? How does generating target groups help improve the performance of toxic speech detection and explanation?

9) The paper mentions ethical concerns regarding the quality of explanations in the training data. How could this issue propagate harmful biases? Suggest remedies to address these ethical issues.

10) The problem formulation defines the detection task as classification and the explanation task as text generation. Critically analyze this hybrid problem formulation. What are the pros and cons compared to an end-to-end formulation?
