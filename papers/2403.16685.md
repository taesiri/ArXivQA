# [ToXCL: A Unified Framework for Toxic Speech Detection and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Toxic speech detection has received attention, but detecting and explaining implicit toxic speech remains challenging. Implicit toxic speech relies on indirect language and stereotypes rather than explicit offensive words.  
- Prior work formulates toxic speech detection and explanation as a text generation problem, which can suffer from error propagation and have lower detection capability compared to detection-only models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ToXCL, a unified framework consisting of three components:
   1) Target Group Generator: Generates target minority groups associated with the toxic speech using an encoder-decoder model.
   2) Encoder-Decoder Model: The encoder detects implicit toxic speech, and the decoder generates explanations if toxic speech is detected. A classifier head is added to the encoder.
   3) Teacher Classifier: Distills knowledge to the encoder classifier via teacher forcing to enhance detection capability.
- Additionally, a Conditional Decoding Constraint is introduced to avoid generating unnecessary explanations for non-toxic speech during inference.

Key Contributions:
- Sets new state-of-the-art on implicit toxic speech detection and explanation tasks on two benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines.
- Proposes a unified framework that joins detection and explanation tasks on an encoder-decoder model, avoiding error propagation.
- Introduces architectural enhancements like teacher forcing and conditional decoding to further improve performance.  
- Demonstrates the importance of modeling target groups associated with the toxic speech in improving detection and explanation.
- Provides thorough analysis and discussions on the framework and potential societal impacts.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through ToXCL in advancing the state-of-the-art in implicit toxic speech detection and explanation, while analyzing the model behavior and discussing associated ethical considerations.
