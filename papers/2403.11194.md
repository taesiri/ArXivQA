# [MaskDiffusion: Exploiting Pre-trained Diffusion Models for Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic segmentation is important for computer vision but faces challenges like high annotation cost, extensive training needs, and inability to detect rare or new classes. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MaskDiffusion to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using a frozen pre-trained diffusion model (Stable Diffusion), without needing additional training or annotation.

- It utilizes the internal features and cross-attention maps from the diffusion model's UNet, which contain inherent semantic information about objects.

- A representative feature vector is computed for each class by weighting the internal features using the cross-attention maps. Then each pixel's feature is assigned the class with highest cosine similarity.  

- It also proposes an unsupervised version using spectral clustering on the internal feature similarity, removing the need for class name prompts.

Key Contributions:

- Shows internal UNet features from diffusion models preserve semantics useful for segmentation. K-means on features is comparable to common unsupervised methods.

- Introduces MaskDiffusion for open-vocabulary segmentation without additional training, outperforming prior arts like MaskCLIP and GEM.

- Demonstrates strength in handling diverse classes including fine-grained and proper nouns, expanding segmentation scope.  

- Proposes unsupervised MaskDiffusion variant using spectral clustering that also beats prior works for unsupervised segmentation.

- Overall, leverages diffusion model capabilities for both open-vocabulary and unsupervised segmentation with qualitative and quantitative improvements over previous approaches.
