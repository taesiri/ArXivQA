## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning high-level cooperative behaviors in large-scale multi-agent environments is challenging. Specific problems include:
1) Large-scale joint policy exploration: As number of agents increases, the joint action space grows exponentially, making it difficult to explore enough feasible policies. This is worse with sparse rewards.
2) Knowledge incorporation: Integrating prior knowledge can enhance RL performance. Some cooperative behaviors depend on factors not easily simulated (e.g. birds' formation flying depends on aerodynamics).  
3) Interpretability: Agents learn policies via neural networks, which are not interpretable. Diagnosing problems is difficult when agents fail to exhibit expected cooperation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Hierarchical Cooperation Graph Learning (HCGL), a novel hierarchical graph-based MARL model that addresses the above problems. 

Key ideas:
1) Uses a dynamic graph structure called Extensible Cooperation Graph (ECG) to guide agents' cooperative behaviors instead of neural policy networks. ECG groups agents into clusters to execute primitive/cooperative actions towards target nodes.
2) Incorporates expert knowledge by defining cooperative actions (e.g. gathering, encirclement) as target nodes. Unifies primitive and cooperative actions.
3) Uses graph operators (virtual agents) to dynamically adjust ECG topology based on environment, guiding cooperation. Graph operators are trained via RL.  
4) ECG provides interpretability - cooperative behaviors can be visualized via graph topology.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes HCGL, a hierarchical graph-based MARL model for sophisticated cooperation.
2) Presents ECG to guide cooperation, enable knowledge incorporation and provide interpretability.  
3) Shows how graph operators dynamically adjust ECG topology based on environment.
4) Demonstrates HCGL's effectiveness on benchmarks, interpretability and excellent transferability to large-scale multi-agent systems.

In summary, the paper addresses limitations of MARL for large-scale cooperation using a novel learnable graph structure to hierarchically guide agents, incorporate knowledge and provide interpretability. Experiments confirm advantages over state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.
