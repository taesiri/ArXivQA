# [Large Legal Fictions: Profiling Legal Hallucinations in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have potential to transform legal practice, but suffer from "legal hallucinations" - responses that are inconsistent with legal facts
- Lack of systematic analysis quantifying and profiling these hallucinations

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop a typology defining 3 types of legal hallucinations (inconsistency with prompt, training data, or real-world facts)
- Focus empirical analysis on factual inconsistencies as most concerning 
- Design legal research tasks across judicial hierarchy to profile rates and nature of hallucinations
- Also test contra-factual bias and model calibration as additional failure points

Models Evaluated:
- OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, Google's PaLM 2, Meta's Llama 2

Key Findings:
- Factual legal hallucinations are common, occurring 69-88% of the time on legal research tasks
- Rates vary by court level, jurisdiction, case prominence, age, and complexity  
- Models struggle with contra-factual bias and are overconfident in incorrect responses
- Risks highest for marginalized populations meant to benefit most from LLM democratization

Main Contributions:
- First quantification of factual legal hallucinations using case law metadata
- Typology distinguishing closed vs open domain hallucinations  
- Evidence legal LLMs may exacerbate rather than solve access to justice problems
- Highlights normative issues around balancing fidelity to prompt vs real-world facts

The paper provides an important empirical grounding for debates on integrating LLMs into the legal system. It raises concerns about reliability and fairness, while also outlining paths for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper profiles the prevalence of factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) in the responses of large language models to open-ended legal queries, finding widespread hallucination across models and tasks as well as issues with contra-factual bias and overconfidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes four key contributions:

1. It develops a typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research on hallucinations in legal language models. 

2. It finds that legal hallucinations are alarmingly prevalent in large language models like ChatGPT, PaLM, and Llama when they are asked specific, verifiable questions about random federal court cases. The models hallucinate between 69-88% of the time.

3. It shows that these models often fail to correct incorrect legal assumptions that underpin contra-factual questions posed to them.

4. It provides evidence that these models cannot always predict or know when they are producing legal hallucinations. 

In summary, the main contribution is systematically documenting the widespread problem of factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) in legal language models through an original suite of legal knowledge queries. The paper cautions against the unsupervised integration of these models into legal tasks given their propensity for legal hallucination.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Legal hallucinations - Incorrect or non-factual responses from large language models to legal queries
- Typology - The authors develop a taxonomy to categorize different types of legal hallucinations
- Federal case law - The study focuses on analyzing responses to questions about US federal court cases
- Knowledge queries - Questions probing the models' understanding of legal concepts and case details 
- Reference-based evaluation - Assessing hallucinations by comparing model responses to structured case metadata
- Contra-factual bias - Models' tendency to accept false premises in legal questions 
- Model calibration - Whether models can accurately estimate their own uncertainty/hallucination rate
- Access to justice - Concerns that language models may fail to democratize legal services as intended
- Legal monoculture - Risk of models only reflecting legal knowledge from a limited subset of sources

The key themes are analyzing the occurrence of factual errors (hallucinations) in language models on legal questions, using different techniques to detect those hallucinations, and discussing the implications for use of AI in the legal domain.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a typology of legal hallucinations with three categories: closed-domain, open-domain with respect to the training corpus, and open-domain with respect to facts about the world. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these three categories and why distinguishing them is important? 

2. The paper uses both reference-based and reference-free querying approaches to estimate hallucination rates. Can you explain these two approaches in more detail, including their relative strengths and weaknesses? Why was using both approaches necessary?

3. For the reference-free querying, the paper relies on GPT-4 to detect contradictions between query responses. What steps were taken to validate GPT-4's reliability at identifying contradictions compared to human coders? What are the limitations of using GPT-4 in this way?

4. One of the key findings is that legal hallucinations are more common for lower courts compared to higher courts like the Supreme Court. Why might this be the case? What are the implications for using LLMs for different types of legal research? 

5. The analysis of hallucinations over time found that rates were lowest for post-War Warren Court cases. Does this suggest LLMs have particular difficulties with older and newer case law? Why might this be?

6. The paper argues there are inherent trade-offs between minimizing different types of hallucinations. Can you expand on this idea and discuss whether it is feasible to create LLMs optimized across all three categories simultaneously?  

7. What exactly does the expected calibration error (ECE) measure and why is it relevant? Were there any surprises in the ECE results found in this study? How might ECE be improved?

8. The discussion warns that overreliance on LLMs may create a kind of legal "monoculture" biased towards more prominent cases and jurisdictions. Can you elaborate on how this risk arises and how it might impact different groups of legal professionals?

9. One limitation mentioned is that the reference-free method can only establish a lower bound on the true hallucination rate. What other approaches could be used to obtain tighter estimates of the true hallucination rates for complex legal queries?

10. The paper argues LLMs may exacerbate rather than reduce inequalities in access to justice. Can you expand on this idea? Does this necessarily mean LLMs should be avoided for legal applications?
