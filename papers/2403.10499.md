# [Benchmarking Zero-Shot Robustness of Multimodal Foundation Models: A   Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating robustness of image classifiers is critical for real-world applications, especially safety-critical ones. While recent multimodal models like CLIP have shown promising zero-shot performance, their robustness is not well understood.

- Prior work has mainly tested robustness on natural distribution shifts, but comprehensive evaluation including synthetic corruptions and adversarial attacks is lacking. 

Methods & Contributions:

- The paper proposes a new robustness benchmark called RoZ spanning 7 natural shifts, 3 synthetic shifts and 11 attacks.

- Using RoZ, the authors evaluate robustness of zero-shot CLIP models. They consider multiple encoder architectures and an automatic prompt tuning method CLIP-Auto.

- On natural distribution shifts, CLIP matches or exceeds the robustness of supervised ResNet models, confirming prior findings. 

- However, CLIP models show significantly reduced robustness on synthetic / adversarial shifts compared to ResNets. For example, a 34.7% average drop under new typographic attacks.

- Analysis reveals the natural shift robustness may be partly attributed to dataset bias/overlap with web-scraped CLIP training data. 

- CLIP-Auto brings marginal gains, indicating robustness is limited by pre-trained representations rather than prompts.

Conclusion:

- The paper demonstrates the need for comprehensive robustness evaluation of multimodal models before real-world deployment. The proposed RoZ benchmark enables this analysis.

- There is significant room for improving robustness of models like CLIP to synthetic corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding if robustness can transfer from natural to synthetic shifts is an open question.

In summary, the key contribution is a new rigorous benchmark highlighting robustness gaps in zero-shot vision models, opening up directions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive robustness benchmark for evaluating zero-shot image classifiers like CLIP, showing that while CLIP demonstrates some robustness to natural distribution shifts, likely partly due to data overlap, it performs significantly worse than supervised models on synthetic distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors construct a comprehensive robustness benchmark called RoZ (Robustness on Zero-shot) to systematically evaluate the robustness of multimodal foundation models on image classification tasks. The benchmark includes test sets covering 7 natural distribution shifts, 3 synthetic distribution shifts, and 11 adversarial attacks.

2) Using the RoZ benchmark, the authors evaluate the robustness of the state-of-the-art zero-shot multimodal model CLIP. They consider different vision encoders in CLIP as well as a modified version CLIP-Auto with automatic prompt generation. 

3) Through extensive evaluations, the authors show that while CLIP demonstrates some robustness on natural distribution shifts, this could be partly attributed to data overlap in the pre-training set. On synthetic distribution shifts and adversarial attacks, CLIP does not improve robustness over supervised ImageNet models, and is especially vulnerable to a new typographic attack test set introduced in the paper.  

4) The comprehensive analysis indicates there is significant room for improving robustness of multimodal models. The authors' benchmark and findings can foster further research into this direction.

In summary, the main contribution is the construction of a robustness benchmark for multimodal models, and the extensive analysis highlighting the limitations of state-of-the-art models, which points to an important direction for future work.

The paper presents a comprehensive robustness benchmark called RoZ to evaluate the zero-shot robustness of multimodal foundation models, using CLIP as a case study. It tests CLIP's robustness across different distribution shifts and adversarial attacks, including new test sets ImageNet-T and CIFAR-10-T based on typographic attacks. The analysis shows CLIP's robustness deficiencies compared to supervised models, and that its robustness on natural distribution shifts may partially stem from data overlap in pre-training. Overall, the key focus is on rigorously benchmarking and understanding the zero-shot robustness of models like CLIP across different test scenarios.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes CLIP-Auto to automatically generate prompts for CLIP. How does the prompt search process work in CLIP-Auto? What is the objective function being optimized?

2. The paper evaluates robustness using effective robustness and relative robustness metrics. Can you explain the difference between these two metrics and why both are important to consider? 

3. Typographic attacks are used to create the new ImageNet-T and CIFAR-10-T datasets. What is the key idea behind typographic attacks and why are they particularly problematic for multimodal models like CLIP?

4. The paper finds that CLIP-Auto does not significantly improve robustness over default CLIP. What factors limit the impact of learned prompts on robustness for these multimodal models?

5. Data overlap between the pre-training set and test sets is analyzed in the paper. Can you describe the deduplication process used? Why is this analysis important when evaluating robustness?

6. On natural distribution shifts, CLIP demonstrates improved robustness over ImageNet models. However, the paper hypothesizes this may be partly attributed to data overlap. Explain why synthetic distribution shifts provide a more rigorous test in this case.  

7. The vision encoders in CLIP come from supervised ImageNet models. How might this impact the robustness results observed compared to an encoder trained only on web data?

8. Typographic attacks reduce performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. What does this suggest about the robustness of CLIP's learned representations? 

9. The paper focuses on evaluating CLIP models. What other recent multimodal models would be good to benchmark using the proposed RoZ framework?

10. What directions for improving robustness in zero-shot multimodal models seem most promising based on the analysis? What are some concrete ways the robustness could be improved?
