# [Identification of Regulatory Requirements Relevant to Business   Processes: A Comparative Study on Generative AI, Embedding-based Ranking,   Crowd and Expert-driven Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02986)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Organizations face challenges in ensuring compliance with increasing regulatory requirements from various sources. Identifying which parts of regulatory documents are relevant for which business processes is complex and mostly done manually by experts. This is tedious and costly. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Compare methods to aid experts in assessing regulatory text relevancy for business processes: 
  1) Embedding-based NLP ranking 
  2) Generative AI (GPT-4)
  3) Crowdsourcing
  4) Expert analysis (current standard)
- Evaluate feasibility of above methods to identify regulatory text relevance for 3 levels of business process detail. 
- Provide guidelines on which methods/combinations suit different application scenarios balancing aspects like automation, compliance, expert oversight.

Key Contributions:
- Public dataset with 2 real-world use cases: BPMN models, process descriptions, regulatory texts and gold standard relevancy labels
- Analysis of NLP ranking, generative AI, crowdsourcing and expert analysis for regulatory text relevance identification across process levels  
- Identification of strengths/weaknesses of methods regarding automation, transparency, reproducibility 
- Scenario-based recommendations on method combinations based on process characteristics like usage, impact, dynamics to maximize benefits

The study shows generative AI performs best for relevance identification but lacks transparency. Combinations with expert analysis are proposed based on process scenarios, balancing aspects like the need for automation vs. compliance. Overall, the analysis and guidelines contribute to improving regulatory compliance assessments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper compares four methods (expert analysis, state-of-the-art natural language processing, generative AI, and crowdsourcing) for identifying relevant regulatory requirements for business processes, evaluating them across different levels of process detail on two real-world case studies to provide guidelines on optimal method combinations based on application scenario characteristics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A publicly available data set with two real-world use cases as BPMN2.0 models, process descriptions on all three levels, and mapped open-access regulatory text passages with their relevancy labels for all process levels. This aims to facilitate further research in the area.

2. An analysis of the feasibility of state-of-the-art NLP methods, generative AI, and crowdsourcing to retrieve regulatory relevant texts in a complex legal and business setting for multiple levels of business process detail. 

3. An analysis of the capabilities of generative AI to answer questions about regulatory relevance in a complex legal and business setting for multiple levels of business process detail.

4. An analysis of the capabilities of crowdsourcing to identify relevancy in a complex legal and business setting for multiple levels of business process detail.

5. A novel approach for the identification of relevance for specific process aspects for natural language regulatory requirements, comparing multiple methods and possible combinations of these. This results in scenario-based application recommendations based on process characteristics.

In summary, the main contribution is a comparative study of multiple methods for identifying the relevance of regulatory texts for business processes at different levels of detail, along with guidelines on how these methods can be combined and applied based on application scenario characteristics.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Business process compliance
- Regulatory requirements
- Relevance identification
- Expert analysis
- Embedding-based ranking (SOTA NLP LIR)  
- Generative AI (GPT-4)
- Crowdsourcing
- Process models (BPMN2.0)
- Gold standard creation
- Accuracy, precision, recall evaluation
- Automation level
- Transparency and reproducibility 

The paper examines methods to assist experts in identifying regulatory requirements relevant for business processes, by comparing expert analysis, NLP ranking methods, generative AI, and crowdsourcing. It evaluates these methods quantitatively on metrics like accuracy and recall, and qualitatively on aspects like automation level, transparency and reproducibility. The methods are tested on real-world business process models and regulatory texts from domains like insurance and banking. Overall, the key focus is on developing semi-automated, hybrid human-AI approaches to regulatory compliance analysis for business processes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the key challenges faced by organizations in ensuring compliance of business processes with regulatory requirements according to the paper? How does the proposed approach aim to address these challenges?

2. What are the four methods compared in the study for identifying relevance of regulatory texts for business processes? Discuss the key strengths and weaknesses of each method.  

3. Explain the two dimensions - automation and transparency/reproducibility - based on which the four methods are analyzed. Why are these two dimensions particularly important for regulatory compliance assessments?

4. What are the three levels of detail used to analyze the relevance judgment feasibility? Why is it important to evaluate the methods at different levels of granularity? 

5. The paper categorizes regulatory documents into three groups based on their relevance. Explain these three groups and discuss why differentiating between them is useful.  

6. Discuss the prompt design used for the generative AI study. What are the key components and why are they important? How was the prompt iteratively improved?

7. Explain the two-phase design used for the crowd study. Why was such a design chosen over a simpler one-step annotation? What quality checks were implemented?

8. Compare and contrast the performance of the four methods across different metrics like accuracy, precision, recall etc. How does their performance vary across use cases and levels of detail?  

9. Discuss the limitations of the study from a data privacy perspective for closed access documents. How can this issue be mitigated?   

10. The paper provides recommendations for method combinations based on process characteristics. Pick two contrasting scenarios and explain which method combinations are suggested. Justify the recommendations.
