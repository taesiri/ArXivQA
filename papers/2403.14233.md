# [SoftPatch: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SoftPatch: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Noisy Data":

Problem:
- Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods assume clean training data and perform well in academic settings. However, in real-world applications, it is inevitable that noise sneaks into the training data, degrading performance.  
- Existing AD methods are susceptible to noisy training data due to their exhaustive modeling of the training set. Noisy samples can mislead overconfident AD algorithms to misclassify similar anomalies in the test set.
- Studying AD with noisy training data is an important practical problem but rarely investigated, especially for image sensory AD.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SoftPatch, a memory-based unsupervised AD method that handles noisy training data by denoising at the patch level and softening anomaly detection via re-weighting.
- Apply noise discriminators (nearest neighbor distance, multivariate Gaussian, local outlier factor) before coreset construction to assign outlier scores to each patch. Noisy patches are removed.
- Store outlier scores in the coreset memory bank to soften anomaly detection boundary. Outlier scores re-weight patch-level distances during test to down-weight noisy samples.

Main Contributions:
- First to focus on image sensory AD with noisy training data, a practical but overlooked setting. Show state-of-the-art methods degrade severely with noise.
- Propose patch-level denoising for higher data usage compared to sample-level denoising. Combine with soft re-weighting of coreset to improve noise robustness.
- Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and BTAD benchmarks demonstrate SoftPatch outperforms state-of-the-art in various noise settings. Sets strong baseline for further research into AD with noise.

In summary, the paper identifies an important practical gap in unsupervised anomaly detection research and proposes SoftPatch to address training data noise via patch-level denoising and softening of anomaly detection. Experiments validate the effectiveness of SoftPatch, outperforming prior art in noisy settings while maintaining competitiveness without noise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a memory-based unsupervised anomaly detection method called SoftPatch that efficiently denoises image data at the patch level to handle label-level noise in the training data, maintaining strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviating overconfidence issues compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It is the first work to focus on image sensory anomaly detection with noisy training data, which is a more practical but less studied setting. Previous methods assume clean training data which leads to performance degradation when noise exists.

2. It proposes a patch-level denoising strategy to eliminate noisy patches before coreset construction. This improves data usage compared to conventional sample-level denoising. Based on this, three noise discriminators are applied to strengthen model robustness.  

3. It sets a strong baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection with noisy data. The proposed method SoftPatch performs well in various noise settings and also comparable to state-of-the-art methods in general settings without additional noise. It provides a new perspective for further research on handling noise in anomaly detection.

In summary, the key innovation is studying the more practical but overlooked noisy training data problem in image sensory anomaly detection, and proposing patch-level solutions to improve model robustness. This expands the application scope and robustness of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms.

The paper focuses on the problem of noisy/corrupted training data in unsupervised anomaly detection, specifically for image sensory tasks like industrial defect detection. It proposes a patch-level denoising strategy to eliminate noisy patches from the training data and uses noise discriminators to assign outlier scores. These outlier scores are then used to softly re-weight the coreset examples stored in the memory bank during anomaly score calculation. This improves model robustness against noisy training data and avoids overconfidence in the cleanliness of the training set. Key goals are improving performance on real-world imperfect training data and enabling rapid deployment without data filtering.
