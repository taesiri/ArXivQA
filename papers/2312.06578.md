# [Multi-class Support Vector Machine with Maximizing Minimum Margin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06578)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-class support vector machine (SVM) method called M3SVM that maximizes the minimum margin between all class pairs. Motivated by the varying difficulty in distinguishing between different classes, the authors formulate an optimization objective that enlarges the lower bound of inter-class margins to ensure separation between even the most similar classes. Through convex approximation and constraint conversion, they derive a trainable objective function that balances overall margin enlargement with lower bound enhancement based on a tunable parameter p. The method provides a unified model that overcomes issues with existing multi-class SVM approaches like one-vs-rest and one-vs-one. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The concept further extends to softmax loss in neural networks, where the proposed ISM3 regularizer mitigates overfitting. The method offers strong theoretical justification from structural risk minimization along with geometric interpretability. By maximizing the minimum margin, it enhances inter-class discrimination for both traditional and deep classifiers.
