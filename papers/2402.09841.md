# [LAPDoc: Layout-Aware Prompting for Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Document understanding requires comprehending both text and layout. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities for language tasks but operate only on text input. In contrast, multi-modal document transformers are specifically designed to fuse text with layout but require extra training data and fine-tuning.

Solution:
- The paper explores an LLM-centric pipeline that enriches the textual document representation with layout information. Several "verbalization" strategies are proposed to convert visual layout and OCR output into text that can be fed into LLMs. The verbalized document text is combined with task prompts to solve tasks like question answering without model fine-tuning.

- Verbalization strategies like \verbAF and \verbAFY align text spatially using spaces and newlines to represent layout. Others encode layout more explicitly using XML-style tags. The approach works for documents with different layouts and languages.

- Experiments compare commercial (ChatGPT) and open-source (Solar) LLMs on document QA/NLI, table QA/NLI and key information extraction tasks using public benchmarks like DUE and proprietary industry datasets.

Contributions:
- A novel rule-based approach to enrich LLM prompts with spatial layout information from documents, requiring no extra training data or fine-tuning.
- Comprehensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrating improvements of up to 15% over layout-unaware prompts, achieving state-of-the-art on 2 datasets. 
- Analysis of limitations of current LLMs in interpreting document layout, using a manually annotated challenge subset of SROIE receipts.
- Discussion of efficiency issues regarding number of input tokens required for different verbalization strategies.

Conclusion:
- For structured documents making heavy use of spatial alignment, this LLM prompt enrichment approach rivals the performance of specialized multi-modal models without their training overhead. It should be considered as a strong alternative, especially for commercial applications.
