# [NIKI: Neural Inverse Kinematics with Invertible Neural Networks for 3D   Human Pose and Shape Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08590)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: 

How to improve the robustness of 3D human pose and shape estimation to occlusions, while maintaining pixel-aligned accuracy?

The key points are:

- Existing methods rely on either pixel-aligned local evidence or direct regression. Pixel-aligned approaches achieve high accuracy but are not robust to occlusions. Direct regression is more robust but suffers from image-mesh misalignment. 

- The authors propose NIKI, a neural inverse kinematics approach using invertible neural networks. It aims to combine the strengths of both types of methods.

- NIKI uses the bijective mapping of invertible networks to explicitly model errors in the inverse and forward kinematics processes. This allows decoupling errors from plausible poses to improve robustness, while maintaining sensitivity to reliable joints for alignment.

- The framework learns to map between joint space and rotation+error space bidirectionally. Boundary conditions are enforced for zero-error cases to retain accuracy.

- NIKI emulates analytical IK with a twist-and-swing decomposition for interpretability. It also incorporates temporal information for smooth motions.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling errors explicitly in both directions with invertible networks can achieve robustness to occlusions as well as pixel-aligned accuracy. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability of the proposed NIKI approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new approach called NIKI (Neural Inverse Kinematics algorithm with Invertible neural networks) for robust and accurate 3D human pose and shape estimation. The key ideas are:

- Using invertible neural networks (INNs) to model bi-directional errors in the forward and inverse kinematics processes. This allows decoupling errors from the human pose manifold to improve robustness, while maintaining sensitivity to non-occluded joints for accuracy.

- Training the INN jointly on forward and inverse kinematics to benefit from their inherent connection via bijective mapping. The deterministic forward process helps regularize the learning of the ill-posed inverse process. 

- Emulating analytical IK algorithms with a twist-and-swing decomposition for better interpretability, by using two consecutive INNs.

- Introducing zero-error boundary conditions during forward process training to enforce alignments with reliable joints.

- Modeling errors independently in the latent space during inverse training for robustness.

- Extending to the temporal domain for smooth motion prediction.

The approach is evaluated on several 3D pose datasets including a new proposed 3DPW-XOCC dataset with extreme occlusions. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both occluded and non-occluded scenarios, showing its robustness and accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel neural framework to unify the strengths of prior pixel-aligned (accuracy) and direct regression (robustness) approaches for human pose estimation using ideas of bi-directional error modeling, boundary constraints, and emulating analytical IK with INNs.
