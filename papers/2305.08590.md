# [NIKI: Neural Inverse Kinematics with Invertible Neural Networks for 3D   Human Pose and Shape Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08590)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: 

How to improve the robustness of 3D human pose and shape estimation to occlusions, while maintaining pixel-aligned accuracy?

The key points are:

- Existing methods rely on either pixel-aligned local evidence or direct regression. Pixel-aligned approaches achieve high accuracy but are not robust to occlusions. Direct regression is more robust but suffers from image-mesh misalignment. 

- The authors propose NIKI, a neural inverse kinematics approach using invertible neural networks. It aims to combine the strengths of both types of methods.

- NIKI uses the bijective mapping of invertible networks to explicitly model errors in the inverse and forward kinematics processes. This allows decoupling errors from plausible poses to improve robustness, while maintaining sensitivity to reliable joints for alignment.

- The framework learns to map between joint space and rotation+error space bidirectionally. Boundary conditions are enforced for zero-error cases to retain accuracy.

- NIKI emulates analytical IK with a twist-and-swing decomposition for interpretability. It also incorporates temporal information for smooth motions.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling errors explicitly in both directions with invertible networks can achieve robustness to occlusions as well as pixel-aligned accuracy. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability of the proposed NIKI approach.
