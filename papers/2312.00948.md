# [A Review of Communicating Robot Learning during Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a review of the interdisciplinary field of communicating robot learning back to human teachers during human-robot interaction. The key problem is that as robots become more intelligent and learn autonomously from human guidance, there is a growing gap between what the robot has actually learned and what the human thinks the robot has learned. Bridging this gap requires research at the intersection of robot learning algorithms, communication interfaces, and measurements of human-robot coordination.

The paper surveys recent trends in these three research branches. First, in terms of learning, robots can facilitate communication by involving the human in the learning loop to provide implicit feedback, or by intentionally processing their models to extract explicit human-friendly signals. Second, interfaces are moving beyond screens towards more immersive augmented reality and multi-modal haptic/auditory displays that convey information grounded in the task context. Finally, standardized questionnaires as well as physiological measurements are used to quantify changes in the human's situational awareness, workload, trust and task performance when robots communicate their learning.

Outcomes show that communicating robot learning leads to improved teaching from the human, increased trust in the robot, and human-robot co-adaptation. However, open questions remain regarding how to best represent robot learning for communication interfaces, how to design intuitive multi-modal interfaces, and how to accurately measure the human's understanding in real-time. 

The key contributions are:
1) Identifying research trends at the intersection of learning and communicating robot learning
2) Proposing open questions that must be solved before robots seamlessly convey their learning 
3) Conducting a user study that supports the benefit of communicating robot learning for improving human teaching and robot task performance

Overall, this paper provides a high-level overview of the state-of-the-art and future directions for enabling robots to effectively communicate their learning to human partners during interactive tasks.
