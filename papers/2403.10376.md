# [PASTA: Towards Flexible and Efficient HDR Imaging Via Progressively   Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Aligment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- HDR imaging aims to expand dynamic range and enhance visual quality compared to standard LDR images. A key challenge is accurately aligning and merging multiple LDR frames captured at different exposures, especially in the presence of movement and occlusion.
- Recent Transformer-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but have high computational complexity, struggling with high resolution images. There is a need to balance reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment (PASTA) framework for HDR imaging. 
- It utilizes discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to establish a hierarchical representation that captures information at different scales and resolutions. This representation enhances computational efficiency.
- A gradual fusion strategy is introduced to aggregate information across the hierarchy, capturing both local details and global context. It refines estimates progressively from low to high resolution.
- Two models are presented - PASTA-I uses temporal attention for implicit alignment while PASTA-U relies directly on hierarchical self-attention.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to fully utilize the capabilities of DWT hierarchical representation for efficient high-resolution HDR deghosting.
- Innovative use of channel attention and spatial self-attention to model statistical dependencies between subbands.
- Gradual fusion strategy to progressively aggregate multi-scale information from coarse to fine granularity.  
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks while significantly boosting efficiency - 3x speed up for 1080P images with 12GB GPU memory. Can process 2K images.
- Analysis of performance vs efficiency trade-off and effectiveness in handling occlusion and saturation.
