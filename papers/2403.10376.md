# [PASTA: Towards Flexible and Efficient HDR Imaging Via Progressively   Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Aligment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- HDR imaging aims to expand dynamic range and enhance visual quality compared to standard LDR images. A key challenge is accurately aligning and merging multiple LDR frames captured at different exposures, especially in the presence of movement and occlusion.
- Recent Transformer-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but have high computational complexity, struggling with high resolution images. There is a need to balance reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment (PASTA) framework for HDR imaging. 
- It utilizes discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to establish a hierarchical representation that captures information at different scales and resolutions. This representation enhances computational efficiency.
- A gradual fusion strategy is introduced to aggregate information across the hierarchy, capturing both local details and global context. It refines estimates progressively from low to high resolution.
- Two models are presented - PASTA-I uses temporal attention for implicit alignment while PASTA-U relies directly on hierarchical self-attention.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to fully utilize the capabilities of DWT hierarchical representation for efficient high-resolution HDR deghosting.
- Innovative use of channel attention and spatial self-attention to model statistical dependencies between subbands.
- Gradual fusion strategy to progressively aggregate multi-scale information from coarse to fine granularity.  
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks while significantly boosting efficiency - 3x speed up for 1080P images with 12GB GPU memory. Can process 2K images.
- Analysis of performance vs efficiency trade-off and effectiveness in handling occlusion and saturation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes PASTA, a novel and efficient HDR deghosting framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging hierarchical representation and progressive aggregation for implicit alignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel framework named Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment (PASTA) for HDR deghosting. Specifically:

1) PASTA achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency by utilizing hierarchical representation and progressive aggregation strategies. It significantly boosts the inference speed by 3-9 times compared to prior arts while achieving state-of-the-art results.

2) It is the first work that explores the potential of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as a hierarchical representation for high-resolution HDR deghosting. It innovatively incorporates channel attention and spatial self-attention to implicitly capture inter- and intra-scale relationships among DWT subbands. 

3) The progressive aggregation strategy effectively fuses information across different hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner to capture both local details and global context for ghost-free and high-fidelity HDR reconstruction.

4) Extensive experiments validate that PASTA sets new state-of-the-art records on benchmark HDR datasets and also demonstrates superior efficiency in terms of GPU memory usage and latency compared to existing methods.

In summary, the main contribution lies in the proposal of the PASTA framework to address the computational challenges of HDR deghosting and achieve an optimal efficiency-performance trade-off.
