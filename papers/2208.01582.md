# [ViP3D: End-to-end Visual Trajectory Prediction via 3D Agent Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to build an end-to-end pipeline for visual multi-agent trajectory prediction that can directly take raw sensory input and predict future trajectories, without relying on hand-designed perception modules and interfaces. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called ViP3D that leverages 3D agent queries as the main thread to connect different modules and enable end-to-end training and inference. The key hypothesis is that such a query-based visual prediction pipeline can better exploit useful visual information from raw images and videos, avoid error propagation across perception and prediction modules, and achieve improved trajectory forecasting performance.

In summary, the core research question is how to design an interpretable and fully differentiable pipeline from pixels to multi-agent trajectory prediction, and the hypothesis is that the proposed ViP3D framework with 3D agent queries as interfaces can achieve this goal and outperform traditional separated perception and prediction pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes ViP3D, a novel end-to-end visual trajectory prediction pipeline that leverages 3D agent queries to connect detection, tracking and prediction modules. 

2. ViP3D is the first fully differentiable vision-based approach for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. It can exploit rich visual information from raw images rather than rely on hand-picked features like past trajectories.

3. ViP3D outperforms traditional multi-stage pipelines and previous end-to-end models on trajectory prediction metrics. It demonstrates the benefits of the query-based end-to-end design.

4. The 3D agent queries make the pipeline interpretable and easy to debug. The model is also very concise by only using information from the current and previous frames.

In summary, this paper proposes an end-to-end query-based visual trajectory prediction pipeline that connects perception and prediction tightly. The novel design enables exploiting visual information better and achieves superior prediction performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes ViP3D, a novel end-to-end visual trajectory prediction pipeline that uses 3D agent queries as representations to enable query-based detection, tracking, and prediction directly from raw video frames while avoiding error propagation between modules.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of end-to-end visual trajectory prediction:

- The key innovation is using sparse 3D agent queries as the interface between different modules (detection, tracking, prediction), enabling fully end-to-end learning. Other works like IntentNet and PnPNet use features maps or bird's eye view representations which require non-differentiable post-processing.

- It demonstrates superior performance to traditional pipelines by effectively leveraging visual cues. This is a consistent trend in the field as end-to-end learning avoids error propagation across modules. 

- For visual inputs, it outperforms a modified PnPNet which uses the same visual detector. This shows the benefits of the query-based design over cropped feature map inputs for prediction.

- The query-based interface also enables compatibility with various trajectory prediction methods like regression, goal-based, heatmap-based. So the contributions are generalizable.

- One limitation is that performance depends a lot on the visual detection module. So adapting this to different detectors remains an open challenge.

- Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in end-to-end visual prediction by effectively fusing information across modules and time via 3D queries. The interface is unique compared to prior feature map based works. Results validate the design choices empirically.

In summary, this paper presents an important advancement in bridging the gap between perception and prediction modules in an end-to-end visual pipeline for autonomous driving. The query-based interface is a novel concept and the results demonstrate effectiveness. This is an incremental but meaningful step forward in the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my understanding, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Adapting ViP3D to different detection backbones. As discussed in the Experiments section, the performance of ViP3D's long-term inference is sensitive to the choice of detection backbone. The authors suggest more efforts are needed to make ViP3D compatible with different detectors, such as by training on longer scene segments with more frames.

2. Leveraging additional map information. The paper currently uses VectorNet to encode HD maps. The authors suggest exploring encoding more map information that may be useful for trajectory prediction, such as traffic light states, traffic signs, etc.

3. Exploring different trajectory decoding methods. ViP3D is compatible with various trajectory decoders like regression, goal, and heatmap-based methods. The authors suggest further exploring other advanced decoding methods to improve performance.

4. Scaling up to larger datasets. The experiments are currently conducted on nuScenes dataset. The authors suggest scaling up ViP3D to larger autonomous driving datasets to evaluate its effectiveness.

5. Deployment to real autonomous vehicles. The paper focuses on offline evaluation. The authors suggest future work on deploying ViP3D on real self-driving vehicles and studying challenges in real-world usage.

In summary, the main future directions are improving compatibility with detectors, incorporating more map information, scaling up the model, exploring new decoding methods, and deployment to real vehicles. The overall goal is to improve the vision-based end-to-end trajectory prediction performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes ViP3D, a novel end-to-end visual trajectory prediction pipeline for autonomous driving. ViP3D leverages a query-centric model design to predict future trajectories directly from raw multi-view video inputs. Specifically, ViP3D employs 3D agent queries as the main thread to detect, track, and predict agents throughout the pipeline. At each timestamp, a query-based detection module extracts multi-view image features to update the agent queries, forming tracked agent queries. Then a query-based prediction module takes the tracked queries as input, associates them with HD maps, and outputs predicted future trajectories. This query-centric design enables ViP3D to be fully differentiable, avoiding the error accumulation problem in traditional multi-stage pipelines. Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate that ViP3D outperforms previous methods by effectively utilizing fine-grained visual information. Qualitative results also showcase that ViP3D can leverage useful visual cues like turn signals to make more accurate predictions.

Overall, the key ideas and contributions of this paper are: (1) ViP3D is the first fully differentiable vision-based approach for trajectory prediction. (2) The query-centric design makes ViP3D interpretable and enables it to leverage rich visual information. (3) ViP3D demonstrates superior performance over previous methods on the nuScenes dataset. The end-to-end query-based architecture addresses limitations of prior work and provides a new direction for joint perception and prediction.
