# [ViP3D: End-to-end Visual Trajectory Prediction via 3D Agent Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01582)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to build an end-to-end pipeline for visual multi-agent trajectory prediction that can directly take raw sensory input and predict future trajectories, without relying on hand-designed perception modules and interfaces. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called ViP3D that leverages 3D agent queries as the main thread to connect different modules and enable end-to-end training and inference. The key hypothesis is that such a query-based visual prediction pipeline can better exploit useful visual information from raw images and videos, avoid error propagation across perception and prediction modules, and achieve improved trajectory forecasting performance.

In summary, the core research question is how to design an interpretable and fully differentiable pipeline from pixels to multi-agent trajectory prediction, and the hypothesis is that the proposed ViP3D framework with 3D agent queries as interfaces can achieve this goal and outperform traditional separated perception and prediction pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes ViP3D, a novel end-to-end visual trajectory prediction pipeline that leverages 3D agent queries to connect detection, tracking and prediction modules. 

2. ViP3D is the first fully differentiable vision-based approach for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. It can exploit rich visual information from raw images rather than rely on hand-picked features like past trajectories.

3. ViP3D outperforms traditional multi-stage pipelines and previous end-to-end models on trajectory prediction metrics. It demonstrates the benefits of the query-based end-to-end design.

4. The 3D agent queries make the pipeline interpretable and easy to debug. The model is also very concise by only using information from the current and previous frames.

In summary, this paper proposes an end-to-end query-based visual trajectory prediction pipeline that connects perception and prediction tightly. The novel design enables exploiting visual information better and achieves superior prediction performance.
