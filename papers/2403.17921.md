# [The Need for Speed: Pruning Transformers with One Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17921)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modern transformer architectures like BERT and ViT have enabled significant progress in domains like NLP and computer vision. However, they also have very high computational costs, posing challenges for adoption, especially on edge devices. Many prior works on compressing transformers have limitations like dependence on architecture specifics, expensive retraining procedures, or being focused only on a narrow set of tasks. There is a need for a general compression framework that works well across transformer architectures and application domains without requiring retraining.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes the OPTIN (One-shot Pruning Technique for Interchangeable Networks) framework for efficient compression of pre-trained transformers in a one-shot manner, without requiring retraining. OPTIN introduces a "trajectory" metric that measures the effect of pruning a weight on deeper layer embeddings and logits, capturing long-range dependencies to determine weight importance. The most unimportant weights are pruned to meet a FLOPs constraint. Intermediate feature distillation via manifold and KL divergence losses is used to compute trajectory. For vision models, token reduction is also incorporated.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes OPTIN, the first one-shot pruning method that generalizes across NLP and vision transformers without retraining
- Introduces the trajectory metric to capture long-term weight importance via distillation 
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on NLP benchmarks and image classification tasks with BERT and ViT models
- Shows strong performance even after aggressive pruning, e.g. retains 79.01% ImageNet accuracy for DeiT-Small at 23.7% FLOPs
- Demonstrates versatility across tasks like segmentation and CNNs, and with transfer learning
- Provides good speedups in inference throughput along with compression

The main impact is enabling efficient deployment of modern transformers without expensive retraining, with versatility across architectures, domains, and applications. This facilitates adoption in resource-constrained environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces OPTIN, a one-shot pruning technique to efficiently compress pre-trained transformer models across natural language, image, and other tasks without requiring retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing the OPTIN framework, which is a one-shot technique to efficiently compress pre-trained transformer models across multiple domains and tasks without requiring retraining. Specifically:

- OPTIN leverages a "trajectory" metric that captures the long-term inter-layer dependencies of model parameters to determine their importance for pruning. This allows it to better preserve performance compared to other pruning methods. 

- It demonstrates strong performance in compressing models for natural language processing, image classification, transfer learning, and semantic segmentation. For example, it shows competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art methods that do employ retraining, while not needing to retrain itself.

- It generalizes across multiple transformer architectures like BERT, DeiT, Swin Transformers, etc. as well as CNNs like VGGNet. This flexibility across domains and models is a key contribution.

- It can work in concert with existing methods like token pruning/merging to further improve efficiency of vision transformers.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing a general, flexible framework for efficiently compressing transformers in a one-shot manner, without architecture-specific design or retraining, while preserving accuracy across a diverse set of tasks.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called "trajectory" to measure the importance of parameters in a transformer model. How is this metric calculated? What are the key components and how do they capture the long-term inter-layer dependencies in the model?

3. The OPTIN framework is applied to both NLP and computer vision tasks. How is the trajectory metric adapted for vision transformers to account for tokens/patches? What changes were made to the loss formulations?

4. The paper shows experiments on transfer learning by first pruning ImageNet models and then fine-tuning them on CIFAR-10. What additional insights did this provide about the quality of parameters selected by OPTIN?

7. OPTIN is also extended to CNN models by adapting the trajectory metric. How specifically is the loss function modified for CNN feature channels? What results did it achieve on CIFAR-10 dataset?

8. What is the mask search algorithm used by OPTIN after computing the parameter importances? Why is it useful in efficiently searching the configuration space?

9. How do the results using OPTIN framework, without any retraining, compare with state-of-the-art methods that employ retraining? What does this imply about the parameter selection strategy?

10. The paper demonstrates OPTIN on a variety of transformer architectures like BERT, DeiT, ViT, Mask2Former etc. How do the results verify its applicability across diverse models and tasks? What is the average pruning time for these models?
