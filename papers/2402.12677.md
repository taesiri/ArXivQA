# [Object-level Geometric Structure Preserving for Natural Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing image stitching methods like GSP and GES-GSP are effective at aligning images and preventing distortion, but they have limitations in accurately capturing geometric structures and preserving relationships between these structures globally at the object level. They fail to comprehend overall shapes of objects and instead just focus on individual lines and curves.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an Object-level Geometric Structure Preserving (OBJ-GSP) image stitching algorithm that leverages semantic segmentation to extract meaningfully and uniformly distributed object-level geometric structures using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). It generates triangle meshes within each detected object and constrains them to undergo similarity transformations to preserve shapes globally. 

Key Contributions:

- Introduces semantic information into image stitching by using SAM to extract semantically meaningful and holistic object-level geometric structures instead of just individual lines and curves.

- Generates triangle meshes within objects detected by SAM and transforms them together as whole units to preserve overall object shapes globally instead of just individual structures.

- Establishes new state-of-the-art performance in image stitching on standard datasets, with 3.5% lower Mean Distorted Residuals and 3.8% lower NIQE score compared to previous best method GES-GSP.

- Qualitative results show OBJ-GSP better handles alignment and prevents distortion at both local structure and global object levels.

In summary, this paper presents an advanced image stitching algorithm called OBJ-GSP that leverages semantic segmentation and object-based shape preservation to achieve more natural and visually appealing panoramas that better align with human perception.
