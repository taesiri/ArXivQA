# [A Game of Bundle Adjustment -- Learning Efficient Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13270)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to accelerate the bundle adjustment process in order to make it more efficient for real-time applications like SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). 

The key hypothesis is that replacing the heuristic approach for choosing the damping factor lambda with a learned policy using reinforcement learning will allow more efficient weighting between the gradient descent and Gauss-Newton optimization steps. This should reduce the number of iterations required for bundle adjustment to converge.

In summary, the central hypothesis is:

Using reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy for choosing the damping factor lambda will accelerate bundle adjustment by reducing the number of iterations required to reach convergence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to accelerate the Bundle Adjustment (BA) process for Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn an efficient value for the damping factor lambda. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Viewing BA as a holistic process and formulating it as a RL problem, with the environment performing BA iterations and the agent choosing lambda. This allows handling the sparse and delayed reward of BA convergence.

- Using Soft Actor Critic (SAC), a RL algorithm suitable for continuous action spaces, to train an agent that selects good lambda values to minimize iterations to convergence.

- Demonstrating experimentally that the learned lambda selection reduces iterations by 3-5x on KITTI and BAL datasets compared to classic BA, leading to 2-3x speedup.

- Showing the agent can be trained on small synthetic scenes but still accelerate real-world problems, enabling efficient training.

- Integrating with other BA acceleration methods that reduce per-iteration time, demonstrating compatibility.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel way to formulate and accelerate BA using RL to learn efficient lambda selection, reducing iterations substantially. The results show promise for making BA more efficient for real-time SLAM applications.
