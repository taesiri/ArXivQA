# [Multi-task Image Restoration Guided By Robust DINO Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01677)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DINO-IR, a novel multi-task image restoration approach that leverages robust features from the pre-trained vision model DINOv2 to guide the restoration process. Motivated by the instability of existing multi-task methods as the number of tasks increases, the authors first demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that DINOv2 features are insensitive to various degradations like noise and blur while preserving semantic information. They then introduce specialized modules including Multi-Layer Semantic Fusion (MSF), DINO-Restore (D-R) adaption and fusion, and DINO Perception Contrastive (DPC) loss to effectively integrate DINOv2 features into the restoration framework. Extensive experiments validate that DINO-IR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across various tasks and metrics, and also exhibits enhanced robustness as evidenced by reduced performance degradation with more tasks. The work highlights the potential of using robust features from pre-trained models to stabilize multi-task image restoration.
