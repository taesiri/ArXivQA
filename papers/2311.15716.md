# [Justifiable Artificial Intelligence: Engineering Large Language Models   for Legal Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15716)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

In this paper, Wehnert argues that large language models (LLMs) have potential to be useful in the legal domain, but currently lack the transparency and explainability needed for legal experts to trust their outputs. She proposes an alternative approach called "Justifiable Artificial Intelligence" which focuses on providing evidence to justify the LLM's claims rather than explaining the LLM's reasoning process. The key idea is to have a retrieval module that can search for supporting and contradicting evidence from trustworthy sources regarding claims made by the LLM. This allows end users to validate the LLM's output themselves through a fact-checking process instead of relying on explanations from the opaque LLM. Wehnert contends this evidence-based approach would make legal experts more willing to utilize LLM assistants without compromising reliability. She connects this to existing research directions in legal LLMs and automated fact-checking. Overall, Wehnert makes a case for using LLMs to inform rather than influence users by enabling them to critically evaluate an LLM's viewpoint.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes the concept of "Justifiable Artificial Intelligence" as an alternative to "Explainable AI" for increasing trust in large language models in the legal domain, through providing supporting and contradicting evidence for the models' claims to enable human validation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is coining the term "Justifiable Artificial Intelligence" and proposing it as an alternative approach to Explainable AI for improving the trustworthiness and acceptance of large language models in the legal domain. 

Specifically, the paper defines Justifiable AI as providing evidence from trustworthy sources that supports or contradicts the outputs of an AI system, rather than requiring the AI itself to explain its reasoning. This gives users more transparency and control in validating the system's claims. 

The paper argues that current efforts in Explainable AI have not yet reached the level needed for legal experts to trust large language models. However, by focusing on justifying through evidence rather than explaining the models themselves, legal applications of AI could become more viable.

The paper also connects Justifiable AI to existing research in legal applications of LLMs and fact checking, analyzing the capabilities and limitations in these areas. It proposes two potential pipelines for implementing Justifiable AI systems in the legal domain.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing Justifiable AI as a new perspective focused on increasing the acceptability of AI in domains like law that demand explainability and transparency. This is proposed as an alternative path forward compared to solely pursuing explainable models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

- large language models 
- justifiable artificial intelligence
- fact-checking
- explainable artificial intelligence  
- information retrieval
- entailment classification

The paper coins the term "Justifiable Artificial Intelligence" to refer to an approach focused on providing evidence to justify or validate the outputs of large language models, rather than solely trying to explain how the models work internally. Key ideas include using additional modules like fact-checking or information retrieval to find supporting and contradicting evidence for claims made by the AI system. The goal is to make the system more trustworthy for domains like law that demand reliability, without needing full transparency into the model itself. So justifiability rather than explainability is the focus.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Justifiable AI instead of Explainable AI for legal applications of large language models. What are the key differences between these two approaches and why does the author argue Justifiable AI is more suitable?

2. The pipeline in Figure 2 shows a fact-checking based approach to justify an LLM's output. Explain the steps in detail and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. What components would be critical for this to work effectively?  

3. The author argues LLMs currently lack capabilities like recency, accuracy, coherence etc. to be fully trusted in the legal domain. Even with the Justifiable AI approach, what fundamental limitations around these aspects would remain and how could they be addressed?

4. The paper discusses using evidence for and against an LLM's claim to avoid confirmation bias. How exactly would the retrieval module obtain evidence against a claim? What are some challenges in doing this automatically?

5. Some legal reasoning tasks require complex, multi-step logical inferences. Given the limitations discussed in current LLMs, would the Justifiable AI approach be sufficient for effectively assisting in such complex reasoning? Why or why not?

6. The paper focuses on using textual evidence to justify claims. Could other modalities like images also play a role? What would be some major legal considerations in using images as evidence?

7. The author discusses manual validation still being necessary with Justifiable AI. Realistically, how much effort would be reduced for human experts compared to fully manual analysis? How could this be quantified?  

8. For legal applications, what should the criteria be to determine if the justification provided by the system is sufficient before a human decision is made based on it?

9. The paper proposes that in Justifiable AI the LLM assists by providing different perspectives to users. How specifically would opposing viewpoints be generated and framed to avoid bias?

10. What legal domains beyond case law might be good candidates for applying Justifiable AI? What aspects would need to be customized in the approach for different domains?
