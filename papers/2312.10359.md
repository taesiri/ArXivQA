# [Conformer-Based Speech Recognition On Extreme Edge-Computing Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Running advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Conformer CTC on resource-constrained devices like smartphones and wearables is challenging due to limitations in compute capabilities, memory, and energy consumption.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply a series of optimizations to fit Conformer CTC models onto resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy, including:
  - Memory-aware graph execution using techniques like tensor reshape, splitting, Einstein summation to minimize expensive memory copies.
  - Numerical stabilization of layer normalization using proposed optimal pre-normalizer theory to prevent underflows/overflows on low-precision hardware.  
  - Conditional re-scaling of softmax to enable small lookup tables.
- Replace regular 2D convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions which reduces compute intensity.
- Derive theory to optimally stabilize layer norm for any Lp-norm in any floating point precision without retraining.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate Conformer CTC models can run faster than real-time (0.19 real-time factor) on wearables with state-of-the-art accuracy after optimizations.
- Achieve over 5x speedup and 10x energy savings on wearables compared to CPU.
- Propose complete theory for optimal pre-normalizers to stabilize layer norm in any Lp-norm and floating point precision.
- Show depthwise separable convolutions help minimize chance of overflow versus regular convolutions.
- Techniques are widely applicable for deploying other transformer models on edge devices.

The key innovations are architectural adaptations, software-based graph transformations, and new mathematical theory to enable accurate and fast speech recognition fully on device without sacrificing user experience.
