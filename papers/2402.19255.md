# [GSM-Plus: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of   LLMs as Mathematical Problem Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are debates on whether large language models (LLMs) truly understand mathematical concepts or rely on superficial patterns when solving math word problems. 
- One concern is that LLMs can make mistakes on slightly modified math questions that humans would not.
- This motivates the need for a more rigorous benchmark to systematically evaluate the robustness of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the adversarial grade school math (GSM-Plus) dataset, an extension of the GSM8K dataset with various mathematical perturbations. 
- Eight types of perturbations are designed based on numerical variation, arithmetic variation, problem understanding, distractor insertion and critical thinking.
- By testing LLMs on GSM8K questions and their perturbed variants in GSM-Plus, the robustness of mathematical reasoning can be assessed.

Experiments and Results:  
- Experiments were conducted on 25 LLMs using 4 popular prompting techniques.
- Although LLMs exhibit strong performance on GSM8K, their accuracy substantially drops on GSM-Plus.
- LLMs especially struggle with critical thinking, arithmetic variation and distractor insertion questions.
- None of the prompting techniques can fully address the lack of reasoning robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the GSM-Plus benchmark containing over 10k questions systematically constructed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.
- Extensive experiments and analysis quantifying model capabilities and limitations in solving perturbed math word problems.  
- Exploration of compositional prompting to iteratively generate and verify reasoning steps, showing improvements but not fully bridging performance gaps.

In summary, the paper provides a rigorous benchmark and evaluation methodology to understand the limitations of current LLMs, sets a direction for developing more robust math reasoning models in future work.
