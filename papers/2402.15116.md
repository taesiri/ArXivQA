# [Large Multimodal Agents: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities when integrated into AI agents for decision-making and reasoning. However, most existing LLM-powered agents focus solely on textual data and lack the ability to handle multimodal inputs.  
- There is an emerging research trend on extending LLM agents into the multimodal domain, which enables them to interpret and respond to more diverse user queries. This gives rise to "large multimodal agents" (LMAs).

Solution:
- The paper systematically reviews research on LMAs, including their key components (perception, planning, action and memory), taxonomy of current studies, collaborative frameworks, evaluation methodologies, and applications.

Components:
- Perception: LMAs extract information from various modalities (text, images, videos, audio) to enhance understanding of the environment. 
- Planning: LLMs serve as the "brain" of LMAs for reasoning and planning to achieve goals. The planning capability is analyzed in terms of model, format, reflection and methods.
- Action: Translating plans into tool use, physical embodied actions or virtual actions to interact with the environment.  
- Memory: Incorporating long-term and short term memory enhances LMAs' generalization and lifelong learning abilities.

Taxonomy:
- Type I: Closed-source LLMs as planners without long-term memory
- Type II: Finetuned open-source LLM planners without long-term memory  
- Type III: Planners with indirect access to long-term memory via tools
- Type IV: Planners with direct/native access to long-term multimodal memory

Evaluation: 
- Subjective (based on human judgment) and objective (quantitative metrics) evaluation of LMAs are summarized, covering versatility, user-friendliness, scalability and safety.
- Benchmarks for standardized assessment of LMAs are discussed.

Applications:
- The paper highlights applications of LMAs in GUI automation, robotics, gaming, autonomous driving, video/audio understanding and generation.

Contributions:  
- First paper to systematically review the emerging area of LMAs
- Analyzes components, proposes taxonomy, summarizes evaluation methods and applications of LMAs
- Compiles an up-to-date resource list for multimodal AI agents research

The paper serves as a guide for future development of more intelligent, adaptive and human-like multimodal AI agents. Possible future research directions are discussed at the end.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest research on large language model-powered multimodal agents, summarizing their core components, taxonomy, collaborative frameworks, evaluation methodologies, applications, and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a systematic review of the latest research on large language model (LLM) driven multimodal agents, referred to as large multimodal agents (LMAs). The paper introduces the key components of LMAs - perception, planning, action, and memory - and categorizes existing studies into four types based on their architectures.

2. It summarizes the collaborative frameworks that integrate multiple LMAs to enhance collective efficacy in completing tasks. Two types of multi-agent frameworks are discussed.

3. It compiles the diverse evaluation methodologies used to assess LMAs and establishes a comprehensive framework to standardize evaluations. This aims to enable more meaningful comparisons across different LMAs.  

4. It highlights the broad range of real-world applications where LMAs can be impactful, such as GUI automation, robotics, game development, autonomous driving, video and audio understanding.

5. It concludes by discussing limitations of current research and suggesting promising future directions, including developing more unified single agent systems, establishing systematic evaluation benchmarks, and expanding applications at the intersection with human-computer interaction.

In summary, this paper provides a holistic overview of the emerging field of LMAs, identifies key research gaps, and offers insights to guide future work towards building more capable and generalizable multimodal AI agents.
