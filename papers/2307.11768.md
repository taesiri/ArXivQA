# [Question Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11768)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate reasoning by decomposing questions into simpler subquestions lead to more faithful reasoning explanations compared to other methods like chain of thought (CoT) prompting?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Yes, decomposition-based prompting methods like factored decomposition and chain-of-thought decomposition can improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over CoT prompting, while still achieving competitive task performance.

In particular, the paper seems focused on evaluating whether decomposition-based prompting strategies can:

1) Reduce biased reasoning, where models rely on unstated biases rather than only the reasoning they generate.

2) Reduce ignored reasoning, where models do not change their answers when their stated reasoning is altered. 

The paper tests the hypothesis by comparing CoT prompting to chain-of-thought decomposition and factored decomposition across question-answering tasks using metrics adapted from recent work on reasoning faithfulness. The results suggest decomposition methods can improve faithfulness while maintaining good performance.

So in summary, the central research question is assessing if decomposition-based prompting can improve reasoning faithfulness over CoT, and the hypothesis is that methods like factored decomposition can achieve this. The paper aims to test this hypothesis across several question-answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper explores different methods for prompting large language models to generate explanatory reasoning when answering questions, in order to produce reasoning that faithfully reflects the model's actual thought process. The main contribution is showing that prompting the model to decompose questions into simpler subquestions before answering tends to produce more faithful reasoning compared to directly prompting for step-by-step reasoning (chain of thought). 

Specifically, the paper demonstrates that "factored decomposition", where each subquestion is answered independently in a separate context, generates the most faithful reasoning as measured by several metrics. This method reduces the amount of ignored and biased reasoning compared to chain of thought. Meanwhile, "chain-of-thought decomposition" is shown to be an effective intermediate approach that produces more faithful reasoning than chain of thought while maintaining competitive question-answering performance.

Overall, the key contribution is providing evidence that question decomposition techniques can improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over standard chain of thought prompting. This suggests it may be possible to develop methods that produce reasoning that accurately represents a model's internal process, which could enable safer deployment of large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Unfortunately without access to the full text of the paper, I do not have enough context to provide a meaningful one-sentence summary. Academic papers often contain nuanced details and arguments that are difficult to condense into a single sentence. If you could provide more information about the paper topic, research questions, methodology, and key findings, I may be able to attempt a brief summarization. But in general, most academic papers require more than one sentence to accurately capture the main points. The abstract section is usually a good starting point for getting a high-level overview of a paper if available.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is an analysis comparing this paper to other research in the same field:

The paper presents a method for improving the faithfulness of reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) when answering questions. It focuses on using question decomposition strategies like chain-of-thought decomposition and factored decomposition to elicit more faithful explanations from LLMs. 

This connects to an active area of research on improving the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Prior work has identified issues with common methods like chain of thought (CoT) reasoning, finding CoT can be ignored by models or fail to reflect biases in model predictions. The paper cites relevant studies by Turpin et al. (2023) and Lanham et al. (2023) that demonstrate these limitations.

The approach taken is novel compared to prior work on faithfulness. While some studies have proposed training objectives or modifications to model architectures, this paper prompts existing LLMs differently. Using decomposition improves faithfulness without retraining models.

The analysis of different prompting strategies on faithfulness metrics is more comprehensive than prior work. The paper examines multiple ways to elicit reasoning (CoT, CoT decomposition, factored decomposition), instead of just CoT. It also adapts multiple recently proposed faithfulness metrics, whereas related work often focuses on just one or two metrics.

Overall, this paper makes a useful contribution to the field. It demonstrates concrete gains in reasoning faithfulness from a simple but novel prompting approach. The analysis is also more robust than prior work thanks to evaluating more prompting strategies and a wider range of faithfulness metrics. The findings suggest promising directions for improving faithfulness without extensive model retraining or modifications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:

- Exploring other methods beyond chain of thought and question decomposition that could improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning. The paper focuses on comparing chain of thought to decomposition-based methods, but is open to other approaches that may emerge.

- Further training models specifically to generate more faithful reasoning, for example by training to solve problems via decomposition or training to generate consistent reasoning across related inputs. The authors suggest this could lead to additional gains beyond what they observed by just prompting for decomposition.

- Validating whether more faithful reasoning enables detecting undesirable behaviors in models, which is posed as an important motivation. The paper does not directly test if more faithful reasoning catches issues better.

- Evaluating on a more diverse set of models and tasks beyond the ones studied. The authors acknowledge their results may not generalize and suggest expanding the evaluation scope.

- Developing better tools for quantitatively assessing reasoning faithfulness, perhaps based on mechanistic understanding of models. The authors recognize limits of current faithfulness metrics.

- Exploring the tradeoffs between performance and faithfulness further, for example with additional training. The decomposition methods improve faithfulness but reduce performance.

In summary, the main suggestions are around developing new techniques to improve faithfulness, expanded evaluation, developing better faithfulness metrics, studying performance/faithfulness tradeoffs, and validating whether more faithful reasoning enables oversight. The authors frame faithfulness as an important open problem.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates methods to improve the faithfulness of reasoning generated by large language models when answering questions. It focuses on prompting strategies like chain of thought, chain-of-thought decomposition, and factored decomposition. The key finding is that decomposition-based prompting strategies which break down questions into subquestions answered independently can generate more faithful reasoning while maintaining good performance on question answering. In particular, factored decomposition answers each subquestion in isolated contexts, reducing the potential for biased or ignored reasoning. Experiments show decomposition methods mitigate biased reasoning from contextual biases and lead to reasoning that is less ignored by the model when predicting final answers. The results suggest prompting via decomposition improves reasoning faithfulness over chain of thought, while still approaching chain of thought's performance, indicating promise for eliciting more reliable reasoning from large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates methods for improving the faithfulness of reasoning generated by large language models when answering questions. The authors highlight issues with the faithfulness of "chain of thought" reasoning, where models generate step-by-step reasoning before providing a final answer. They find this reasoning can often be biased or ignored by the model when generating its final answer. 

To address these issues, the authors explore prompting the model to decompose questions into simpler subquestions before answering, rather than directly generating reasoning. They compare two decomposition methods - chain-of-thought decomposition and factored decomposition. The results demonstrate these decomposition methods lead to more faithful reasoning, with less bias and less tendency for the model to ignore the reasoning when answering. Factored decomposition in particular, which uses isolated contexts to answer subquestions, generates the most faithful reasoning. However, it comes at a cost to question-answering performance compared to chain of thought. The authors conclude that question decomposition is a promising approach for improving reasoning faithfulness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores using question decomposition as a way to prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate more faithful reasoning when answering questions. The authors compare three approaches - chain of thought (CoT), chain-of-thought decomposition (CoT decomposition), and factored decomposition. CoT involves prompting the LLM to generate step-by-step reasoning before predicting an answer. CoT decomposition is similar but enforces a subquestion-subanswer format for the reasoning steps. Factored decomposition also uses subquestions but answers each one independently before combining to get the final answer. The key difference is that factored decomposition reduces the context available when answering each subquestion, which may reduce biased or ignored reasoning. The authors evaluate the methods on question answering performance and recently proposed faithfulness metrics. The results show factored decomposition generates the most faithful reasoning, while CoT decomposition is an intermediate between CoT and factored in terms of both performance and faithfulness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 It looks like this paper is exploring different methods for prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate explanatory reasoning when answering questions. Specifically, it seems focused on assessing whether these different prompting strategies can elicit reasoning from LLMs that faithfully reflects the model's actual reasoning process. 

The key methods explored are:

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Prompting the LLM to generate step-by-step reasoning before providing a final answer to a question.

- Chain-of-Thought decomposition (CoT decomposition): Similar to CoT but structuring the reasoning specifically as answering a sequence of subquestions. 

- Factored decomposition: Decomposing the question into subquestions, answering each subquestion independently, then using those subanswers to answer the original question.

The paper evaluates these methods along two main dimensions:

1. Question-answering performance: How accurately the LLM can answer questions when prompted with each strategy.

2. Reasoning faithfulness: Using metrics proposed in prior work, how well the generated reasoning reflects the actual reasoning process of the LLM.

The key research question seems to be assessing whether the decomposition-based prompting strategies can improve reasoning faithfulness over standard CoT prompting, while maintaining strong question-answering performance. The results suggest decomposition methods, especially factored decomposition, do provide gains in faithfulness while achieving reasonable performance.

In summary, this paper explores prompting strategies to improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning for question answering. The core problem is obtaining reasoning from LLMs that accurately reflects their internal reasoning process.
