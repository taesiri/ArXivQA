# [Using Large Language Models for Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04528)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO). The authors propose an iterative approach where an LLM is prompted with the problem description and search space, then outputs a hyperparameter configuration to evaluate. The environment trains a model using those hyperparameters, returns a validation metric like loss, and the process repeats to optimize the loss. Experiments optimize 2D landscapes and standard HPO benchmarks with small budgets (10 evaluations), finding LLMs can match or exceed performance of methods like Bayesian optimization and random search. Notably, the paper treats model code itself as a hyperparameter, prompting an LLM to generate PyTorch code. With only 5 iterations, this code generation approach outperforms alternatives, effectively automating ML pipeline setup. While context length limits prompt complexity, the research indicates LLMs' promise for improving efficiency in hyperparameter decision processes. Dialogue experiments also showcase interactive LLM assistance for model debugging and tuning.
