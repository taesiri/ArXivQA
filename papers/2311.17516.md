# [MMA-Diffusion: MultiModal Attack on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17516)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MMA-Diffusion, a multimodal attack framework that effectively circumvents prompt filters and post-synthesis safety checkers to generate inappropriate images in text-to-image models, highlighting vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 This paper introduces MMA-Diffusion, a multimodal attack framework to generate inappropriate/NSFW content and bypass defenses in text-to-image models. Based on my review, the key terms associated with this paper include:

- MMA-Diffusion: The proposed multimodal attack framework that uses both text and image perturbations to circumvent prompt filters and safety checkers in text-to-image models.

- Adversarial attack: Crafting inputs like text prompts or image perturbations to cause models to make mistakes or behave incorrectly. 

- Text-to-image (T2I): Generative models that synthesize images from text descriptions. Examples are Stable Diffusion, Midjourney.

- Not safe for work (NSFW): Inappropriate or explicit content that is deemed unsafe/unsuitable for work environments. 

- Prompt engineering: Carefully manipulating the text prompts provided to generative models in order to influence the generated content.

- Safety checkers: Additional components built into generative models to detect potential NSFW content before showing users.

- Multimodal attacks: Adversarial attacks that leverage both textual and visual modalities, as done in MMA-Diffusion.
