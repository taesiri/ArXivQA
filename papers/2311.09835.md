# [ML-Bench: Large Language Models Leverage Open-source Libraries for   Machine Learning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09835)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes ML-Bench, a new benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models to leverage existing libraries and accomplish machine learning tasks by generating executable code based on instructions and documentation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ML-Bench, a new benchmark dataset to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to leverage existing libraries and accomplish machine learning tasks. The key idea is that real-world programming relies heavily on using pre-existing code libraries rather than writing everything from scratch. So instead of evaluating LLMs on pure code generation, ML-Bench tests their skill at using functions from open-source libraries to solve tasks. The benchmark consists of over 10,000 samples covering 130 tasks across 14 popular ML GitHub repositories. Given a task instruction and README, the LLM must generate executable code using the library. This requires comprehending documentation and complex code structures. Results show GPT-4 substantially outperforms other LLMs, but still only solves 39.73% of tasks, indicating major room for improvement. The authors propose ML-Agent, built on GPT-4, to effectively navigate codebases, find docs, retrieve code, and generate executable programs. Empirical results show ML-Agent leads to further gains. Overall, ML-Bench introduces a challenging but practical new setup to assess how well LLMs can leverage real-world libraries for ML tasks. The proposed ML-Agent also demonstrates how we can design agents tailored for this programming paradigm.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes ML-Bench, a new benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in leveraging existing functions in open-source libraries to accomplish machine learning tasks. ML-Bench consists of over 10,000 samples spanning 130 tasks across 14 major ML GitHub repositories. Given a specific ML task instruction and README, the LLM must generate executable code using the repository's functions to fulfill the task requirements. This introduces new challenges of long-text comprehension and complex code navigation. Experiments show GPT-4 significantly outperforms other LLMs, but still only solves 39.73% of tasks, highlighting major room for improvement. The authors propose ML-Agent, built on GPT-4, to address limitations like inactive retrieval, data processing discrepancies, insufficient domain knowledge, and limited context windows. ML-Agent incorporates active retrieval, sorting, planning, and generation modules to better leverage repositories. Results show ML-Agent achieves further improvements in task completion over GPT-4 alone. The benchmark and agent contribute new means of evaluating and enhancing LLM proficiency in practical ML scenarios relying on libraries.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How effective are large language models at leveraging existing functions in open-source libraries to accomplish machine learning tasks, compared to writing code completely from scratch?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Large language models can more effectively accomplish machine learning tasks by utilizing existing functions and resources in open-source libraries, instead of generating all code from scratch.

The paper seems to test this hypothesis by:

1) Proposing a new benchmark, ML-Bench, that evaluates LLMs on their ability to use open-source libraries for ML tasks.

2) Developing ML-Agent, an agent designed to navigate codebases and generate executable code using libraries. 

3) Evaluating various LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, and CodeLlama on the ML-Bench benchmark in different settings.

4) Comparing LLMs' performance when using libraries versus generating from scratch.

5) Showing that leveraging libraries leads to better performance on ML tasks compared to scratch generation.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that LLMs can more effectively accomplish ML tasks by using libraries rather than generating everything from scratch. The ML-Bench benchmark and experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

- A few recent papers have started exploring LLMs' usage of APIs and libraries, but on a smaller scale or without a full benchmark (e.g. ToolLLM, RepoCoder). This paper provides a much more comprehensive evaluation.

Novelty
- The key novelty of this paper is the creation of ML-Bench, which is the first large-scale benchmark targeting LLMs' ability to use ML libraries for full tasks.

- It collects data systematically from 14 major ML code repositories on GitHub through a pipeline. The pipeline and dataset construction is innovative.

- The paper also proposes a novel agent, ML-Agent, designed specifically for this library usage task, which is not explored in other works.

Methods
- This paper tests several state-of-the-art LLMs like Codex, AlphaCode, and GPT-3 as baselines, similar to other benchmarks.

- It also fine-tunes an open-source model CodeLlama on the new benchmark as another baseline.

- The proposed ML-Agent incorporates specialized modules like a retriever and evaluator for library usage. Other works do not explore such specialized agents.

- Evaluation metrics like Pass@K and Parameter Hit are tailored for this task, unlike generic metrics used in other benchmarks.

Overall, this paper pushes research forward in evaluating LLMs for practical library usage for ML, an important real-world task that has not received sufficient focus earlier. The benchmark and agent are valuable contributions that enable standardized evaluation on this task going forward.
