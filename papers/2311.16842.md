# [RELIC: Investigating Large Language Model Responses using   Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16842)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an interactive system called RELIC that helps users identify and correct potential inaccuracies or hallucinations in text generated by large language models (LLMs). The core idea is to assess an LLM's confidence in the generated text by analyzing the consistency between multiple samples generated from the same prompt. The paper presents a computational pipeline that breaks down long-form text into atomic claims and uses natural language inference to check if each claim is supported or contradicted across samples. To link this confidence assessment with evidence, the system automatically generates natural language questions from claims, answers them using the samples, and clusters semantically equivalent answers. The interface allows users to inspect annotated keywords, filter claims, view passage evidence, and conduct what-if analyses by editing text. Through a user study with 10 participants, the paper demonstrates RELIC's effectiveness in enabling users to verify and steer unreliable LLM-generated information. Key innovations include measuring confidence at the semantic level via self-consistency, interactively linking confidence judgments with textual evidence, and providing visual summaries and editable views to support user workflows for validating AI-generated text.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes RELIC, an interactive system to help users identify and correct inaccurate information in text generated by large language models by understanding semantic-level consistency across multiple model responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The paper highlights three main contributions:

1. A Formative Study illustrating the shortcomings of current LLM interfaces in indicating the reliability level of generated text and helping form requirements for designing a user-centered NLG verification system.

2. \system, an Interactive System that helps users verify and steer NLG outputs from language models by investigating the factual consistency of multiple samples.

3. A User Evaluation with ten participants demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and bringing insights for future human-LLM interaction studies.

The paper proposes an interactive system called RELIC to help users identify and correct potential inaccuracies or hallucinations in text generated by large language models. The core idea is to assess the self-consistency of multiple samples from the LLM to estimate confidence in individual claims. Key aspects include breaking down generated text into atomic claims, turning claims into natural language questions to retrieve answers/evidence from additional samples, clustering semantically equivalent answers, and presenting this information on model confidence to users through interactive visualizations to enable validation and correction of the generated text. The paper also includes the results of a formative study with LLM users and a usability evaluation of the RELIC system with 10 participants.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed approach measure the semantic-level confidence of the generated text rather than relying solely on token-level probabilities? What are the benefits of assessing confidence at the semantic level?

2. Why is it important to scale the approach to handle long-form text generations instead of just short responses? How does the method breakdown long-form text into atomic claims to enable more granular analysis? 

3. Explain the rationale behind using natural language questions generated from the atomic claims to retrieve supporting or contradicting answers from the additional samples. What are the advantages of this evidence-driven approach?

4. Walk through the computational pipeline step-by-step, from generating multiple samples from the language model to clustering the answers into groups. What NLP techniques are utilized at each stage?

5. What visual encodings and interactions does the Response View provide to help users verify the generated text? How do features like Keyword Annotation and Brushing for Questioning work?

6. How does the Claim View display the proportions of supporting, contradicting and neutral samples for each atomic claim? How is it linked to the Response View to provide context?

7. Explain how users can interactively query evidence through the Evidence View by selecting keyword options or claims. How does it support inspection of alternatives?

8. Discuss how the ability to edit the generated text and view updated consistency annotations enables what-if analysis. How can this interactivity help steer unreliable information?

9. Analyze the results of the quantitative evaluation using the consistency score to detect inaccurate atomic claims. What trends do you observe regarding sample size and model choice?

10. Categorize and discuss the common failure cases and error types that occur even when consistency scores are high. What limitations does this reveal about consistency-based verification?
