# [How do Hyenas deal with Human Speech? Speech Recognition and Translation   with ConfHyena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Attention mechanisms are very computationally expensive for processing long speech sequences in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) models. The quadratic complexity of attention to input length causes high training costs and hinders adoption. Existing sub-quadratic alternatives achieve efficiency at the cost of quality degradation.  

Proposed Solution: 

1) Introduce ConfHyena, a Conformer model replacing self-attention with non-causal Hyena operators to enable access to full context. 

2) Propose Hybrid ConfHyena confining Hyena to early layers and preserving self-attention after sequence compression, balancing quality and efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- Adapt the original causal Hyena into a non-causal version more suitable for speech encoder processing
- Present ConfHyena and Hybrid ConfHyena models replacing part or all of Conformer self-attentions 
- Experiments on English ASR and 8 translation directions show Hybrid ConfHyena reduces training time by 27% with minimal (âˆ¼1%) quality degradation
- Conclude that Hybrid ConfHyena offers the most favorable balance between quality and efficiency

The key insight is using Hyena's lower complexity only on long sequences, switching back to efficient attention after intermediate sequence compression. This realizes substantial efficiency gains with marginal impact on model quality.
