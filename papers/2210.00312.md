# [Multimodal Analogical Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00312)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop artificial neural network models that are capable of multimodal analogical reasoning, and how does providing multimodal input compare to single-modal input for analogical reasoning?The key points are:- The paper introduces a new task of multimodal analogical reasoning, requiring models to make analogies across vision and language modalities. - Prior work has focused mainly on single-modal analogical reasoning, either in vision or language separately. This paper argues that multimodal reasoning is more akin to human cognition.- The paper constructs a new dataset and knowledge graph to study multimodal analogical reasoning.- Experiments compare various neural baselines on the new dataset. The proposed model called MarT outperforms others, showing the benefit of incorporating multimodal knowledge and an analogical reasoning framework.- Overall, the central hypothesis seems to be that neural models with multimodal knowledge inputs and some inductive biases for analogical reasoning will perform better at multimodal analogical reasoning compared to single-modal models without such specialized mechanisms. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the new dataset and models.In summary, the key research question is how to develop artificial neural network models for the new task of multimodal analogical reasoning, with a central hypothesis that multimodal models will outperform single-modal ones. The paper introduces data and models to test this hypothesis.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper introduces a new task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs, constructs a dataset and knowledge graph to support it, evaluates various baselines, and proposes a novel framework to improve performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my understanding of the paper, here are a few thoughts on how it compares to other related research:- The paper introduces a new task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs. This expands analogical reasoning beyond just a single modality (text or images) to incorporate multiple modalities with background knowledge graphs. Other research has focused more narrowly on analogical reasoning within a single modality.  - The paper constructs a new dataset MARS and knowledge graph MarKG to support research on this multimodal analogical reasoning task. Many other analogy datasets are limited to a single modality, so this contributes new multimodal resources to the field.- The paper evaluates various multimodal knowledge graph embedding methods and Transformer models on the task. Other papers on analogical reasoning usually focus evaluation on just one type of model, so this provides a more comprehensive benchmark of different modeling approaches.- The proposed MarT framework incorporates techniques like adaptive interaction and relation-oriented structure mapping that are tailored for analogical reasoning. Other models evaluate more generic architectures without explicit analogy components.- The analysis looks at model performance on different sub-tasks and ability to generalize to novel relations. Many papers focus just on overall accuracy, while this provides more fine-grained investigation of model capabilities.- Limitations are the focus just on reasoning over entities in the knowledge graph, rather than novel compositions. And lack of evaluation of very large pretrained models.Overall, the paper makes several notable contributions to advancing multimodal analogical reasoning compared to prior work, through the task formulation, new datasets, comprehensive benchmarking, and a specialized modeling framework. But there are still some limitations and open challenges for future work to address.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring multimodal analogical reasoning in more complex settings and domains beyond the current datasets. The authors propose trying more challenging analogy tasks that require deeper reasoning.- Investigating methods to enable models to make analogies to novel unseen entities and relations, not just ones present in the training data. This could help with few-shot or zero-shot learning by analogy.- Scaling up to larger multimodal knowledge graphs and pretrained models to further explore emergent reasoning abilities. The current models are still limited by dataset and model size.- Applying multimodal analogical reasoning to various downstream tasks like knowledge graph completion, question answering, etc. This could demonstrate the practical benefits. - Studying how different modalities interact and contribute to analogical reasoning. The authors suggest analyzing mechanisms for fusing vision and language information.- Developing more complex compositional and hierarchical reasoning abilities, which humans excel at but current models struggle with.- Exploring neuro-symbolic approaches that incorporate explicit relational structure along with neural representations and learning.In summary, the key suggestions are developing more challenging benchmarks, testing for generalization, scaling up models and data, applying analogical reasoning to downstream tasks, analyzing multimodal fusion, improving compositional reasoning, and integrating neuro-symbolic ideas. Advancing in these areas could lead to more capable and robust analogical reasoning.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces the task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs. Analogical reasoning is an important aspect of human cognition, but previous studies have focused mainly on single modal analogies (text or vision). This paper argues that multimodal analogical reasoning is more powerful, as information from multiple modalities provides stronger cognitive transfer. To enable research in this area, the authors construct two new datasets: 1) The Multimodal Analogical Reasoning dataset (MARS), containing textual and visual analogy examples paired with knowledge graph entities; and 2) The Multimodal Analogical Reasoning Knowledge Graph (MarKG), a multimodal knowledge graph containing entities, relations, images and descriptions. MarKG serves as background knowledge to support analogical reasoning in MARS. The authors evaluate strong baselines on MARS, including multimodal knowledge graph embeddings and pretrained transformers. They propose a novel model called MarT which adds several techniques to enhance multimodal analogy ability: adaptive interaction across analogy examples/questions, and a relation-oriented structure mapping loss. Experiments show that analogical reasoning components consistently improve baseline models, especially on blended textual/visual analogies. This demonstrates the difficulty of multimodal analogy and potential of the authors' framework. The paper makes a novel contribution in advancing analogical reasoning to multimodal scenarios with background knowledge. The datasets and analysis provide a foundation for future research on this challenging task.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel multimodal analogical reasoning framework called MarT that is designed to perform analogical reasoning over multimodal knowledge graphs. The key idea is to leverage the power of pre-trained Transformers for this task. The method has two main stages - first, the Transformer model is pre-trained on a multimodal knowledge graph called MarKG to obtain entity and relation embeddings. Second, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a multimodal analogical reasoning dataset called MARS using prompt-based tuning. During fine-tuning, an analogical reasoning prompt is constructed from the analogy example and question which guides the model to perform implicit relation mapping and entity prediction. Two key components are proposed as part of the MarT framework - (1) Adaptive Interaction to allow flexible interaction between the analogy example and question, and (2) Relation-Oriented Structure Mapping loss to focus the model on relation transfer rather than object similarity. Experiments show that MarT achieves new state-of-the-art results on the MARS dataset compared to previous knowledge graph embedding and Transformer baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is the lack of research into multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs. Some key points:- The paper notes that previous work on analogical reasoning has focused mainly on single modalities (either vision or language), but not both together. - It argues that incorporating multimodal information and background knowledge could improve analogical reasoning, based on theories from cognitive psychology like Mayer's Cognitive Theory.- Most prior datasets for analogical reasoning are limited to a single modality and do not incorporate structured knowledge graphs.- The paper introduces a new task formulation called "multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs" that combines reasoning over vision, text, and graph structured knowledge.- To support this task, the authors construct a new dataset called MARS and knowledge graph called MarKG with aligned entities and relations across vision, text, and knowledge graphs.- They evaluate various baselines on this dataset and propose a new model called MarT that incorporates ideas like adaptive interaction and structure mapping to achieve state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the key problem is the lack of multimodal analogical reasoning research and resources, which the paper aims to address through the introduction of a new dataset, knowledge graph, task formulation, and model approach. The goal is to move towards more human-like analogical reasoning over multimodal knowledge.
