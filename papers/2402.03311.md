# [HASSOD: Hierarchical Adaptive Self-Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Self-supervised object detection is an important capability but prior work suffers from limited object coverage. For example, CutLER can only detect a subset of objects in an image.  
- Traditional evaluation metrics like COCO AP are inadequate for assessing class-agnostic object detectors, as they penalize correct detections not in the pre-defined classes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes HASSOD, a hierarchical adaptive self-supervised object detection approach to improve object coverage.
- It first generates pseudo-labels for all possible objects in an image through a hierarchical merging process guided by a Vision Transformer. This provides comprehensive object coverage.  
- These pseudo-labels are used to train a Mask R-CNN detector in a self-supervised manner using Mean Teacher. The model learns to detect objects at multiple scales and granularity.
- The method is evaluated using Average Recall on datasets with more extensive annotations like LVIS and SA-1B.

Main Contributions:
- HASSOD significantly improves object coverage over prior self-supervised detectors, discovering up to 2x more objects.
- It demonstrates masking performance surpassing supervised methods like DETR and competitive with Mask R-CNN. 
- The approach is simple and efficient. The initial hierarchical clustering is parallelizable and detector training requires fewer iterations.
- The paper advocates the use of Average Recall and datasets with more annotations for reliably assessing self-supervised object detectors.

In summary, the paper presents HASSOD to address limited object coverage in self-supervised detection through hierarchical pseudo-labeling and demonstrates strong performance under a more appropriate evaluation protocol.
