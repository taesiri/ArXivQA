# [Do Pre-Trained Language Models Detect and Understand Semantic   Underspecification? Ask the DUST!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic underspecification is a common phenomenon where a sentence does not fully specify the intended meaning and requires additional context or knowledge for interpretation. For example, "Don't spend too much". How well can language models handle such underspecified sentences?

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced the DUST dataset containing over 4000 underspecified sentences categorized into types based on what causes the underspecification. 
- Tested several language models on two tasks: 1) detecting if a sentence is underspecified when explicitly prompted, and 2) interpreting underspecified sentences without explicit prompts.

Key Findings:
- Newer models like Llama 2 and Mistral moderately succeed at identifying underspecification when explicitly prompted, but all models struggle with interpreting the meaning of underspecified sentences.
- Providing more explicit prompting and instructions helps models perform better, but their accuracy is still limited.
- Models fail to show clear preference between interpretations for underspecified sentences as humans would.

Main Contributions:  
- First comprehensive study focused specifically on language models' capabilities in dealing with semantic underspecification using a dedicated evaluation set.
- Demonstrated the limitations of current language models for semantic underspecification, highlighting it as an important challenge for future research.  
- Showcased the effect of prompts and evaluation setup on measured model capabilities.

The paper systematically analyzed an important but less studied linguistic phenomenon using novel datasets and evaluation methods. The results reveal deficiencies in current language models' semantic processing abilities. The authors advocate for inclusion of semantic underspecification in evaluations of language models.
