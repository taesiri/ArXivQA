# [Tensor Network-Constrained Kernel Machines as Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Tensor networks (TNs) have recently been used to reduce the computational complexity of kernel machines by constraining the model weights. This yields storage and evaluation savings.
- However, it is not clear how TN-constrained kernel machines relate to Gaussian processes (GPs), a popular Bayesian modeling framework. Establishing this connection could provide insights into the behavior of TN models.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proves that Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and Tensor Train (TT)-constrained kernel machines recover a GP in the limit when placing i.i.d. priors over their parameters.
- The recovered GP is fully characterized in terms of the kernel and basis functions.
- Convergence rates are analyzed, showing TT exhibits faster convergence vs CPD for the same number of parameters.

Key Contributions:
- First result showing TN-constrained kernel machines recover a GP. Provides a way to interpret these models from a GP perspective.
- Characterization of the equivalent GP allows studying properties like convergence rates.   
- Analysis shows TT converges faster than CPD, so will exhibit more GP behavior for the same model size.
- Initialization strategy and regularization based onpriors that recover the full GP are provided.
- Experiments demonstrate convergence to GP and GP behavior at prediction.

In summary, the key insight is that TN-constrained kernel machines can be interpreted as specific kinds of GPs. This perspective allows better understanding properties like convergence rates and when GP behavior will emerge. The results also suggest techniques to improve training of these models.
