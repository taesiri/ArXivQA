# [FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference   Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Crafting high-quality prompts is critical for utilizing the full potential of large language models (LLMs) in end-user applications. However, prompt engineering is a complex task for average users.
- Existing automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have drawbacks like instability, model-centricity leading to degradation on out-of-box models, and lack of focus on optimizing instruction-oriented sections. 

Proposed Solution - Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO):
- Modular schema to flexibly take raw instruction, optional raw response, and optional ground truth to produce optimized prompts.
- Collected large-scale, high-quality prompt preference dataset using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- Explored supervised fine-tuning and preference learning strategies like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) to train the FIPO optimizer.
- Proposed Iterative Preference Learning pipeline for self-rewarding optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Introduced the concept and modular schema for free-form instruction-oriented prompt optimization.
- Compiled a large prompt preference dataset and explored strategies to fine-tune the FIPO optimizer. 
- Validated the efficacy of fine-tuned FIPO optimizer across 5 public benchmarks with varying downstream generators, obtaining significant improvements over previous LLM-powered APO methods.

In summary, the paper focuses on optimizing the instruction component in prompts through a modular end-to-end optimization framework and demonstrates effectiveness across diverse tasks.
