# [Self-similarity Driven Scale-invariant Learning for Weakly Supervised   Person Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12986)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to improve weakly supervised person search by addressing the scale variation problem. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called Self-similarity driven Scale-invariant Learning (SSL) to learn scale-invariant features for weakly supervised person search. The key hypotheses are:- The self-similarity prior can be utilized to learn scale-invariant features, i.e. a person looks similar at different scales. - Hard exemplar mining using multi-scale images of the same person can guide the network to learn scale-invariant features.- A dynamic multi-label learning method can generate more reliable pseudo-labels compared to clustering methods in weakly supervised settings.So in summary, the central research question is how to learn scale-invariant and discriminative features for weakly supervised person search, where only bounding box annotations are available. The main hypotheses are using self-similarity, hard exemplar mining, and dynamic multi-label learning to achieve this goal.
