# [Self-similarity Driven Scale-invariant Learning for Weakly Supervised   Person Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12986)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to improve weakly supervised person search by addressing the scale variation problem. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called Self-similarity driven Scale-invariant Learning (SSL) to learn scale-invariant features for weakly supervised person search. The key hypotheses are:

- The self-similarity prior can be utilized to learn scale-invariant features, i.e. a person looks similar at different scales. 

- Hard exemplar mining using multi-scale images of the same person can guide the network to learn scale-invariant features.

- A dynamic multi-label learning method can generate more reliable pseudo-labels compared to clustering methods in weakly supervised settings.

So in summary, the central research question is how to learn scale-invariant and discriminative features for weakly supervised person search, where only bounding box annotations are available. The main hypotheses are using self-similarity, hard exemplar mining, and dynamic multi-label learning to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel end-to-end self-similarity driven scale-invariant learning (SSL) framework for weakly supervised person search. 

2. It introduces a multi-scale exemplar branch to guide the network to learn body-aware and scale-invariant features by hard exemplar mining, addressing the scale variation issue in person search.

3. It designs a dynamic multi-label learning strategy to generate reliable pseudo labels for unsupervised learning. This is adaptable to different types of unlabeled data.

4. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks PRW and CUHK-SYSU for weakly supervised person search, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel weakly supervised person search framework that can learn discriminative and scale-invariant features guided by self-similarity priors. The multi-scale exemplar branch and dynamic pseudo label generation strategy effectively address the challenges in weakly supervised settings like scale variations and lack of identity labels. The strong experimental results validate the advantages of the proposed method.
