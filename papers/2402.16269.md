# [From Large Language Models and Optimization to Decision Optimization   CoPilot: A Research Manifesto](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical optimization can provide huge benefits for important business and societal decisions, but most decision-makers currently lack the skills to apply it 
- Making optimization accessible to more decision-makers has long been a major goal

Proposed Solution - Decision Optimization CoPilot (DOCP):
- Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT present an opportunity to achieve this goal
- The paper proposes research at the intersection of LLMs and optimization to create a DOCP - an AI assistant that interacts in natural language with decision-makers to formulate and solve optimization models
- This would guide the user to translate their business problem into an optimization model, solve it, and provide actionable recommendations 

Core Capabilities Required:
1. Translate business problem to optimization model
2. Enable user to verify model correctness 
3. Create efficient optimization models that can be solved in reasonable time

State of the Art:
- Survey and experiments with ChatGPT show LLMs have relevant capabilities but also major gaps to be addressed
- Good progress in using LLMs to generate models from precise problem descriptions 
- Little work on generating from high-level business problems or creating efficient models
- Experiments showed gaps in all 3 core capabilities

Research Directions:
- Best ways to adapt LLMs using prompting, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning
- Integrate LLMs into workflows like Tree/Graph of Thoughts
- Tools to enable business users to validate solutions 
- Use LLM capabilities for model queries and conversations
- Select optimization techniques and parameters 

Summary and Call to Action:
- DOCP vision could enable much wider use of optimization and improved decision-making
- Calls for LLM and optimization communities to come together to realize this vision
