# [Multi-level Optimal Control with Neural Surrogate Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of optimal actuator/sensor design for distributed parameter systems governed by PDEs. 
- Designing optimal actuators/sensors is critical before control system design, as it determines the capabilities of the control system.
- Evaluating a candidate actuator design requires solving computationally intensive optimal control problems, making optimization very expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a bi-level optimization problem with actuator design parameters at the upper level and associated optimal control problem at the lower level.
- Build neural network surrogates to replace the optimal control lower level problem. This allows fast evaluation of the objective and gradients. 
- Consider both unstructured surrogates, and structured surrogates that encode properties like non-negativity and convexity.
- Use the surrogates to optimize the actuator design parameters using both gradient-based and gradient-free methods.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation using neural network surrogates to alleviate computational burden in bi-level optimization problems for actuator/sensor design.
- Demonstration of both unstructured and structured surrogates that encode relevant mathematical properties.
- Application of both gradient-based and gradient-free optimization methods leveraging the learned surrogate models.
- Numerical demonstration of the approach on a linear-quadratic optimal control problem for optimizing actuator locations in a thermal system.

In summary, the key innovation is using structured neural network surrogates to replace optimal control lower level problems to enable efficient bi-level optimization for actuator/sensor design in distributed parameter systems. Both gradient-based and gradient-free methods are demonstrated to optimize the design leveraging the learned surrogate.
