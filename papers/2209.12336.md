# [Generating Formal Safety Assurances for High-Dimensional Reachability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generating Formal Safety Assurances for High-Dimensional Reachability":

Problem:
- Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for verifying safety and providing performance guarantees for autonomous systems with general nonlinear dynamics. 
- However, solving the HJ partial differential equation (PDE) has computational complexity that scales exponentially with state dimensionality, making it intractable for high-dimensional systems.
- The recently proposed DeepReach method uses a neural network to approximate the solution for high-dimensional reachability problems. But neural networks can make errors, so the computed reachable set may not be safe. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a method to compute an error bound on the DeepReach solution and correct it to obtain a provably safe approximation of the true reachable set.
- Key idea is to leverage consistency between learned value function and induced policy - if a state is deemed safe by the value function, the policy should keep the system safe.
- Formulate the computation of a correction bound as an optimization problem.
- Propose a scenario optimization approach to compute a probabilistic bound on this correction.

Contributions:
- Error correction mechanism for DeepReach that results in a provably safe reachable set and safety controller.
- Practical method to compute probabilistic bound on this error correction that works for general nonlinear systems.
- Demonstrate the approach on high-dimensional rocket landing and multi-vehicle collision avoidance problems to obtain probabilistically safe reachable sets.

Key outcomes:
- Ability to provide formal safety guarantees for neural network based reachability analysis. 
- Scenario optimization avoids restricting the approach to any specific class of systems or function approximators.
- Shows promise of using learning-based tools for safety-critical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to provide probabilistic safety guarantees for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems by computing an error bound on approximate reachable sets obtained from learning-based approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach to compute an error bound and correct the approximate reachable tube obtained from DeepReach, a deep learning based high-dimensional reachability analysis method. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) An error correction mechanism for DeepReach solutions that results in a provably safe approximate reachable tube and safety controller for general dynamical systems.

2) A practical method based on scenario optimization to compute a probabilistic bound on this error correction. This allows providing probabilistic safety guarantees without being restricted to a specific class of systems. 

3) Demonstration of the proposed verification approach to obtain probabilistically safe reachable tubes for high-dimensional rocket landing and multi-vehicle collision avoidance problems.

In summary, the paper presents a way to leverage deep learning based reachability analysis methods to provide formal safety assurances for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an error correction mechanism for the DeepReach solution to compute a provably safe approximate reachable tube. What are the key insights that enable computing this error bound? How is the consistency between the learned value function and the induced policy leveraged?

2. The paper formulates the computation of the error correction bound as an optimization problem. What makes this optimization problem challenging to solve in general? What assumptions need to be made about the learned value function for this optimization problem to be tractable?

3. The paper utilizes scenario optimization to compute a high-confidence bound on the error correction. Explain the key idea behind scenario optimization and how it is applied in the context of this paper. What guarantee does scenario optimization provide about the recovered safe set? 

4. How does the choice of the violation parameter ε and confidence parameter β in Scenario Optimization impact the size of the recovered safe set and the safety guarantees provided? What is the trade-off involved in selecting these parameters?

5. The recovered safe set provides a probabilistic safety guarantee. What does this probabilistic guarantee mean and how useful is it in practice for safety-critical applications? Can you suggest methods to provide deterministic guarantees instead?

6. The paper demonstrates the proposed approach on a variety of systems, including a high-dimensional rocket landing problem. Compare and contrast the performance of the method and quality of solutions obtained for the different case studies. What insights do you gain?

8. How suitable is the proposed verification approach for online application during deployment? What approximations or relaxations would be necessitated for real-time performance?

9. The error correction metric δ is used to evaluate and compare different learned value function approximations. Discuss the practical benefits and limitations of using δ as an evaluation metric.
