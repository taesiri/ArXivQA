# [Prometheus-Vision: Vision-Language Model as a Judge for Fine-Grained   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Assessing the quality of long-form text generated by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is challenging. Traditional metrics based on n-gram overlap with reference texts fail to capture nuances and don't provide meaningful feedback.
- Human evaluation is expensive and inconsistent. There is a need for automatic and flexible methods to evaluate VLM outputs based on customizable criteria.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the concept of "VLM-as-a-Judge", adapting the "LM-as-a-Judge" paradigm to the multi-modal domain.  
- Construct a new multi-modal feedback dataset called "Perception Collection" with 15K examples mapping customized evaluation criteria to reference outputs.
- Develop "Prometheus-Vision", an open-source 13B parameter VLM evaluator fine-tuned on "Perception Collection".

Key Contributions:
- First multi-modal feedback dataset with granular score rubrics to train a VLM evaluator.
- "Prometheus-Vision" - the first open-source VLM specialized for nuanced evaluation purposes. Correlates higher with human judgment and proprietary GPT-4V than existing models.
- Enables customizable, transparent and affordable evaluation of VLM outputs. Users can define own criteria instead of relying solely on coarse metrics like relevance or accuracy.
- Analysis shows "Prometheus-Vision" does not have length bias or strong self-enhancement bias.
- New test set "Perception Bench" can benchmark progress, especially on complex instructions grounded in real-world images.

In summary, this paper enables training of customized VLM evaluators via a new dataset, presents an effective open-source model, and provides frameworks to analyze model biases during evaluation. It is an important step towards affordable and trustworthy assessment of multi-modal AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes Prometheus-Vision, an open-source vision-language model trained to evaluate other VLMs by adhering to customized, fine-grained criteria, showing high correlation with human scores and proprietary models like GPT-4V.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the \textsc{Perception Collection}, the first multi-modal feedback dataset that can be used to train an evaluator vision-language model (VLM). In contrast to existing multi-modal feedback/critique/preference datasets that use coarse-grained criteria, the \textsc{Perception Collection} includes 15K fine-grained criteria that determine the crucial aspect to evaluate for each instance.

2. Introducing \textsc{Prometheus-Vision}, the first open-source VLM specialized for evaluation purposes. \textsc{Prometheus-Vision} shows high correlation with both GPT-4V and human evaluators, indicating its potential to serve as an inexpensive yet effective alternative to closed-source GPT-4V evaluation.

So in summary, the key contributions are a new multi-modal feedback dataset for training evaluator VLMs, and an open-source evaluator VLM called \textsc{Prometheus-Vision} that correlates well with human judgement and proprietary models like GPT-4V.
