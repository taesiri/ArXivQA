# [Bayes3D: fast learning and inference in structured generative models of   3D objects and scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08715)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Bayes3D, a novel 3D scene perception system for structured generative models of objects and scenes. Bayes3D can rapidly learn 3D models of novel objects from just a few views and then recognize and localize those objects robustly despite clutter and occlusion. It is based on GPU-accelerated sequential Monte Carlo inference in a probabilistic program that generates 3D objects and scenes. During inference, objects are detected and incorporated into a 3D scene graph model that supports massively parallel, low-resolution rendering and hierarchical Bayesian scoring against real depth images. Object poses are inferred via coarse-to-fine enumeration on the GPU, enabling efficient scoring of a large number of high-resolution poses. Experiments demonstrate that Bayes3D can learn complex 3D object models and accurately infer scene composition when used on a Panda robot in tabletop scenarios. Quantitative benchmarks also show orders-of-magnitude improvements in data efficiency over convolutional neural network baselines for pose and object type inference. The innovations in model robustness and inference performance enable Bayes3D to achieve real-time probabilistic perception and uncertainty-aware inferences on challenging real-world robotics problems.
