# [Hardware Acceleration of Neural Graphics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Does neural graphics need dedicated hardware acceleration support in order to achieve real-time high-resolution rendering performance?

The key hypothesis appears to be that current GPUs have significant performance and power limitations for rendering neural graphics in real-time at high resolutions needed for VR/AR, and that specialized hardware acceleration architectures can help bridge this gap. 

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1) There is a large (orders of magnitude) gap between target performance/power and what current GPUs can provide for neural graphics rendering. 

2) The main bottlenecks are the input encoding and MLP inference kernels common across neural graphics applications.

3) A scalable hardware architecture with dedicated engines for these kernels can significantly accelerate them and achieve much better overall application performance and power efficiency.

4) Their proposed NGPC architecture with fused input encoding and MLP engines can enable real-time rendering of high resolution (4K-8K) frames for representative neural graphics applications.

The experiments and results are aimed at quantifying the performance gaps, validating the bottlenecks, and demonstrating the benefits of their specialized hardware acceleration approach.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: does neural graphics (graphics based on neural representations) need hardware support in order to achieve real-time high resolution rendering? 

The key points related to this question are:

- Neural graphics uses neural representations to approximate traditional computer graphics algorithms. This promises a fast, deterministic replacement for complex rendering pipelines. 

- The authors study four representative neural graphics applications (NeRF, NSDF, NVR, GIA) and find a large gap between desired performance/power targets and what current GPUs can achieve. For example, there is a 25-90x gap in achieving 60 FPS 4K rendering. 

- Through profiling, the authors identify the input encoding (IE) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) kernels as key bottlenecks, consuming 40-60% of application time. 

- They propose a Neural Fields Processor (NFP) architecture with dedicated IE and MLP engines to accelerate these kernels in hardware. Multiple NFPs can be combined into a Neural Graphics Processing Cluster (NGPC).

- Evaluations show the NGPC can provide 8-64x speedups for the applications, enabling real-time 4K/8K rendering. The overhead is small, increasing GPU area by 4-36% and power by 3-22%.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that dedicated hardware support is needed to achieve real-time high resolution rendering with neural graphics. The authors make a case for this through profiling, architecting an accelerator, and demonstrating significant performance improvements.

The paper proposes a hardware architecture called the Neural Fields Processor (NFP) to accelerate neural graphics applications. The key insight is that input encoding (IE) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are performance bottlenecks, taking up a large fraction of execution time in typical neural graphics pipelines. To accelerate these, the NFP fuses together dedicated IE and MLP engines in hardware. The IE engine is optimized to efficiently perform grid lookups and directly streams outputs to the MLP engine's input memory, avoiding unnecessary memory traffic. The MLP engine is designed to fit the small MLPs common in neural graphics within its limited on-chip memory. Multiple NFPs can be grouped together into a Neural Graphics Processing Cluster (NGPC) attached to a GPU, cooperating to accelerate the IE and MLP portions of neural graphics applications.
