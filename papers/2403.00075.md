# [The Invariant Rauch-Tung-Striebel Smoother](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper considers the problem of state estimation for systems with states that are elements of a matrix Lie group, such as robot pose (position and orientation) estimation. Standard estimation methods like the extended Kalman filter (EKF) rely on linearization using Jacobians that can be inaccurate if the linearization point (i.e. state estimate) is poor. This reduces the robustness and convergence of these estimators.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an invariant Rauch-Tung-Striebel (IRTS) smoother which leverages an invariant filtering framework to achieve state-independent Jacobians under certain conditions. This is done by using a group-affine process model and left/right invariant measurement models with corresponding left/right invariant state errors. The resulting IRTS smoother has an forward pass equivalent to the invariant EKF, followed by a backward smoothing pass. This enhances performance compared to standard smoothers when initial state errors are large.

Contributions:
- Derivation of the IRTS smoothing equations for systems with matrix Lie group state elements
- Demonstration on an attitude and position estimation problem that the IRTS smoother outperforms standard RTS smoothing, especially for large initial errors
- Comparison to invariant and standard Gauss-Newton batch estimation methods, showing IRTS smoothing provides lower errors with fewer iterations
- Experimental validation using position and landmark measurements from the Starry Night dataset, showing clear benefits of the IRTS smoother over other methods

Overall, the paper develops a novel IRTS smoother methodology and provides a detailed experimental analysis highlighting its advantages for state estimation problems involving matrix Lie groups. The state-independent Jacobians improve robustness to poor initialization and linearization points.
