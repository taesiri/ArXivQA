# [Outlier detection using flexible categorisation and interrogative   agendas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Outlier/anomaly detection is important for many applications like fraud detection, network security, healthcare etc. 
- Most existing algorithms lack interpretability and explainability. This is especially important in domains like regulatory, legal where explanations of model outcomes are required.
- Effectiveness of categorization/outlier detection depends on the choice of features (interrogative agenda) used. Identifying an optimal agenda automatically is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) framework which provides formal representations and conceptual explanations. 
- Propose an unsupervised, interpretable FCA-based outlier detection algorithm. Outlier degree is based on size of concepts generated by an object.
- Develop a meta-learning algorithm to learn suitable fuzzy interrogative agendas by assigning weights to different feature sets.
- Combine meta-learning with unsupervised algorithm to get a supervised outlier detection method.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel white-box unsupervised and supervised FCA-based outlier detection algorithms using idea of interrogative agendas
- Show algorithms are interpretable and provide local and global explanations
- Evaluate algorithms on benchmark datasets and show performance matching or exceeding commonly used methods
- Explainability allows tracing which features and steps in algorithm determine outcomes 

Key Highlights:
- Use of multiple FCA lattices based on different feature sets (agendas) instead of just one
- Only computing size of concepts generated by objects improves efficiency and scalability 
- Learning agenda weights in supervised method captures relative importance of feature sets
- Explanations in terms of closure sizes, agenda weights and their effect on outlier degree
