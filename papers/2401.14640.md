# [Benchmarking Large Language Models in Complex Question Answering   Attribution using Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative language models can produce unreliable or "hallucinated" content when answering questions. Providing supporting evidence (attributions) with answers can improve reliability.  
- However, evaluating the quality of attributions in question answering systems remains an open challenge. Existing methods rely predominantly on costly manual evaluation or have limited capabilities in detecting subtle attribution errors.

Methodology:
- The paper introduces a more fine-grained set of attribution categories beyond simply "supported" vs "unsupported": supportive, insufficient, contradictory, and irrelevant.
- It develops an automated approach to generate benchmark QA datasets with different attribution categories and reasoning complexity levels, by leveraging knowledge graphs and extending their logical queries. 
- The benchmark called CAQA has over 160k QA examples with attributions automatically generated from two existing KGQA datasets.

Experiments and Results:  
- The paper tests 14 automatic attribution evaluators on CAQA, including general LLMs like GPT and specialized models. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, but models still struggle with the "insufficient" category.
- Analysis on attribution complexity and comparison with human annotations shows strong consistency, demonstrating the quality of the automaticaly generated benchmark.
- Evaluators trained on CAQA outperform prior specialized models on manually annotated data, proving its effectiveness.

Contributions:
- More fine-grained attribution categories and benchmark construction methodology using KGs
- Large-scale CAQA benchmark for analyzing and developing attribution evaluators  
- Extensive experiments highlighting challenges for models and the promise of benchmark training

The paper addresses an important open problem in improving reliability of question answering systems by attribution evaluation, with solid benchmark construction and model testing methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a more fine-grained attribution categorization for evaluating question answering systems, constructs a large-scale benchmark using knowledge graphs to automatically generate attributions of different categories and complexity levels, analyzes various attribution evaluators, and shows that fine-tuned large language models can serve as effective evaluators on the benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It defines more fine-grained attribution categories for question answering, including supportive, insufficient, contradictory and irrelevant, which can better characterize different errors in attribution. 

2. It develops an automatic approach to generate benchmarks for attributed question answering using knowledge graphs. This approach generates a new benchmark called CAQA which has larger scale, more fine-grained attribution categories, and more levels of reasoning complexity compared to previous benchmarks.

3. It analyzes and compares various automatic QA attribution evaluators on the CAQA benchmark. The results show that some large language models like Vicuna perform the best as evaluators when fine-tuned on the benchmark. 

4. It compares the automatically generated attribution categories in CAQA with human annotations, showing high consistency. This validates the usefulness of the automatic benchmark generation approach.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a way to automatically generate QA attribution benchmarks using knowledge graphs, and leveraging the benchmark to analyze, compare and develop better automatic evaluators for QA attribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Attributed question answering - The paper focuses on question answering where both an answer and supporting citations/evidence are provided.

- Attribution evaluation - Evaluating whether citations adequately support a generated answer statement. This is a key focus of the paper.  

- Fine-grained attribution categories - The paper proposes more detailed categories for classifying attributions like supportive, insufficient, contradictory, irrelevant.

- Attribution complexity - The paper analyzes attribution performance at different levels of reasoning complexity.

- Knowledge graphs - Knowledge graphs are used to automatically construct benchmark datasets for training and evaluating attribution methods. 

- Logical queries - Queries over knowledge graphs, like single triples or triple patterns, that are used to extract factual citations.

- Large language models - The paper analyzes and compares different LLMs as automatic attribution evaluators.

- Automatic benchmark generation - A key contribution is an automated methodology to construct attribution QA benchmarks from knowledge graphs.

So in summary, key terms revolve around attributed QA, fine-grained evaluation, benchmark construction from KGs, and analyzing LLMs as attribution evaluators.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces more fine-grained attribution categories including supportive, insufficient, contradictory and irrelevant. What is the rationale behind introducing these new categories compared to previous work? How do they help better evaluate attribution systems?

2. The paper constructs an automatic benchmark for attributed QA using knowledge graphs. What are the main advantages of using knowledge graphs for this task compared to other approaches like manually created datasets? 

3. When extending the logical queries from the KGQA datasets, two operations - intersection and union - are utilized. Why were these two logical operations chosen? What kinds of complexity do they allow capturing in the resulting queries?  

4. When generating structured attributions of different categories from the KG subgraphs, three strategies - deletion, replacement, and retrieval - are employed. Explain each strategy and what attribution category it targets. How do the strategies complement each other?

5. The conversion of KG subgraphs to natural language citations is done using the GPT-3.5-turbo model. What are the challenges in phrasing structured KG information into coherent natural language text? How can the reliability of this conversion be further improved?  

6. For the attribution evaluators, both zero-shot and fine-tuning experiments are conducted. Analyze and compare the results between the two settings. What weaknesses exist even for the best performing models?

7. The paper also analyzes the impact of different attribution complexity levels on the evaluator performance. Which complexity type poses the biggest challenge for models? Discuss potential reasons behind this.  

8. When comparing automatic and human annotated categories, high correlation is observed. But is there still room for improvement in the automatic benchmark creation? What could be done to further enhance alignment with human judgement?

9. On the ALCE-manual dataset, the Vicuna model trained on CAQA outperforms existing specialized attribution evaluators like AutoIS and AttrScore. What advantages does the CAQA training provide?

10. The paper focuses on evaluating textual attribution given structured KG information. How could this approach be extended to other information sources like tables, images, videos etc.? What additional challenges might arise?
