# [Can Pre-trained Vision and Language Models Answer Visual   Information-Seeking Questions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11713)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

"Do pre-trained vision and language models understand how to answer visual information-seeking questions?" 

Specifically, the authors aim to analyze whether recent advances in pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g. PaLI, CLIP) enable them to answer questions that require looking up knowledge beyond what is present in the image itself. 

To study this question, the authors introduce a new visual question answering (VQA) benchmark called InfoSeek that focuses on visual information-seeking questions, where the answer is not obvious from the image and requires external knowledge.

Using this new benchmark, the authors evaluate various pre-trained vision-language models under different conditions - with and without access to a knowledge base. Their key findings are:

- Current state-of-the-art pre-trained models still struggle to answer visual info-seeking questions, but fine-tuning on the InfoSeek dataset improves performance.

- Pipeline models that first recognize the visual entity and then query a knowledge base significantly outperform end-to-end models, showing the value of external knowledge.

- However, end-to-end models show better generalization on rare/tail entities.

Overall, the central hypothesis is that existing pre-trained vision-language models have limited capability for visual information-seeking tasks, but this can be improved through fine-tuning on in-domain data or incorporating external knowledge. The InfoSeek benchmark provides a way to analyze these models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduces a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset called InfoSeek that focuses specifically on visual information-seeking questions. This helps fill a gap, as existing VQA datasets do not sufficiently cover this type of question.

2. Performs a multi-stage human annotation process to create a subset of InfoSeek (8.9K examples) with natural information-seeking questions. Also creates a large-scale subset (1.3M examples) by combining visual datasets with Wikidata. 

3. Proposes two evaluation protocols called "No KB" and "With KB" to analyze different types of models - end-to-end vision-language models vs pipeline models using an explicit knowledge base.

4. Experiments with state-of-the-art vision-language models like PaLI and OFA under the "No KB" setting. Finds they can answer some info-seeking questions after fine-tuning but struggle with generalizing to new entities or questions requiring deeper knowledge.

5. Shows that pipeline models utilizing an external knowledge base significantly outperform end-to-end models, especially on real-world questions. Highlights the impact of better visual entity recognition.  

6. Discovers end-to-end models uniquely outperform on rare entities, revealing promise for combining both model families.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a new benchmark and analysis methodology to understand visual information-seeking capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models. The analysis reveals current limitations and future directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on visual information-seeking questions and knowledge-based VQA:

- It introduces a new large-scale dataset, InfoSeek, specifically designed to benchmark visual info-seeking questions. Many prior VQA datasets focus more on visual attributes or common sense knowledge rather than information seeking.

- The paper proposes two evaluation protocols - with and without access to a knowledge base (KB). This allows for clear analysis of different model families and whether they acquire knowledge through pre-training or rely on external KB retrieval. 

- The analysis reveals challenges for current visual-language models on info-seeking questions, especially on generalizing to new entities. End-to-end models struggle with time/numerical questions requiring deeper knowledge compared to pipeline models.

- The paper highlights the unique strength of end-to-end models on tail entities, while pipeline models excel on popular head entities. This suggests promising directions for combining both approaches.

- Overall, the analysis and newly introduced benchmark address gaps in prior VQA research and provide insights into knowledge acquisition in pre-trained visual-language models. The findings pave the way for developing next-generation multi-modal pre-training.

In summary, this paper pushes forward research in knowledge-based VQA through its analysis, proposed protocols, and introduction of the InfoSeek dataset for assessing visual information-seeking capabilities. The findings reveal current limitations of pre-trained models and opportunities for progress.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Improving visual entity recognition. The authors find this is a bottleneck for pipeline models and better entity recognition could significantly improve performance on answering visual info-seeking questions. They suggest exploring different approaches like end-to-end models which have an advantage for rare entities.

- Incorporating more fine-grained knowledge into pre-training. The authors find end-to-end models lack deeper knowledge to answer certain question types like time and numerical questions. They suggest pre-training on more diverse data with fine-grained information could help improve these models.

- Combining end-to-end and pipeline models. The authors highlight the unique advantages of end-to-end models for rare entities and pipeline models for popular entities. They suggest exploring ways to combine these complementary strengths.

- Expanding the diversity of knowledge. The authors note their dataset currently focuses more on physical attributes and factual information. They suggest expanding to more social and abstract knowledge could reveal new challenges.

- Studying human dialogues and multi-turn QA. The current work looks at single turn QA but the authors suggest studying dialogues and conversations could lead to more natural QA systems.

In summary, key directions include improving visual entity recognition, incorporating more diverse fine-grained knowledge into pre-training, combining end-to-end and pipeline models, expanding knowledge types, and exploring multi-turn dialogues. The authors propose their analysis and dataset can serve as a starting point for exploring these areas further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents InfoSeek, a new visual question answering (VQA) benchmark dataset focused on asking information-seeking questions about images. The key motivation is to evaluate whether pre-trained vision-language models can answer visual information-seeking questions, which require more specialized knowledge beyond what is directly in the image. The authors create a multi-stage human-annotated dataset of 8.9k natural info-seeking visual QA pairs to simulate real user information needs. They also generate a large-scale dataset of 1.3M examples by combining existing visual entity datasets with Wikidata for model training and evaluation. The data is split to test generalization to unseen questions and entities. Experiments are conducted with state-of-the-art vision-language models like PaLI and CLIP, as well as large language models like PaLM, under "No KB" and "With KB" settings. Results show current models struggle with visual info-seeking questions but can be improved via fine-tuning and providing KB access. Analysis reveals challenges in acquiring fine-grained knowledge and generalizing to new entities, presenting opportunities for future multi-modal pre-training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new visual question answering dataset called InfoSeek that focuses on asking information-seeking questions about images. The key motivation is to evaluate whether pre-trained vision-language models can answer questions that require external knowledge not present in the image itself. To create the dataset, the authors use a multi-stage annotation process where different groups of annotators write and answer questions to simulate real information seeking. This results in a high-quality human-annotated subset with 8.9k examples. The authors also automatically generate a much larger subset from Wikidata, resulting in over 1 million image-question-answer triplets covering diverse entities. 

The paper proposes two evaluation protocols to analyze different families of models on the InfoSeek dataset. The "No KB" setting evaluates end-to-end vision-language models like PaLI and OFA that must store knowledge in their parameters. The "With KB" setting evaluates pipeline models that first recognize entities in the image and then extract knowledge from Wikipedia. Experiments show end-to-end models struggle with knowledge-intensive questions compared to pipeline models that retrieve knowledge, indicating substantial room for improvement. The analysis also reveals end-to-end models have an advantage for rare entities. Overall, the paper demonstrates the challenges of visual information seeking and provides insights to guide future multi-modal pre-training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new visual question answering dataset called InfoSeek that focuses on asking information-seeking questions about visual entities in images. To create a natural distribution of questions, a multi-stage human annotation process is used where different annotators write questions and provide answers, without seeing each other's work. This simulates a real-world scenario where the question asker does not already know the answer. In addition, the authors automatically generate a large-scale dataset from Wikidata knowledge triples and human-authored templates, resulting in over 1 million image-question-answer triplets. The models are evaluated with two protocols - No KB and With KB - to analyze their capability to store and retrieve knowledge. End-to-end vision-language models like PaLI are finetuned and compared against pipeline models that first recognize the visual entity using CLIP and then answer questions by reading retrieved Wikipedia passages with a fusion-in-decoder model. The analysis shows that while end-to-end models can answer some questions after finetuning, pipeline models with explicit knowledge retrieval substantially outperform them.

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper introduces a new visual question answering dataset called InfoSeek that focuses on information-seeking questions about images, and uses it to analyze different pre-trained vision-language models, finding that pipeline models utilizing external knowledge significantly outperform end-to-end models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question it aims to address is:

Do pre-trained vision and language models have the capability to answer visual information-seeking questions? 

In particular, the authors note that while large language models have shown an impressive ability to answer knowledge-intensive textual questions, it is not well understood if similar pre-trained visual-language models can effectively answer questions that require external knowledge about objects/entities depicted in an image. 

To study this question, the paper argues that an appropriate visual question answering (VQA) benchmark focused on info-seeking queries is needed. It discusses limitations of existing VQA datasets for evaluating visual information-seeking capabilities.

To address these limitations, the paper introduces a new large-scale VQA dataset called InfoSeek that contains natural information-seeking visual questions collected via multi-stage human annotation. 

Using this new benchmark, the paper evaluates various pre-trained vision-language models to gain insights into their ability to answer knowledge-intensive, visually-grounded questions. The analysis aims to determine characteristics of different model families and where the key challenges lie in developing robust visual info-seeking capabilities.

In summary, the key research question is whether existing pre-trained vision and language models can effectively answer visual information-seeking questions that require external knowledge beyond what is directly depicted in the image. The paper introduces a new benchmark to facilitate this analysis.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces InfoSeek, a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset tailored for evaluating how well multi-modal models can answer visual information-seeking questions. The key innovation is that InfoSeek questions require knowledge beyond just the image, focusing on long-tail entities and fine-grained facts. The authors argue previous VQA datasets like OK-VQA emphasize common sense knowledge, while InfoSeek forces models to retrieve and reason about knowledge. InfoSeek combines 8.9k human-annotated examples probing model curiosity with 1.3m automated QA pairs sourced from Wikidata, covering 11k entities and 2.7k types. Experiments using InfoSeek reveal current vision-language models like PaLI and BLIP struggle on info-seeking VQA. However, models can be improved by fine-tuning on InfoSeek, suggesting the data elicits knowledge acquired during pre-training. Further gains are achieved by incorporating entity linking and reading Wikipedia articles, indicating potential for future work on visual entity recognition. Overall, InfoSeek enables more rigorous analysis of knowledge and reasoning in VQA systems through natural information-seeking questions grounded in images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents InfoSeek, a new visual question answering benchmark for evaluating the ability of models to answer visual information-seeking questions which require knowledge beyond just the image.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces InfoSeek, a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset focused on challenging, knowledge-intensive information-seeking questions about images. The authors argue that existing VQA datasets like VQAv2 and OK-VQA rely too heavily on visual attributes or common sense knowledge, while InfoSeek requires retrieving specific facts from structured knowledge sources. InfoSeek combines a small set of natural freeform questions collected via a two-stage human annotation process, as well as a larger semi-automatically generated dataset using Wikipedia and Wikidata. Experiments demonstrate that even top existing multimodal models like PaLI-X and BLIP2 struggle on InfoSeek's information-seeking questions, especially on tail entities. However, giving the models access to relevant Wikipedia articles during training significantly improves performance. The authors conclude that incorporating more structured fine-grained knowledge, either through better pre-training or retrieval mechanisms, is key to improving visual question answering for information-seeking queries.
