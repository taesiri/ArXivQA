# [MoVQA: A Benchmark of Versatile Question-Answering for Long-Form Movie   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04817)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces MoVQA, a new long-form movie question-answering dataset and benchmark for assessing models on long-term video understanding. MoVQA contains 21,953 manually annotated QA pairs from 100 movies covering diverse genres. The questions are designed to assess capabilities on various perceptual and cognitive abilities from a moviegoer's perspective. 

A key feature of MoVQA is the multi-level temporal lengths of the video clips used, including single-scene (median length 7.5 minutes), multi-scene (20 minutes) and full-scene (120 minutes). This allows benchmarking models on increasing levels of difficulty. The median clue length is around 230 seconds, over 2x longer than prior datasets. 

The questions are categorized into six types - information synopsis, temporal perception, spatial perception, causal reasoning, hypothetical reasoning and use of external knowledge. This combination allows comprehensive assessment of both perceptual and cognitive skills for movie understanding.

The paper benchmarks several state-of-the-art videoQA and multimodal models on MoVQA and finds unsatisfactory performance, with ample scope for improvement. It also proposes a baseline model combining dynamic keyframe selection and contextual modeling which achieves new state-of-the-art results. Overall, MoVQA incentivizes developing models with human-level understanding of long videos.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(1) It introduces MoVQA, a new long-form movie question-answering dataset and benchmark containing 21,953 manually annotated QA pairs from 100 movies. The dataset has multi-level temporal lengths (single-scene, multi-scene, and full-scene) to assess model capabilities on video understanding across different lengths.

(2) The QA pairs are designed from the perspective of abilities required for movie understanding and cover diverse types like information synopsis, temporal perception, spatial perception, causal reasoning, hypothetical reasoning, and external knowledge. This makes the dataset more versatile compared to prior video QA datasets. 

(3) The paper benchmarks various state-of-the-art video QA and multimodal language models on MoVQA. The results show current methods still achieve unsatisfactory performance, indicating ample scope for improvement on this challenging dataset. 

(4) The authors propose a baseline method called Dual Perceiver Modeling (DPM) which combines keyframe selection and contextual modeling. DPM achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoVQA compared to other methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and benchmarking of a new versatile and long-form video QA dataset called MoVQA to drive progress in long-form video understanding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the advantages and limitations of keyframe selection to capture relevant clues for long-form video QA?  How might the approach be improved?

2. The dual perceiver framework models both keyframes and full context. Why is modeling both important for long-form video QA? What are the tradeoffs?  

3. What strategies could be used to better combine the clues from keyframes versus the full context modeling?  Should they be weighted differently? Fused in a more sophisticated manner?

4. The authors use 32 keyframes selected from 512 uniformly sampled frames. What would be the impact of using more or less keyframes? What principle guided the choice of 32?

5. The context branch uses 32 learnable query embeddings to model the context of 512 sampled frames/subtitles. Why use learnable queries instead of fixed queries? What determines the ideal number of queries? 

6. Both visual frames and subtitles are used as input modalities. In what ways do they provide complementary information? When would relying on just one modality fail?

7. For the keyframe selection, both visual and subtitle information are combined. Why not rely solely on subtitles given they directly reflect dialogues? In what cases could just subtitles fail?

8. The distractor options are manually created by human annotators. What are the challenges and potential biases when relying solely on language models like ChatGPT to generate distractors?  

9. The dataset contains videos of varying lengths. Is performance degradation graceful with increasing length or are there sharp drop-offs? Why might we expect drop-offs?

10. Could other contextual modeling approaches like sparse attention or memory networks capture longer context more effectively? What are their potential benefits and downsides?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video QA datasets have limited video and clue lengths, narrow question types, and rely mostly on visual information. They are not sufficient to assess models on long-term video understanding with complex narratives. 
- There is a need for a benchmark to evaluate the diverse cognitive capabilities of models on long-form videos using multimodal information.

Solution - The MoVQA Dataset:
- Introduces MoVQA, a long-form movie QA dataset with 21,953 QA pairs from 100 movies covering different genres.
- Has multi-level QA pairs from single-scene (8 mins), multi-scene (20 mins) and full-scene (120 mins) to assess understanding across different video lengths.
- Median clue length is about 200s, 320s and 540s for the 3 scenes respectively, which is much longer than prior datasets. 
- QA types are more diverse - information synopsis, temporal perception, spatial perception, causal reasoning, hypothetical reasoning, external knowledge - requiring versatile reasoning abilities.
- Answering questions needs integrating both visual information from videos and textual information from subtitles.

Proposed Method:
- Presents a Dual Perceiver Model (DPM) framework that handles long videos by selecting keyframes most relevant to the question and modeling overall contextual information.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a more challenging benchmark for assessing long-form video understanding using lengthy, multimodal movie QA pairs spanning diverse reasoning skills.
- Analysis of various methods shows current models still struggle on MoVQA, providing scope for advancement.
- Establishes strong baselines for the dataset using the proposed DPM framework.

The paper aims to drive progress in long-term, holistic video understanding and reasoning. The MoVQA dataset and analysis provide insights into current limitations as well as future research directions.
