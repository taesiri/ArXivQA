## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of access to quality healthcare globally, especially in remote/rural areas, resulting in high mortality rates.
- Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational requirements.  

Proposed Solution - MedAide:
- An on-premise healthcare chatbot leveraging tiny LLMs integrated with LangChain to provide efficient preliminary medical diagnostics and support from edge devices without needing server infrastructure.

Key Contributions:
- Employs optimized tiny LLMs like OPT-125M, Bloom-560M, and LLaMa-2 7B that are specifically selected based on performance, availability, and ability to deploy on edge devices.
- Additional optimizations done via techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce trainable parameters. 
- Models trained on curated medical datasets from diverse sources and further enhanced via reinforcement learning from human feedback.
- Integrates LangChain and FAISS to efficiently search medical databases to improve recommendations.
- Evaluated on consumer GPUs and Nvidia Jetson boards, MedAide achieves 77% accuracy in medical consultations and a USMLE benchmark score of 56.
- Enables an energy-efficient healthcare assistance platform deployable at the edge, alleviating privacy concerns.

In summary, MedAide is an edge-based medical chatbot that employs optimized tiny LLMs to provide accurate diagnostics and assistance without needing server infrastructure. It is customized for edge devices through careful model selection and training methods.
