# Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform image inpainting (filling in missing or corrupted regions of an image) robustly for irregular holes of arbitrary shape, size and location. The key hypothesis is that using a "partial convolution" layer and automatic mask updating procedure within a convolutional neural network framework can:1) Allow the model to be agnostic to placeholder values used to initialize the holes/missing regions. This avoids artifacts such as color discrepancy, blurriness, and artificial edge effects that result from conditioning on placeholder values.2) Enable the generation of semantically meaningful image content to fill holes without expensive post-processing or refinement networks typically needed to make initial CNN-based inpainting predictions blend well.3) Generalize successfully to irregular hole shapes, unlike prior work focused on rectangular regions.4) Utilize skip connections in encoder-decoder style networks like U-Net to produce higher-fidelity outputs, which has been problematic for prior CNN approaches to image inpainting.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using partial convolutions with automated mask updating can achieve robust image inpainting for arbitrarily shaped holes without dependence on initializations or post-processing.
