# [AutoML-GPT: Automatic Machine Learning with GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we build an effective Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) system using large language models (LLMs) like GPT that can automate machine learning pipelines for diverse AI tasks?The key hypothesis is that by leveraging the natural language processing capabilities and knowledge contained in LLMs like GPT, it is possible to create an AutoML system that can understand task instructions and dataset/model metadata provided by users, and automatically carry out full machine learning workflows including data processing, model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, training, and evaluation. The authors propose and develop an AutoML system called AutoML-GPT that aims to demonstrate this hypothesis. AutoML-GPT takes as input data cards, model cards, evaluation metrics and other user requests describing the task and data, and leverages GPT to automatically generate workflows for data processing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, training, and evaluation. The goal is to show that the language modeling capabilities of GPT can effectively automate complex end-to-end machine learning pipelines for diverse tasks spanning computer vision, NLP, etc. The experiments on various datasets aim to validate whether AutoML-GPT can deliver strong performance across different domains in a generalizable and effective way.In summary, the central research question is whether LLMs like GPT can be utilized to create an AutoML system that automates machine learning workflows, and the key hypothesis is that the natural language processing power of GPT can enable such an effective general-purpose AutoML system. The AutoML-GPT system and experiments are designed to validate this hypothesis.
