# [What About the Data? A Mapping Study on Data Engineering for AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05156)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As AI systems mature and get deployed, organizations struggle with the data infrastructure and pipelines required to build, train and serve these AI systems. There is a lack of guidance on how to do "data engineering for AI", i.e. setting up data architectures and pipelines across the AI engineering life cycle. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper performs a systematic mapping study to identify existing literature on data engineering for AI systems. It selects 25 relevant papers using a structured search and selection process, and analyzes these papers to answer the research question "How to do data engineering for AI systems?".

Main Contributions:

- Provides an overview of existing solutions for AI data engineering across different life cycle phases like data collection, model training, deployment and monitoring.

- Identifies technical solutions like data validation tools, synthetic data generation, and deployment platforms. 

- Summarizes proposed architectures for system-level and enterprise-wide AI data engineering.

- Lists lessons learned and best practices from case studies on setting up AI data pipelines.

- Discusses implications for practitioners (e.g. consider DataOps, data spaces, domain specifics) and researchers (e.g. integrate data/software/systems engineering, research DataOps).

- Creates a structured classification of existing literature to identify gaps and future work like production data engineering, data meshes/fabrics for AI, and open source tooling.

In summary, the paper systematically analyzes and structures the emerging research area of "data engineering for AI", highlighting solutions, architectures and best practices, as well as open issues and opportunities. This supports both practitioners in implementing AI data pipelines as well as researchers in advancing this field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a mapping study to create an overview of existing literature on data engineering for AI systems from an AI engineering perspective, finding that most papers focus on engineering training or production pipelines rather than overall data architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is providing an overview of the existing literature on data engineering for AI systems from an AI engineering perspective. Specifically, the paper:

- Performs a systematic mapping study to identify 25 relevant papers on data engineering for AI systems published between 2019-2023.

- Classifies these papers based on metadata, scope of data engineering activities, and type of solutions proposed. 

- Analyzes the papers to identify which AI and data engineering lifecycle phases are covered, what technical solutions and architectures are proposed, and what lessons learned are presented.

- Discusses implications of the findings for both AI engineering practitioners and researchers. 

In summary, the paper creates a structured overview of the current body of knowledge in this emerging research area of data engineering for AI systems. It highlights existing solutions as well as open challenges and opportunities for future work. The intended contribution is to provide guidance for both practitioners in implementing AI data engineering and for researchers in advancing research on this topic.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper follows specific guidelines from Kitchenham and Charters for the paper selection process. Can you explain in more detail the inclusion and exclusion criteria used and the rationale behind them? 

2. The paper uses a specific search query with terms like "data engineering" and "AI engineering". What is the justification behind the choice of search terms and databases selected? Could the search strategy be improved further?

3. The paper applies both automatic and manual screening of papers based on title/abstract and full text. What are some of the limitations of relying solely on manual screening? Could the paper selection process be more robust? 

4. The paper performs backward and forward citation snowballing to expand the list of relevant papers. What are some of the pros and cons of this technique? How can snowballing introduce biases?

5. The authors classify the selected papers along multiple dimensions like metadata, scope, solution type etc. What is the rationale behind each of these classification schemes? How do they help answer the research questions?

6. The paper codes the content of selected papers to answer the four research questions. Can you explain if there are any threats related to researcher bias in the coding process? If yes, how can they be mitigated?

7. When analyzing the lifecycle phases covered in the selected papers, the authors identify a gap in coverage of enterprise-level data architectures. What could be done to encourage research in this area?  

8. While discussing technical solutions, the paper points out that they cover different lifecycle phases. How can solutions covering the entire lifecycle be designed and validated? What are some of the key challenges?

9. When examining the proposed architectures, the authors recognize a lack of focus on enterprise-wide data architectures. What architectural principles can guide the design of such architectures? 

10. The lessons learned are said to be diverse and at multiple levels of scope. How can we categorize and structure these lessons learned to serve as usable and accessible best practices?
