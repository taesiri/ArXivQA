# [PanGu-$π$: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity   Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but scaling them up in terms of model size and data size leads to massive computational costs. 
- Methods for constructing better model architectures for LLMs are rarely explored. 
- Existing Transformer architectures used in LLMs have limited nonlinear expressivity, leading to a feature collapse problem where representations of different tokens become overly similar in deeper layers.

Proposed Solution:
- Enhance nonlinearity in Transformer architectures to mitigate feature collapse and improve model efficiency.
- Introduce a series informed activation function in the feedforward network to increase nonlinearity without extra computations.  
- Develop an augmented shortcut parallel to the self-attention to prevent feature collapse.
- Combine the above two techniques to construct the PanGu-π architecture.

Main Contributions:
- Carefully analyze the feature collapse problem in LLMs and relate it to the nonlinearity of Transformer architectures.
- Propose a series informed activation function and an augmented shortcut to enhance nonlinearity.
- Develop the PanGu-π architecture that integrates the two techniques.  
- Train PanGu-π models at 7B and 1B scales, which achieve better accuracy and efficiency compared to models of similar sizes.
- Apply PanGu-π in specialized domains by developing YunShan model, showing superior performance in legal and financial tasks over counterparts.

In summary, this paper identifies the lack of nonlinearity as a key limitation of Transformer architectures in LLMs. To address this, both the feedforward network and self-attention are refined to increase overall nonlinear expressivity. This allows the proposed PanGu-π architecture to achieve new state-of-the-art results using similar model sizes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new language model architecture called PanGu-π to enhance nonlinearity and alleviate feature collapse in Transformers. This is done by introducing a series informed activation function in the feedforward network and an augmented shortcut in the self-attention modules.

2. It builds two versions of the PanGu-π model with 7 billion and 1 billion parameters. Experiments show these models achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other open-source models of similar size on a variety of NLP tasks.

3. It develops a domain-specialized model called YunShan based on PanGu-π architecture and trained on finance and legal data. YunShan demonstrates exceptional performance on domain-specific benchmarks, outperforming existing models.

4. It provides extensive theoretical analysis and careful ablations to demonstrate the feature collapse problem in Transformers and validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques to enhance nonlinearity and diversity.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new Transformer architecture that enhances nonlinearity to improve model accuracy and efficiency for both general and domain-specific language tasks.
