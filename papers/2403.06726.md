# [Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition":

Problem:
- Long-tailed distribution of data, where there is an exponential decline in the number of samples per class from head to tail, is prevalent in real-world visual data. This causes an imbalance issue that impairs the performance of standard supervised learning algorithms.
- Recent work has shown that supervised contrastive learning (SCL) can alleviate data imbalance. However, SCL relies on large batches to construct sufficient contrastive pairs covering all classes, which is difficult for class-imbalanced data.  

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a novel probabilistic contrastive (ProCo) learning algorithm that estimates the feature distribution of each class and samples contrastive pairs from it. This eliminates the need for large batches in SCL.
- Make a reasonable assumption that the normalized features follow a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on the unit hypersphere. This allows efficiently estimating distribution parameters using only first sample moments across batches.
- Derive a closed-form expected SCL loss by sampling an infinite number of contrastive pairs from the estimated vMF distributions. This avoids explicitly sampling many pairs.

Main Contributions:
- Propose ProCo algorithm that estimates feature distributions to sample contrastive pairs, eliminating need for large batches in SCL.
- Employ vMF distribution assumption for normalized features that enables efficient parameter estimation and closed-form expected loss.
- Theoretically analyze error bounds of ProCo loss to assure robustness.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed visual recognition with significantly improved generalization, especially for tail classes.
- Extend ProCo to semi-supervised learning by generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data based on ProCo loss.
