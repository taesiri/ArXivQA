# [Sibyl: Forecasting Time-Evolving Query Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Database systems often rely on historical query traces to perform workload-based performance tuning and optimization. However, real-world workloads evolve over time, making historical queries less effective for optimizing future workloads. The paper identifies three key limitations of prior works on workload forecasting: (1) They only predict partial queries or coarse-grained workload features rather than full query statements. (2) They do not effectively capture the time-evolving nature of real workloads. (3) They have scalability issues in terms of training overhead and model storage.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes Sibyl, an end-to-end machine learning framework to accurately forecast future query workloads. The key ideas include:

(1) Template-based featurization to represent recurring queries in a workload by extracting a template structure and evolving parameter values. This simplifies modeling and reconstruction of queries. 

(2) Stacked LSTM encoder-decoder model called Sibyl-LSTMs to capture both temporal dependencies as well as inter-dependencies between query parameters.

(3) Template cutting and packing techniques to address large and small templates respectively, convert the problem into per-bin models, and improve scalability.  

(4) Feedback loop to incrementally adapt models to workload shifts without full retraining.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of next-k and next-time interval workload forecasting problems.

- Template-based featurization and Sibyl-LSTMs model for accurate forecasting.

- Template cutting and packing algorithms to achieve high scalability.  

- Feedback loop for automatic model adjustment under shifts.

- Demonstrating high accuracy for multiple real-world workloads and performance gains in view selection and index tuning.

The paper makes workload forecasting practical by providing complete query statements and showing gains in real database applications. The ideas can enable existing tools to handle evolving workloads.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Sibyl, a machine learning-based framework to forecast future database query workloads across different time horizons by capturing workload evolution patterns and relationships between queries to enable existing database optimization tools, without modification, to handle time-evolving workloads.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents Sibyl, an end-to-end machine learning-based framework for accurately forecasting future query workloads over various time intervals. The main contributions are:

1. It proposes formal problem definitions for next-$k$ and next-$\Delta t$ query workload forecasting. 

2. It develops template-based featurization techniques and a stacked LSTM encoder-decoder model called Sibyl-LSTMs to effectively capture both temporal dependencies and inter-dependencies between query parameters.

3. It handles large query volumes through template cutting and packing algorithms to improve scalability. 

4. It incorporates a feedback loop to detect workload shifts and adapt models incrementally.

5. It demonstrates high forecasting accuracy on four real-world workloads and shows performance improvements when applied to materialized view selection and index selection applications.

In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end forecasting framework that can predict entire future query statements with precise parameter values over various time intervals for time-evolving workloads. This enables direct application of existing database optimization tools that rely on query semantics without any modifications.
