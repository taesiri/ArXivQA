# [Extreme Two-View Geometry From Object Poses with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Estimating the relative camera pose between two images with extreme viewpoint changes is very challenging. Traditional methods relying on feature matching fail due to the lack of overlapping regions and correspondences. Although humans can easily perceive extreme viewpoint differences, existing computer vision techniques struggle with such tasks.

Method:
This paper proposes a new approach to estimate accurate relative camera poses given two images containing a common object captured from vastly different viewpoints. The key idea is to leverage object priors learned by diffusion models like Zero123 to hallucinate unseen sides of the object and match generated views to determine the poses. 

Specifically, the authors first transform the camera pose estimation problem into an object pose estimation problem for better integration with the diffusion model. To enable the use of Zero123 which assumes centered objects, they introduce virtual cameras looking at the object center and determine associated intrinsics. The input image's in-plane rotation and elevation are also estimated to correctly guide novel view generation. With intrinsic matrices and poses defined for all images, they can match against the generated set to solve for the query image's object pose and thereby relative camera pose.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate extreme two-view geometry estimation as an object pose estimation problem to take advantage of diffusion priors
- Propose techniques to orient input images, define virtual camera intrinsics/poses, and generate useful novel views  
- Achieve significantly higher accuracy than previous state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets
- Demonstrate the practical utility of the approach by integrating it with a visual odometry system to improve camera tracking

The method shows excellent performance and robustness to large viewpoint differences. It also generalizes well across diverse objects without category-specific priors. The integration with downstream applications highlights its usefulness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method to accurately estimate relative camera poses between two images with extreme viewpoint differences by utilizing object priors learned from a diffusion model to hallucinate unseen sides of the co-visible object and match the hallucinated images for pose estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel pose estimation algorithm for image pairs with extreme viewpoint changes, based on diffusion models and image matching. 

2. Mathematically transforming the relative pose estimation problem into an object pose estimation problem to enable the utilization of object priors in diffusion models.

3. Significantly improving the accuracy of extreme two-view pose estimation on both synthetic and real datasets, and showing promising results in combination with a visual odometry method.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a new approach to accurately estimate the relative camera pose between two views with extreme changes in viewpoint, by leveraging object priors learned by diffusion models. This allows tackling a very challenging setting that most previous methods fail at. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Extreme two-view geometry - The paper focuses on estimating relative camera poses between two views with extreme/large viewpoint differences, which presents challenges for traditional methods. 

- Object priors - The method utilizes priors about objects learned from large-scale diffusion models to help estimate poses despite lack of feature overlaps.

- Diffusion models - Specifically, the Zero123 diffusion model is fine-tuned and used to generate novel views of objects, providing object priors.

- Object pose estimation - The relative camera pose problem is transformed into estimating the object's pose between the two views. 

- Image matching - The query view is matched against a set of generated novel views of the object to estimate its pose and thereby determine the relative camera geometry.

- Generalization ability - Experiments demonstrate the method generalizes well to real-world datasets compared to other state-of-the-art pose regression techniques.

- Visual odometry - An application of the method for improving visual odometry is demonstrated by using estimated relative poses to optimize the pose graph.

In summary, the key focus is on using object priors from diffusion models to enable accurate relative pose estimation between views with extreme changes, and key terms revolve around this central idea.
