## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a fast and accurate algorithm for automatically determining the anatomical position of every slice along the axial dimension in a CT scan. Unlike previous approaches that process each slice separately, the proposed method directly localizes only a fraction of the total slices and fits a robust linear model to map slice index to estimated position for the entire scan. This exploits the inherent linearity of axial CT scans to achieve dramatic reductions in computation time to under a second regardless of scan size, while also improving accuracy. The algorithm relies on a CNN classifier for slice-level localization, coupled with aggregation techniques for enhanced precision and noise robustness at the full scan level. Comprehensive testing shows state-of-the-art median localization errors around 1 cm across a wide variety of challenging cases. A confidence score is introduced to detect unreliable localizations, allowing the method to reliably process nearly 98% of scans. By enabling precise, ultra-fast positioning as a preprocessing step, this algorithm promises to facilitate efficiency gains for downstream analysis tasks.
