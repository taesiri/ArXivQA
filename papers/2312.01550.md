# [Using human and robot synthetic data for training smart hand tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01550)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for activity recognition of smart hand tools by leveraging synthetically generated data to train machine learning models. The authors develop a prototype smart rotary tool equipped with sensors like an IMU, microphone, and current sensor. They generate synthetic sensor data mimicking real tool usage by mounting this instrumented tool on a Yaskawa robot arm programmed to execute motions for tasks like routing, sanding, engraving and cutting. Comparative analysis reveals that fine-tuning a model pre-trained on this synthetic data significantly improves accuracy for classifying human tool use data over training from scratch. Experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique to boost performance when adapted to individual tool operators. The methodology offers a promising direction for smart tool development by harnessing robotic capabilities for scalable synthetic data collection to overcome data scarcity challenges posed by reliance solely on human operators. Contributions also include releasing datasets and models to the research community.
