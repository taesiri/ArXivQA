# [False Positive Sampling-based Data Augmentation for Enhanced 3D Object   Detection Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ground truth (GT) sampling is commonly used in 3D object detection to address limited labeled data, but it increases false positives as the model becomes overconfident from excessive positive samples.

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper proposes a new data augmentation technique called False Positive (FP) sampling, which involves retraining the model using point clouds that were previously falsely detected by the model as objects. 

- An FP sample database is constructed by taking previous false positive predictions of the model and storing them to insert into future training scenes. This database is updated periodically.

- FP sampling is combined with GT sampling during training. GT sampling improves recall while FP sampling enhances precision. Together they balance the model and refine the decision boundary.

- A score-based curriculum sampling strategy is introduced where easy, moderate and hard samples are progressively used over epochs, inspired by curriculum learning principles.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of FP sampling technique to reduce false positives in 3D detection.

- Demonstrating FP sampling as a universal technique by testing on various models (PointPillars, CenterPoint, SECOND, PV-RCNN) and datasets (KITTI, Waymo).

- Enhancing model training efficiency and performance by incorporating curriculum learning principles into the sampling strategy.

- Experiments show models with FP sampling substantially outperform baselines in 3D detection, especially for pedestrian objects prone to false positives. For example, 57.22% mAP on KITTI pedestrians for SECOND model, a 7.78% increase over GT sampling alone.
