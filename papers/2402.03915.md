# [Learning Metrics that Maximise Power for Accelerated A/B-Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03915)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- A/B testing is important for decision making in online businesses, but experiments are often expensive due to requiring long runtimes or large sample sizes to achieve statistical significance. This leads to slow experiment velocity and high costs. 
- North Star metrics like revenue or retention that indicate business impact are typically delayed and not very sensitive. As a result, experiments on them have high rates of inconclusive outcomes (type II errors).

Proposed Solution:
- Learn optimized metrics from short-term signals that directly maximize the statistical power for detecting impact on the North Star metric.
- Existing approaches that maximize average z-score can overfit and do not necessarily reduce type II errors. They are also prone to type III errors (disagreement with the North Star).
- Instead, minimize the p-values that would have been obtained on past experiments. This more evenly distributes gains over experiments instead of a few very significant results. Also penalizes disagreement more strongly.

Main Contributions:
- Novel objectives to optimize p-values or log-transformed p-values instead of just z-scores when learning metrics. Reduces type II and III errors.  
- Spherical regularization technique to improve convergence speed of the optimization by up to 40%.
- Evaluation on 153 A/B experiments from two large-scale video platforms. Learned metrics increase power by 67-78% standalone, and 133-210% combined with North Star.
- Alternatively, learned metrics reduce required sample size to 12-15% of North Star at same power. Thus greatly decreases experimentation cost/time.

In summary, the paper presents an improved approach to learn optimized metrics that increase sensitivity and power for detecting experiment outcomes. This allows faster and cheaper A/B testing. The methods are demonstrated on real-world platforms.
