# [Explainable Contrastive and Cost-Sensitive Learning for Cervical Cancer   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Detecting cancerous cells from pap smear images is challenging and requires analysis by highly qualified pathologists, which is difficult to find in many countries. Computer-aided diagnosis tools using deep learning can help address this issue. However, existing studies have not addressed class imbalance, model interpretability, or leveraged contrastive learning for cervical cancer cell classification.  

Proposed Solution: This paper develops an efficient cervical cancer cell classification system using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Five CNN models (ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet-169, VGG16, VGG19) are fine-tuned on the SIPaKMeD dataset. Cost-sensitive learning is incorporated to minimize overall misclassification cost by prioritizing accuracy for more important classes. Supervised contrastive learning is added to help models better capture discriminative features and patterns. 

Main Contributions:
- Fine-tuned 5 CNN models and showed DenseNet-169 achieves best accuracy of 97.17% with fine-tuning
- Incorporated cost-sensitive learning to handle class imbalance; improved DenseNet-169 accuracy to 97.29%  
- Applied supervised contrastive learning; VGG16 achieves accuracy of 97.29%
- Implemented gradient and perturbation-based XAI techniques to interpret models' decisions
- Overall system outperforms prior studies in cervical cancer cell classification while providing interpretability

The system can classify cancer cell types from pap smear images with high accuracy while explaining its decisions, contributing towards automated cervical cancer screening tools.
