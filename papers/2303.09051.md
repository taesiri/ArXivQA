## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions/hypotheses that this paper addresses are:

1. Is the adjoint method the best way to generate adversarial examples with full gradients for evaluating diffusion-based purification methods? Is there a better alternative?

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. These methods aim to remove adversarial noise from images by using diffusion models to gradually add and remove noise. The authors first analyze current practices for evaluating these defenses, like using the adjoint method or AutoAttack. They find limitations, like the adjoint method relying on the solver's performance and AutoAttack being less effective than PGD+EOT. To address this, they propose using direct gradients of the defense and PGD+EOT for evaluation.  

Based on analysis of hyperparameters, the authors propose a new defense strategy called gradual noise scheduling. This uses fewer noise steps initially in the purification process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and SVHN show their method improves robustness over prior diffusion-based purification defenses. For example, on CIFAR-10 their method achieves 55.82% robust accuracy against PGD+EOT compared to 46.84% for DiffPure. The key contributions are analysis of evaluation practices for diffusion defenses, investigation of hyperparameters, and a new gradual noise scheduling strategy that improves robustness.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It questions the current evaluation practices for diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. These methods aim to remove adversarial perturbations from inputs at test time as an alternative to adversarial training. 

- Well-known white-box attacks like PGD and AutoAttack are often used to evaluate purification methods. But it is unclear if these attacks are the most effective for evaluating diffusion-based purification specifically. 

- The paper analyzes current evaluation practices and finds limitations:

1) The adjoint method used by some defenses to compute gradients relies on the performance of an underlying numerical solver. 

2) There is no comprehensive comparison of attacks using the full gradient.

- The paper proposes using a "surrogate process" to approximate gradients instead of the adjoint method. Experiments show this leads to lower robust accuracy than claimed in prior work.

- Comparisons show PGD is more effective than AutoAttack for diffusion-based purification.

- The paper also analyzes the impact of hyperparameters like number of noise steps. A new multi-step purification strategy with gradual noise scheduling is proposed and shown to improve robustness.

This paper analyzes the evaluation methods and hyperparameters used for diffusion-based adversarial purification defenses. The authors find that current practices like using AutoAttack and the adjoint method to calculate gradients may not be ideal for evaluating diffusion-based defenses.
