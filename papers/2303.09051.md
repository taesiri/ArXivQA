# [Robust Evaluation of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions/hypotheses that this paper addresses are:

1. Is the adjoint method the best way to generate adversarial examples with full gradients for evaluating diffusion-based purification methods? Is there a better alternative?

2. Is AutoAttack still more effective than other gradient-based attacks like PGD when full gradients of the defense are available? 

3. Is BPDA still more effective than the best combination of full-gradient attacks in evaluating diffusion-based purifications?

To summarize, the key research questions revolve around identifying the most effective way to evaluate the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods against white-box attacks. Specifically, the authors question current practices that use the adjoint method, AutoAttack, and BPDA for evaluation, and explore whether better alternatives exist. The overall goal is to establish a rigorous evaluation framework to accurately measure the robustness of diffusion-based purifications.
