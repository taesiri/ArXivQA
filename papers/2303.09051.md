# [Robust Evaluation of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions/hypotheses that this paper addresses are:

1. Is the adjoint method the best way to generate adversarial examples with full gradients for evaluating diffusion-based purification methods? Is there a better alternative?

2. Is AutoAttack still more effective than other gradient-based attacks like PGD when full gradients of the defense are available? 

3. Is BPDA still more effective than the best combination of full-gradient attacks in evaluating diffusion-based purifications?

To summarize, the key research questions revolve around identifying the most effective way to evaluate the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods against white-box attacks. Specifically, the authors question current practices that use the adjoint method, AutoAttack, and BPDA for evaluation, and explore whether better alternatives exist. The overall goal is to establish a rigorous evaluation framework to accurately measure the robustness of diffusion-based purifications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a study on evaluating the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. The main contributions are:

1. Analysis of current evaluation practices for diffusion-based purification methods:

- Question the use of adjoint method for calculating gradients, propose using a surrogate process as an alternative. Finds the surrogate process leads to lower robust accuracy than reported with adjoint method.

- Compare PGD+EOT and AutoAttack as attacks. Finds PGD+EOT is more effective than AutoAttack for diffusion-based purification. 

- Compare attacks using full gradients vs BPDA. Full gradient attacks are more effective.

2. Analysis of hyperparameters like number of forward/denoising steps, purification steps, and their impact on robustness. 

3. Proposes a new gradual noise scheduling strategy for multi-step purification that improves robustness over prior diffusion-based purification methods.

In summary, the paper provides an improved evaluation methodology for diffusion-based purification methods, analyzes hyperparameters, and proposes a new defense strategy that enhances robustness. The key contribution is a more rigorous framework for evaluating these methods.

- Explore how different hyperparameters like forward/denoising steps affect robustness of diffusion-based purification. The authors analyze some hyperparameters but more comprehensive studies could further optimize diffusion purification.

- Design new diffusion-based purification strategies that are more robust to adversarial attacks. The authors propose a gradual noise scheduling approach that improves robustness, but there is room for more innovations in purification techniques. 

- Apply insights from analyzing diffusion purification to other generative model-based purification methods. The issues highlighted in this paper may extend to evaluating and improving purification defenses based on other generative models like GANs.

- Combine diffusion purification with adversarial training in an effective way. The authors show existing combinations underperform, but better integration could potentially combine the benefits of both.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper analyzes the evaluation practices for diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. These methods aim to remove adversarial perturbations from inputs at test time using diffusion models. The authors find issues with the current practices, such as reliance on the adjoint method for computing gradients. They provide recommendations for more robust evaluation, like using the PGD attack over AutoAttack. The paper also analyzes how hyperparameters like forward steps impact robustness. Based on this analysis, the authors propose a new defense strategy called gradual noise scheduling that schedules forward steps and improves upon prior purification techniques. Through empirical evaluation, they demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed strategy against alternative purification and adversarial training methods. Overall, the paper provides guidance on evaluating and improving diffusion-based purification techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. These methods aim to remove adversarial noise from images by using diffusion models to gradually add and remove noise. The authors first analyze current practices for evaluating these defenses, like using the adjoint method or AutoAttack. They find limitations, like the adjoint method relying on the solver's performance and AutoAttack being less effective than PGD+EOT. To address this, they propose using direct gradients of the defense and PGD+EOT for evaluation.  

Based on analysis of hyperparameters, the authors propose a new defense strategy called gradual noise scheduling. This uses fewer noise steps initially in the purification process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and SVHN show their method improves robustness over prior diffusion-based purification defenses. For example, on CIFAR-10 their method achieves 55.82% robust accuracy against PGD+EOT compared to 46.84% for DiffPure. The key contributions are analysis of evaluation practices for diffusion defenses, investigation of hyperparameters, and a new gradual noise scheduling strategy that improves robustness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an evaluation of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. The main method used is:

- Analyzing the current evaluation practices for diffusion-based purification methods, including the use of adjoint methods to compute gradients and reliance on AutoAttack for evaluation. 

- Proposing alternatives, including using a surrogate process to approximate gradients when backpropagation is infeasible, and showing that PGD+EOT is more effective than AutoAttack for evaluating purification methods.

- Investigating the influence of various hyperparameters like number of forward/denoising steps and purification iterations on the robustness of purification methods.

- Based on this analysis, proposing a new defense strategy called gradual noise scheduling, which uses fewer forward steps initially and then increases them. This is shown to improve robustness over prior purification techniques.

In summary, the paper thoroughly analyzes the evaluation and hyperparameters of diffusion-based purification methods, and proposes improvements to evaluation and a new defense strategy to achieve higher robustness compared to prior work. The key method is careful analysis of the properties of diffusion models for purification and tuning them appropriately for improved robustness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It questions the current evaluation practices for diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. These methods aim to remove adversarial perturbations from inputs at test time as an alternative to adversarial training. 

- Well-known white-box attacks like PGD and AutoAttack are often used to evaluate purification methods. But it is unclear if these attacks are the most effective for evaluating diffusion-based purification specifically. 

- The paper analyzes current evaluation practices and finds limitations:

1) The adjoint method used by some defenses to compute gradients relies on the performance of an underlying numerical solver. 

2) There is no comprehensive comparison of attacks using the full gradient.

- The paper proposes using a "surrogate process" to approximate gradients instead of the adjoint method. Experiments show this leads to lower robust accuracy than claimed in prior work.

- Comparisons show PGD is more effective than AutoAttack for diffusion-based purification.

- The paper also analyzes the impact of hyperparameters like number of noise steps. A new multi-step purification strategy with gradual noise scheduling is proposed and shown to improve robustness.

In summary, the key contribution is questioning and improving the evaluation of diffusion-based purification defenses against adversarial attacks. The paper provides an analysis of limitations of current practices and recommendations for more robust evaluation.
