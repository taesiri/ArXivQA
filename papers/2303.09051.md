# [Robust Evaluation of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions/hypotheses that this paper addresses are:

1. Is the adjoint method the best way to generate adversarial examples with full gradients for evaluating diffusion-based purification methods? Is there a better alternative?

2. Is AutoAttack still more effective than other gradient-based attacks like PGD when full gradients of the defense are available? 

3. Is BPDA still more effective than the best combination of full-gradient attacks in evaluating diffusion-based purifications?

To summarize, the key research questions revolve around identifying the most effective way to evaluate the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods against white-box attacks. Specifically, the authors question current practices that use the adjoint method, AutoAttack, and BPDA for evaluation, and explore whether better alternatives exist. The overall goal is to establish a rigorous evaluation framework to accurately measure the robustness of diffusion-based purifications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a study on evaluating the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. The main contributions are:

1. Analysis of current evaluation practices for diffusion-based purification methods:

- Question the use of adjoint method for calculating gradients, propose using a surrogate process as an alternative. Finds the surrogate process leads to lower robust accuracy than reported with adjoint method.

- Compare PGD+EOT and AutoAttack as attacks. Finds PGD+EOT is more effective than AutoAttack for diffusion-based purification. 

- Compare attacks using full gradients vs BPDA. Full gradient attacks are more effective.

2. Analysis of hyperparameters like number of forward/denoising steps, purification steps, and their impact on robustness. 

3. Proposes a new gradual noise scheduling strategy for multi-step purification that improves robustness over prior diffusion-based purification methods.

In summary, the paper provides an improved evaluation methodology for diffusion-based purification methods, analyzes hyperparameters, and proposes a new defense strategy that enhances robustness. The key contribution is a more rigorous framework for evaluating these methods.
