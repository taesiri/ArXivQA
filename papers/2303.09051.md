# [Robust Evaluation of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions/hypotheses that this paper addresses are:

1. Is the adjoint method the best way to generate adversarial examples with full gradients for evaluating diffusion-based purification methods? Is there a better alternative?

2. Is AutoAttack still more effective than other gradient-based attacks like PGD when full gradients of the defense are available? 

3. Is BPDA still more effective than the best combination of full-gradient attacks in evaluating diffusion-based purifications?

To summarize, the key research questions revolve around identifying the most effective way to evaluate the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods against white-box attacks. Specifically, the authors question current practices that use the adjoint method, AutoAttack, and BPDA for evaluation, and explore whether better alternatives exist. The overall goal is to establish a rigorous evaluation framework to accurately measure the robustness of diffusion-based purifications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a study on evaluating the robustness of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. The main contributions are:

1. Analysis of current evaluation practices for diffusion-based purification methods:

- Question the use of adjoint method for calculating gradients, propose using a surrogate process as an alternative. Finds the surrogate process leads to lower robust accuracy than reported with adjoint method.

- Compare PGD+EOT and AutoAttack as attacks. Finds PGD+EOT is more effective than AutoAttack for diffusion-based purification. 

- Compare attacks using full gradients vs BPDA. Full gradient attacks are more effective.

2. Analysis of hyperparameters like number of forward/denoising steps, purification steps, and their impact on robustness. 

3. Proposes a new gradual noise scheduling strategy for multi-step purification that improves robustness over prior diffusion-based purification methods.

In summary, the paper provides an improved evaluation methodology for diffusion-based purification methods, analyzes hyperparameters, and proposes a new defense strategy that enhances robustness. The key contribution is a more rigorous framework for evaluating these methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes current evaluation practices for diffusion-based adversarial purification methods, proposes recommendations for more robust evaluation, investigates the influence of hyperparameters, and introduces a new gradual noise-scheduling strategy that improves the robustness of diffusion-based purification against adversarial attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a thorough evaluation and analysis of diffusion-based adversarial purification methods. Here are some key points on how it compares to other related work:

- Focus on diffusion-based purification: This paper specifically focuses on analyzing diffusion-based approaches for adversarial purification, such as DiffPure and GDMP. It provides a focused and in-depth look at evaluating and improving this class of defenses. 

- Questioning evaluation practices: The paper critically examines common practices used for evaluating purification defenses, such as reliance on AutoAttack and BPDA. It argues these may not be ideal for diffusion-based methods and proposes better evaluation techniques.

- Analysis of hyperparameters: The paper systematically analyzes how hyperparameters like number of diffusion steps impact robustness of purification defenses from both the attacker and defender viewpoints. This provides useful insights for parameter tuning.

- Proposed improvements: Based on the analysis, the paper proposes a new gradual noise scheduling strategy that improves robustness over prior diffusion-based purification techniques.

- Rigorous evaluation: The robustness improvements are demonstrated through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets against various adaptive attacks. This provides convincing evidence of the proposed method's effectiveness.

Overall, this paper stands out for its focus on rigorously evaluating and improving diffusion-based purification defenses specifically. The in-depth analysis and proposed improvements help advance the state-of-the-art in this domain. The critical view on evaluation practices also serves to improve the robustness evaluation of adaptive defenses more broadly.
