# [Enhancing Trust in Autonomous Agents: An Architecture for Accountability   and Explainability through Blockchain and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The increasing deployment of autonomous agents like robots in public environments raises security concerns regarding their ability to justify actions and decisions, especially in safety-critical scenarios. There is a need for reliable and tamper-proof logging of events during agent actions to enable post-event forensic analysis. Additionally, the logged data needs to be transformed into natural language explanations that are understandable by non-expert humans, to improve trust and prevent failures or misunderstandings.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an accountability and explainability architecture with two key components:

1) A tamper-proof black box recorder that securely logs essential data from the agent's actions using blockchain technology to ensure data immutability and enable integrity verification. Selective message hashes are stored periodically in the blockchain. 

2) An explainability component that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate natural language explanations for the logged data. The logged data is processed to extract relevant details and this is used to augment prompts for the LLM to generate coherent and understandable explanations.

Key Contributions:

- Accountability architecture using blockchain to address real-time logging challenges in robotic systems regarding integrity and verifiability of recorded events 

- Explainability solution harnessing RAG and LLM to transform logged data into natural language explanations for non-experts

- Enhanced trust, security and human interpretability for autonomous agents through tamper-proof logging and explainable decision making

- Comprehensive experimental evaluation on ROS-based mobile robot covering performance, correctness and quality assessment of logging and explanation generation

The proposed architecture offers an effective approach to improve the security, safety and transparency of autonomous agents, especially in human-facing applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an accountability and explainability architecture for ROS-based mobile robots, using blockchain technology to ensure data integrity in a black box recorder and large language models to generate natural language explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two key components:

1) A black box-like component to provide accountability. This component features anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology to ensure data immutability. 

2) An explainability component responsible for generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the black box component. 

The paper evaluates the performance of this integrated accountability and explainability solution across three different navigation scenarios for autonomous agents. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable natural language explanations.

The paper's contributions aim to enhance trustworthiness, prevent failures/errors, and improve communication between autonomous agents and non-expert users. The proposed architecture and its comprehensive assessment provide a basis for future research on accountable and explainable autonomous agents.
