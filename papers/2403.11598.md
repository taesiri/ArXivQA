# [Optimal Layout Synthesis for Deep Quantum Circuits on NISQ Processors   with 100+ Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Quantum computers have limited qubit connectivity, so two-qubit gates can only be applied between connected qubits. This requires inserting SWAP gates to route qubits, increasing circuit depth and gate count.
- Optimal layout synthesis is finding a mapping with the minimum number of additional SWAP gates, but prior exact methods do not scale beyond small circuits.
- Heuristic methods are fast but produce suboptimal mappings with too many SWAPs, increasing errors.

Proposed Solution: 
- Encode the problem as a parallel SAT planning problem, where each step maps 1 SWAP and multiple CNOTs. This reduces plan length for better scalability compared to planning approaches that map 1 gate per step.
- Propagate CNOT dependencies bidirectionally using advanced and delayed CNOT variables for better efficiency. 
- Additional techniques like qubit bridges and relaxed CNOT dependencies based on commutation rules are also incorporated.

Main Contributions:
- A scalable Two-Way parallel SAT encoding for optimal layout synthesis that significantly outperforms prior exact and heuristic methods.
- Experimental results showing the approach can optimally map 8-qubit circuits needing up to 14 SWAPs to a 127-qubit quantum processor, a problem size unattainable by prior exact techniques.
- Demonstration that bridges and relaxed CNOT dependencies can further reduce SWAP+bridge gate count.
- An open-source tool Q-Synth2 implementing the ideas, outperforming a leading near-optimal tool by up to 100x.
