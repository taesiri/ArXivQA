# [MedSumm: A Multimodal Approach to Summarizing Code-Mixed Hindi-English   Clinical Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for better doctor-patient communication and medical decision making. Summarizing medical questions posed by patients is critical for this. 
- Prior work on medical question summarization (MQS) has focused only on text, overlooking integration of visual cues which can improve accuracy.
- MQS work has also been limited to English only, overlooking code-mixed languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new task of multimodal medical question summarization for code-mixed Hindi-English input. 
- A new dataset called Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization (MMCQS) dataset is introduced combining textual queries and visual aids like symptom photos.
- A framework called MedSumm is proposed that utilizes pre-trained language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to generate summaries from the multimodal input.

Key Contributions:
- Novel task formulation for multimodal medical question summarization.
- Novel MMCQS dataset with over 3000 code-mixed medical questions and images. 
- Novel MedSumm framework leveraging LLMs and VLMs for the summarization task.
- Introduction of a new evaluation metric called Multimodal Fact Capturing Metric (MMFCM).
- Experiments showing MedSumm outperforming unimodal baselines, demonstrating the value of incorporating visual information.

The paper introduces an important new direction for medical question summarization. By integrating images with code-mixed textual queries, the proposed approach aims to provide better doctor-patient communication and understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new multimodal medical question summarization task and dataset combining Hindi-English codemixed queries and images, and proposes a framework called MedSumm that utilizes pre-trained language and vision models for generating summaries incorporating textual and visual information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel task of multimodal medical question summarization for generating medically nuanced summaries from code-mixed Hindi-English input. 

2) Introducing a new dataset called the Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization (MMCQS) dataset containing 3,015 medical questions with corresponding visual cues to enable research in this area.

3) Proposing a novel framework called MedSumm that employs pre-trained language models, vision encoders, and efficient fine-tuning techniques like QLoRA to integrate textual and visual information for summarizing multimodal clinical questions.

4) Defining a new evaluation metric called MMFCM to quantify how well models capture multimodal information in the generated summaries.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing the new task of multimodal medical question summarization for code-mixed input, along with a dataset, model architecture, and evaluation metric to enable progress in this important research direction.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called MMCQS. What was the motivation behind creating this new dataset and how is it different from existing datasets for medical question summarization?

2. The paper proposes a multimodal framework called MedSumm. Can you explain in detail the different components of MedSumm and how they work together to generate the final summaries?
