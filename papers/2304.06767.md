# RAFT: Reward rAnked FineTuning for Generative Foundation Model Alignment

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we effectively align generative foundation models like large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models with human preferences and ethics, in order to mitigate issues like implicit bias?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Reward Ranked Fine-Tuning (RAFT), a new framework that iteratively selects high-reward samples from a generative model and fine-tunes the model on those samples, can effectively align generative models with a reward function capturing human preferences. 2) Compared to prevailing approaches like PPO, RAFT offers advantages in stability, sample efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability due to its simpler SFT-like training procedure and preference-based sample ranking.3) RAFT can be applied to align both LLMs and diffusion models by using an appropriate reward model, with competitive or superior performance to PPO.So in summary, the central question is how to align generative models, and the main hypothesis is that the proposed RAFT framework provides an effective solution by leveraging reward-ranked fine-tuning. Both LLMs and diffusion models are considered as use cases to validate the effectiveness and flexibility of RAFT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The proposal of a new framework called RAFT (Reward rAnked FineTuning) for aligning generative models like large language models and diffusion models to human preferences/ethics using a reward function. 2. Demonstrating that RAFT can effectively improve model performance on both reward learning and automated metrics compared to supervised fine-tuning and policy-based reinforcement learning methods like PPO.3. Showing that RAFT works for both large language models and diffusion models, suggesting it could be applicable to other generative models as well.4. Highlighting some advantages of RAFT such as:- More stable and faster convergence compared to PPO due to the SFT-like training- Lower memory requirements by separating data generation and model fine-tuning- Flexibility in leveraging diverse data sources beyond on-policy samples- Robustness to reward scaling due to the ranking-based sample selection- Easier to interpret objective of learning from the induced best-of-K policy5. Providing extensive experiments on a large language model (LLaMA-7B) fine-tuned on the HH-RLHF dataset to demonstrate RAFT can improve alignment quality, as measured by reward and perplexity, compared to PPO and SFT baselines.6. Showing RAFT can also effectively improve sample quality and text-image alignment for diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing the RAFT framework as a simple yet effective approach for aligning generative models using human feedback, and demonstrating its advantages over prior methods empirically on both language and diffusion models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper introduces a new framework called RAFT for aligning generative models like large language models and diffusion models. This aligns with the growing interest in techniques to improve the reliability and fairness of these powerful generative models. The paper contributes a new approach to this active area of research.- Compared to prior alignment methods like PPO that use reinforcement learning, RAFT is more stable and efficient by leveraging supervised fine-tuning techniques. This contrasts with the trial-and-error nature and instability of RL algorithms. The simplicity of RAFT with fewer hyperparameters also distinguishes it from more complex RLHF methods.- The idea of using the generative model itself to generate additional training data for alignment seems to be novel compared to prior approaches. This self-learning process allows for more data while saving annotation costs. Related ideas have been explored for unlabeled data and model scaling, but using it specifically for alignment appears to be new.- The results demonstrate strong performance of RAFT on both language and image tasks, showing its versatility. Comparisons to PPO and ablations reveal its advantages in key metrics like reward, perplexity, and diversity. This empirically validates RAFT as a competitive alignment technique.- The human preference learning aspect connects RAFT to a lot of existing work on learning from human feedback signals. But RAFT's way of incorporating this into a generative model fine-tuning pipeline seems differentiated from prior human-in-the-loop approaches.Overall, RAFT appears to offer a novel and promising alignment framework that contrasts in important ways from previous methods. The empirical results support its effectiveness, while comparisons highlight its advantages. If validated more extensively, RAFT could become a leading alignment technique for generative models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more sophisticated reward modeling techniques that better capture complex human preferences and values. The authors note limitations of current reward modeling approaches.- Exploring how to effectively balance reward maximization with retaining strong language model capabilities like fluency and coherence. The authors discuss the need to mitigate "alignment tax".- Applying and evaluating the RAFT algorithm on other types of generative models beyond just large language models, such as GANs and visual generative models. The authors suggest RAFT could generalize.- Investigating the use of RAFT for purposes beyond just alignment, like performance improvement. The authors hint at this possibility in their LLM experiments.- Studying the interplay between prompt engineering and RAFT to further boost sample quality. The authors discuss in the appendix leveraging context and prompts.- Developing global ranking versions of RAFT that compare samples across prompts. The authors describe the current local ranking.- Analyzing and addressing potential "reward hacking" issues with monitoring selected samples. The authors mention this as an advantage of RAFT.- Considering combinations with expert human demonstrators or other high-quality data sources. The authors discuss teacher-student distillation experiments.- Applying more advanced search methods like beam search during the data collection phase. The authors mention this in the appendix.So in summary, the main directions seem to be improving reward modeling, balancing tradeoffs, generalizing across model types, mitigating reward hacking, incorporating human and external data, and enhancing the data collection and ranking components. The authors position RAFT as a new, competitive alignment algorithm with room for extensions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework called Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT) for aligning generative models like large language models and diffusion models with human preferences/ethics using a reward function. The key idea is to iteratively alternate between (1) sampling responses using the current generative model, (2) ranking the responses by the reward function and filtering to keep only high reward samples, and (3) fine-tuning the generative model on the filtered samples to reinforce generating high reward responses. Compared to prior work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for alignment, RAFT is more stable and computationally efficient since it separates sample generation from model fine-tuning. Experiments on aligning LLMs and diffusion models for moral/harmless text generation and controlled image generation show RAFT can effectively improve alignment in terms of reward functions while maintaining fluency and diversity. The interpretability and stability of the iterative process also helps address "reward hacking". Overall, RAFT provides an enhanced algorithm for aligning generative models to human preferences.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework called Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT) for aligning generative foundation models like large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. The goal is to fine-tune these models to align with human preferences and ethics, rather than just maximizing likelihood on a dataset which may contain biases. The key idea is to iteratively alternate between (1) generating samples from the model, (2) ranking the samples by a reward model, (3) selecting the top-ranked samples, and (4) fine-tuning the model on just those selected samples. This process repeats. Compared to prior work using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), RAFT is more stable and efficient since it is based on supervised fine-tuning rather than policy gradient. It also requires less GPU memory and is flexible to incorporate diverse data sources beyond just the model's own samples.Experiments on aligning LLMs using a helpful/harmless dataset and on adapting diffusion models to different resolutions and text prompts demonstrate RAFT's effectiveness. The fine-tuned models achieve higher reward while maintaining fluency and diversity. RAFT also obtains better reward-perplexity trade-offs compared to RLHF methods like PPO. Limitations are the need for a pre-trained reward model and potential reward hacking issues. Overall, RAFT offers a simple yet powerful approach for aligning generative models that is complementary to prior RLHF techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a new framework called Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT) for aligning generative models like large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to human preferences, as represented by a reward model. The key idea is to iteratively alternate between:1) Sampling responses from the current generative model.  2) Ranking the sampled responses by the reward model and filtering to the top-ranked subset.3) Fine-tuning the generative model on the filtered, high-reward subset of responses.By repeating this process, RAFT gradually improves the generative model to produce responses that score highly on the given reward model, which encodes human preferences. The method offers advantages over prior reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like PPO in terms of efficiency, stability, and flexibility across different generative models. Experiments on LLMs and diffusion models demonstrate RAFT's ability to effectively improve alignment with a reward model while maintaining generation quality. Overall, RAFT provides a simple but powerful approach for aligning generative models without the complications of RL algorithms.
