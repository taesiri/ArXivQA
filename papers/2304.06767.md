# RAFT: Reward rAnked FineTuning for Generative Foundation Model Alignment

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we effectively align generative foundation models like large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models with human preferences and ethics, in order to mitigate issues like implicit bias?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Reward Ranked Fine-Tuning (RAFT), a new framework that iteratively selects high-reward samples from a generative model and fine-tunes the model on those samples, can effectively align generative models with a reward function capturing human preferences. 2) Compared to prevailing approaches like PPO, RAFT offers advantages in stability, sample efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability due to its simpler SFT-like training procedure and preference-based sample ranking.3) RAFT can be applied to align both LLMs and diffusion models by using an appropriate reward model, with competitive or superior performance to PPO.So in summary, the central question is how to align generative models, and the main hypothesis is that the proposed RAFT framework provides an effective solution by leveraging reward-ranked fine-tuning. Both LLMs and diffusion models are considered as use cases to validate the effectiveness and flexibility of RAFT.
