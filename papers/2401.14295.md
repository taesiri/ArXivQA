# [Topologies of Reasoning: Demystifying Chains, Trees, and Graphs of   Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of structure-enhanced reasoning techniques for large language models (LLMs). As LLMs have become dominant in machine learning, prompt engineering has emerged as a key technique to effectively query these models. However, crafting effective prompts for complex reasoning tasks remains challenging. 

To address this, recent works have proposed techniques that guide the LLM through intermediate reasoning steps structured as chains, trees or graphs. This paper refers to these structures that model the reasoning process as "reasoning topologies".

The key contributions are:

1) A general blueprint of the prompt execution pipeline, clearly defining concepts like prompts, thoughts, solutions, context updates etc.

2) A novel taxonomy of structure-enhanced reasoning techniques, based on aspects like topology class, topology scope, representation and construction method. This structures the landscape and clarifies differences.

3) A survey of existing methods based on the taxonomy, analyzing topology variants, performance tradeoffs regarding accuracy vs latency/cost, representation formats and more.

4) An extensive performance analysis, investigating accuracy patterns across domains like arithmetic, symbolic and commonsense reasoning for chain, tree and graph topologies.

5) A discussion of open challenges, including exploring new topology classes, improving single-prompt approaches currently dominated by multi-prompt schemes, automatically constructing topologies, and enhancements regarding scalability, retrieval and graph-based techniques.

Overall, this is the first work providing extensive foundations and a unifying framework for structure-enhanced reasoning techniques. By clarifying terminology, structuring the design space and highlighting tradeoffs, it will propel more efficient prompt engineering methods.
