# [Dynamic Dense Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-based Human   Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17408)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Dynamic Dense Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN) for skeleton-based human motion prediction. The key ideas are: (1) Construct a dense graph with 4D adjacency to represent the motion sequence comprehensively at multiple levels of abstraction, enabling effective capture of long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. (2) Propose a novel dynamic message passing framework, where aggregators learn sample-specific relevance between nodes to generate distinctive messages, providing higher representational capacity with few extra parameters. The overall network leverages these two components, adopting a multi-pathway architecture performing single-level and cross-level feature propagation over the dense graph. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, especially on an extremely long-term prediction task. The qualitative analysis provides insights on how the model captures common patterns via shared adjacency and distinctive patterns via dynamic adjacency. The main advantages are modeling complex motion structures effectively and efficiently. Potential limitations lie in predicting still poses following observed movements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dynamic dense graph convolutional network (DD-GCN) with a novel graph construction and message passing framework to effectively model complex spatial-temporal dependencies in skeleton-based human motion prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It presents a dense graph with 4D adjacency modeling to represent the motion sequence at different levels of abstraction as a whole from a global perspective. This enables efficient capture of long-range spatio-temporal dependencies to facilitate motion prediction.

2. It proposes a novel dynamic message passing framework, wherein the aggregators learn dynamically from data and generate informative messages by exploiting sample-specific relevance among nodes. This provides higher interpretability and representational capacity while requiring very few extra parameters. 

3. It develops a dynamic dense graph convolutional network (DD-GCN) that leverages the two proposals above in conjunction. The DD-GCN adopts a multi-pathway framework to perform feature learning at and across different levels. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both traditional and extremely long-term motion prediction tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is a new dynamic dense graph convolutional network for skeleton-based human motion prediction, which involves innovations in graph construction, message passing, and overall network architecture design.
