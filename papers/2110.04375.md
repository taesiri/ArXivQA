# [Neural Link Prediction with Walk Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we design a graph neural network model for link prediction that better leverages topological information compared to existing methods? The key hypothesis is that current graph neural network models for link prediction do not adequately capture higher-order topological correlations, such as network motifs, due to their reliance on suboptimal pooling schemes. The paper proposes a new pooling method called WalkPool to address this limitation.In summary, the main research question is how to improve link prediction performance of GNNs by designing a pooling scheme that better encodes topological information beyond two-body correlations. The hypothesis is that the proposed WalkPool method will achieve this by capturing higher-order network motifs and topological patterns.
