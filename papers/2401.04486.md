# [Take A Shortcut Back: Mitigating the Gradient Vanishing for Training   Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible and energy-efficient than traditional artificial neural networks. However, training SNNs is challenging due to the non-differentiability of the spiking activation function. 
- Existing surrogate gradient methods suffer from severe gradient vanishing problem, where gradients decay exponentially and can't update weights of early layers. This is analyzed theoretically and shown experimentally.

Proposed Solution:
- A shortcut backpropagation method is proposed to directly propagate gradients from loss to early layers, bypassing intermediate layers.
- Multiple shortcut connections are added from intermediate layers to output. Each shortcut output is weighted and combined into final loss. 
- An evolutionary training framework is used where weight of main branch is increased and shortcuts decreased over epochs. This balances early layer updates and final accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Identified fundamental gradient vanishing problem in SNNs, through equations and experiments.
- A simple yet effective shortcut backpropagation method that presents gradients directly to early layers, mitigating vanishing gradients.
- An evolutionary training strategy that automatically balances between accuracy and ease of training.
- State-of-the-art results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets, using ResNet18 and 34. Up to 1.44% better accuracy compared to recent methods.
- Showcased first SNN model surpassing 83% on neuromorphic CIFAR10-DVS dataset.

In summary, this paper makes SNNs much easier to train by addressing the gradient vanishing problem using shortcut connections and evolutionary training. It achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple datasets with higher accuracy and smaller models. The method is simple, efficient and does not add any computational burden at inference time.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the gradient vanishing problem in SNNs is more severe than in ANNs. Why is this the case? Explain both theoretically and experimentally. 

2. The shortcut back-propagation method directly presents gradients from the output layer to shallow layers. How does this help mitigate gradient vanishing compared to traditional backpropagation?

3. The evolutionary training framework uses a balance coefficient λ that changes dynamically during training. Explain the rationale behind starting with a higher λ value and decreasing it over time. 

4. Shortcut connections can increase training time and model complexity. Does the proposed method introduce any overhead during inference? Explain.  

5. The method trains an ensemble of branches with weighted outputs. How are the loss functions and gradients calculated for each branch? How are they combined?

6. Ablation studies show better accuracy with evolutionary training versus just shortcut backprop. Quantitatively analyze the improvements. Why does this two-step method work better?  

7. For deeper networks like ResNet34, the proposed method gives much larger gains over baseline training. Explain why the method helps more with increasing depth.

8. The method surpasses state-of-the-art on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Analyze the results and explain why it achieves better accuracy.

9. The largest gains are seen on the neuromorphic CIFAR10-DVS dataset. Why might the method be especially suited for spatiotemporal, event-based datasets?

10. The shortcut branches are removed after training for inference. How might the method change if some branches were left in place? Would this help further improve accuracy or efficiency?
