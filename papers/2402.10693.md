# [Exploring Precision and Recall to assess the quality and diversity of   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10693)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional metrics for evaluating large language models (LLMs) like perplexity are limited as they focus only on surface form and quality of individual samples, not diversity. 
- Existing benchmarks rely on specific tasks with verifiable answers, not open-ended text generation.
- Metrics like BLEU/ROUGE require alignment between generated and human references.
- New distribution-based metrics like MAUVE summarize quality and diversity into one diverence measure, making interpretation challenging. 

Solution:
- The paper introduces Precision and Recall metrics adapted from image generation to assess quality and diversity of LLM text generation without needing aligned corpora. 
- Precision captures the quality/adequacy of generated distributions.
- Recall captures the diversity of generated distributions.
- Estimated by projecting text into latent space via GPT-2 embeddings and KDE-based support estimation.

Contributions:
- Propose novel metrics offering nuanced assessment of quality and diversity tradeoffs in open-ended LLM text generation.
- Evaluate prominent LLMs like Llama-2 and Mistral on tasks like WebText generation, Wikipedia biography generation.
- Find instruction tuning improves quality but reduces diversity. Larger models generate more diverse text.
- Show inadequacy of perplexity and limitations of MAUVE in distinguishing quality and diversity.
- Provide better understanding of strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for open-ended generation.

The proposed Precision and Recall metrics significantly advance the toolkit for evaluating LLMs, capturing quality and diversity tradeoffs not revealed by existing methods. Thorough analysis offers insights into generation capabilities and challenges of current models.
