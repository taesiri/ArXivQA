# [Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models: In-Depth Analysis on the   Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been too focused on end results rather than the reasoning process itself. This makes it difficult to properly assess LLMs' inference and contextual understanding capabilities.  
- The Abstract and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) requires rigorous logical reasoning to solve problems, making it a good benchmark to compare LLM reasoning abilities to humans. Experiments show LLMs still lag behind humans in ARC accuracy.
- There is a lack of in-depth analysis into how LLMs reason and how their reasoning differs from humans. Hence, there are calls for a shift from results-focused evaluation to analyzing the reasoning process itself.

Solution:
- The paper adopts the Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) perspective to evaluate reasoning abilities based on the process rather than just outcomes. 
- LoTH posits reasoning involves manipulating mental representations and encompasses 3 key characteristics: logical coherence, compositionality and productivity.
- The paper designs 3 experiments using ARC tasks to assess these aspects in LLMs:
  1) Logical coherence: Use prompting techniques to solve ARC tasks and analyze process 
  2) Compositionality: Provide functions to manipulate ARC inputs and assess if LLMs can combine functions appropriately
  3) Productivity: Test if LLMs can generate new valid input-output pairs for ARC tasks

Key Contributions:
- Confirmation that LLMs have basic image understanding and can do simple object manipulations
- However, compared to humans, LLMs are weak in:
  1) Understanding concepts like objectness in images
  2) Logical reasoning abilities, especially in a step-by-step manner 
  3) Understanding and generating unseen representations
- Analysis of LLM reasoning aligned with components of human reasoning provides a new perspective to advance LLM reasoning capabilities  

In summary, the paper introduces a differentiated approach to evaluate LLM reasoning based on logical coherence, compositionality and productivity. The experiments and analysis provide insights into current gaps in LLM reasoning versus human cognition, as well as future research directions.
