# [Efficient Second-Order Plane Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we efficiently solve the plane adjustment (PA) problem using Newton's method, taking advantage of the fact that the optimal plane parameters are functions of the sensor poses?

The key points are:

- The PA problem involves jointly optimizing planes and sensor poses to minimize point-to-plane distance, similar to bundle adjustment (BA) which optimizes 3D points and camera poses. 

- Typically Gauss-Newton methods are used for BA and PA because computing the full Hessian for Newton's method is too expensive for large problems.

- However, in PA the optimal planes can be eliminated and expressed as functions of the poses. This significantly reduces the variables and allows Newton's method to be applied. 

- The main challenge is efficiently computing the Hessian and gradient for the reduced PA cost function. 

- This paper provides closed-form solutions to compute the Hessian and gradient, enabling efficient Newton's method for PA.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by eliminating planes and efficiently computing the Hessian/gradient, Newton's method can outperform Gauss-Newton for the PA problem. The paper aims to demonstrate this through deriving the mathematical solutions and evaluating empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient second-order plane adjustment algorithm using Newton's method. Specifically:

- It takes advantage of the property that the optimal planes can be eliminated and expressed as functions of only the sensor poses. This significantly reduces the number of variables. 

- It provides closed-form solutions to efficiently compute the Hessian matrix and gradient vector of the resulting cost function, which only depends on poses. Previous works could not efficiently compute these, limiting the use of Newton's method.

- By efficiently computing the Hessian matrix and ensuring optimal plane estimations, it is able to achieve faster convergence compared to common first-order methods like Levenberg-Marquardt.

So in summary, the key contribution is an efficient way to leverage the second-order Newton's method for plane adjustment by eliminating planes and deriving closed-form solutions for the required derivatives. This results in faster convergence than typical first-order approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper provides an efficient second-order optimization algorithm for plane adjustment that exploits the property that the optimal planes can be eliminated as variables by expressing them as functions of the sensor poses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on efficient second-order plane adjustment compares to other research in 3D reconstruction using depth sensors:

- It focuses specifically on the plane adjustment (PA) problem, which optimizes both planes and sensor poses to minimize point-to-plane distances. This is an important problem for depth sensor based 3D reconstruction.

- Most prior work applies standard solutions from bundle adjustment (BA) in vision to PA. This paper argues that PA has special structure that can be exploited - specifically, the optimal planes can be eliminated and computed from the poses. 

- The key challenge is efficiently computing the Hessian and gradient for pose-only PA. Prior work either uses inefficient formulas or approximates the Hessian. This paper derives an efficient closed-form solution.

- The proposed second-order Newton method for PA outperforms standard techniques like the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in convergence speed. This is unlike vision where Newton methods are considered too costly.

- The experiments focus on evaluating convergence speed and robustness for different noise levels on real LiDAR datasets. Most prior PA papers do not have extensive quantitative evaluation.

So in summary, this paper provides novel theoretical insight into the structure of PA, an efficient algorithm for exploiting it, and strong quantitative experiments demonstrating the advantages. The results challenge conventional wisdom that Newton methods are infeasible for large problems like PA. This could impact how similar geometric vision/robotics problems are solved.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion:

- Extending the proposed second-order plane adjustment algorithm to use the Schur complement for solving large-scale problems. They note their current algorithm has complexity similar to using the Schur complement, but do not implement it.

- Exploring other parameterizations of the rotation besides the Cayley-Gibbs-Rodriguez parameterization used in the paper. They suggest the angle-axis or quaternion representations may offer benefits.

- Applying the proposed algorithm to real-time plane-based SLAM systems and evaluating the performance improvements compared to existing methods. They suggest integrating it into methods like LOAM or Pi-LO.

- Generalizing the proposed approach to other geometric primitives beyond planes, such as lines or spheres. The key would be efficiently computing the Hessian for these other primitives.

- Exploring the use of second-order methods like Newton's method for other large-scale geometric vision problems like bundle adjustment. They note the ingrained idea these are too expensive to compute and their work challenges that for plane adjustment.

In summary, the main suggestions are extending the algorithm for large-scale problems, integrating it into SLAM systems, generalizing to other primitives, and inspiring more second-order methods in geometric vision. The authors frame their work as an initial exploration of second-order plane adjustment that can motivate many exciting research directions.

This CVPR 2023 paper focuses on the problem of plane adjustment (PA), which involves jointly optimizing planes and sensor poses to minimize the sum of squared point-to-plane distances. The authors adopt Newton's method to efficiently solve the large-scale PA problem by taking advantage of the fact that optimal planes are functions of the poses.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on the problem of estimating optimal planes and sensor poses to minimize the point-to-plane distance, referred to as plane adjustment (PA). PA is important for 3D reconstruction using depth sensors like RGB-D cameras and LiDARs. The PA problem is similar to bundle adjustment (BA) in visual reconstruction, where points and camera poses are jointly optimized to minimize reprojection error. However, in PA the optimal planes can be eliminated so the cost function only depends on sensor poses, significantly reducing the number of variables. But computing the Hessian matrix and gradient for this cost function is difficult. 

This paper provides an efficient solution using Newton's method for PA. By exploiting the relationship between optimal planes and poses, the authors derive closed-form solutions for the Hessian matrix and gradient vector whose complexity is independent of number of points. This allows Newton's method to efficiently solve even large-scale PA problems, unlike previous works. Empirical results demonstrate their algorithm converges much faster than the widely used Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The key contribution is an efficient way to compute the Hessian and gradient for PA with poses as the only variables.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is to formulate the plane adjustment (PA) problem by eliminating the plane parameters and only optimizing the sensor poses. Specifically, they take advantage of the fact that the optimal plane parameters can be determined analytically by the current estimated poses. By substituting the optimal plane estimation into the PA cost function, they obtain a cost that only depends on the sensor poses. This significantly reduces the number of variables in the optimization. Then they use Newton's method to minimize this pose-only cost function. The key contribution is providing an efficient way to compute the Hessian matrix and gradient vector for this pose-only cost function, which enables the use of Newton's method. The proposed algorithm computes the closed-form derivatives by representing the entries of a matrix in the cost function as polynomial functions of the pose parameters. Compared to traditional methods like Levenberg-Marquardt that use an approximation of the Hessian, the proposed Newton's method converges faster as it provides a better local approximation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It focuses on the plane adjustment (PA) problem in 3D reconstruction using depth sensors like RGB-D cameras and LiDARs. PA refers to jointly optimizing the estimated planes and sensor poses to minimize the overall point-to-plane distances, which is critical for accurate 3D reconstruction. 

- The PA problem is similar to the bundle adjustment (BA) problem in visual reconstruction, where 3D points and camera poses are jointly optimized. However, a key difference is that in PA the optimal plane parameters can be expressed as functions of the poses based on a closed-form solution. 

- The paper aims to develop an efficient solution to the PA problem using Newton's method, which can converges faster than the commonly used Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The key challenge is how to efficiently compute the Hessian matrix and gradient for the cost function that depends only on poses.

- The main contribution is deriving closed-form solutions for the Hessian and gradient. By eliminating planes using their optimal closed-form solution, the number of variables is significantly reduced. The computational complexity is also independent of the number of points per plane.

- Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Newton's method converges much faster than the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, especially for larger noise levels in the initial poses. This verifies the benefits of the closed-form Hessian and gradient computation.

In summary, it aims to efficiently solve the plane adjustment problem in 3D reconstruction by exploiting the special structure of the problem to enable a fast Newton's method optimization. The key novelty is the efficient closed-form Hessian and gradient computation.

This paper proposes an efficient second-order optimization method for plane adjustment (PA), which is the problem of jointly optimizing planes and sensor poses to minimize the point-to-plane distance. The key idea is to take advantage of the property that the optimal planes can be determined in closed-form by the poses.
