# [Efficient Second-Order Plane Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we efficiently solve the plane adjustment (PA) problem using Newton's method, taking advantage of the fact that the optimal plane parameters are functions of the sensor poses?

The key points are:

- The PA problem involves jointly optimizing planes and sensor poses to minimize point-to-plane distance, similar to bundle adjustment (BA) which optimizes 3D points and camera poses. 

- Typically Gauss-Newton methods are used for BA and PA because computing the full Hessian for Newton's method is too expensive for large problems.

- However, in PA the optimal planes can be eliminated and expressed as functions of the poses. This significantly reduces the variables and allows Newton's method to be applied. 

- The main challenge is efficiently computing the Hessian and gradient for the reduced PA cost function. 

- This paper provides closed-form solutions to compute the Hessian and gradient, enabling efficient Newton's method for PA.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by eliminating planes and efficiently computing the Hessian/gradient, Newton's method can outperform Gauss-Newton for the PA problem. The paper aims to demonstrate this through deriving the mathematical solutions and evaluating empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient second-order plane adjustment algorithm using Newton's method. Specifically:

- It takes advantage of the property that the optimal planes can be eliminated and expressed as functions of only the sensor poses. This significantly reduces the number of variables. 

- It provides closed-form solutions to efficiently compute the Hessian matrix and gradient vector of the resulting cost function, which only depends on poses. Previous works could not efficiently compute these, limiting the use of Newton's method.

- By efficiently computing the Hessian matrix and ensuring optimal plane estimations, it is able to achieve faster convergence compared to common first-order methods like Levenberg-Marquardt.

So in summary, the key contribution is an efficient way to leverage the second-order Newton's method for plane adjustment by eliminating planes and deriving closed-form solutions for the required derivatives. This results in faster convergence than typical first-order approaches.
