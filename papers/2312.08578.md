# [A Picture is Worth More Than 77 Text Tokens: Evaluating CLIP-Style   Models on Dense Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08578)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the Densely Captioned Images (DCI) dataset, comprising 8,012 images with dense, mask-aligned descriptions averaging over 1,000 words per image. DCI contains highly detailed visual descriptions aligned to semantic image regions, enabling new benchmarks to evaluate vision-language models' fine-grained understanding. They create a summarized version fitting existing models' 77 token limit using LLMs, called sDCI. Leveraging sDCI, they propose novel subcrop-caption matching tasks requiring selecting appropriate sub-image regions for each description. Evaluating models on sDCI reveals no existing methods perform well on both standard and subcrop-caption tests concurrently. Fine-tuning on sDCI boosts performance over baseline CLIP more efficiently than far larger automatically-constructed datasets like DAC. By providing the first human-annotated dense image captioning dataset with precise text-region alignment, DCI facilitates developing and evaluating next-generation vision-language models for deeper visual understanding.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision-language datasets trade off between scale and quality. Even curated datasets have short, high-level captions not capturing rich visual details. 
- No dataset has highly aligned, dense image descriptions to train or evaluate deep image-text understanding.
- Evaluation benchmarks rely on synthetic negatives, are gameable by language priors, and don't translate to compositional reasoning tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Densely Captioned Images (DCI) dataset with 8K images. Each image has mask-aligned descriptions averaging over 1000 words capturing fine details.
- Summarize DCI captions to 77 tokens using LLMs to evaluate current VLMs. This is the summarized DCI (sDCI) dataset.
- Propose subcrop-caption matching task using sDCI requiring models to match captions to corresponding subcrops.
- Fine-tune and evaluate models on sDCI based benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- Release first human annotated dense image captioning dataset with 26x more descriptions per image than prior datasets.
- Provide new benchmark to evaluate fine-grained vision-language understanding using sDCI. No model performs well on this.  
- Show sDCI based fine-tuning improves over baseline on several benchmarks, more effectively than a dataset with 10x more loose web captions.
- Establish value of high quality, dense capture datasets for future visio-linguistic models.
