# [Weighted strategies to guide a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm   for multi-UAV mission planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18749)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of multi-UAV mission planning, which involves assigning tasks to a swarm of UAVs and coordinating their actions to complete the mission. This includes aspects like resource allocation, timing, risk management, etc. As the scale and complexity grows with more UAVs, tasks and ground control stations (GCSs), classical planning methods fail to handle it efficiently. Hence, the authors model it as a multi-objective constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with conflicting goals like cost, risk, makespan etc. and propose a solution based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a biased random weighted MOEA combined with a CSP solver to tackle the mission planning problem. The encoding represents mission variables like UAV-task allocation, flight profiles, sensor assignments etc. The CSP fitness checks feasibility of solutions before evaluating the multi-objective aspects. To address the huge search space and guide towards valid solutions faster, a weighted random generator is used for initialization and mutation. It biases UAV selections based on proximity to tasks, GCS assignments based on locations, and number of UAVs for multi-UAV tasks. Different weighting strategies like arithmetic, harmonic and geometric are analyzed.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the multi-UAV collaborative mission planning as a multi-objective CSP problem with 7 conflicting objectives to optimize
- A MOEA-CSP hybrid approach using biased weighted random strategies to narrow the search towards promising regions
- Analysis of 3 different weighting strategies for number of UAVs selection, UAV-task assignments and UAV-GCS allocation
- Experiments over 16 mission scenarios validate the improved convergence over previous methods, especially for complex cases
- Visual analysis of trade-off solutions using parallel coordinates and radial visualizations

The main novelty lies in guiding the random search using weighted heuristics derived from problem structure, leading to faster convergence. The concepts can be extended to other complex multi-agent planning scenarios with similar characteristics.
