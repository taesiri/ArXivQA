# [A Trainable Feature Extractor Module for Deep Neural Networks and   Scanpath Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Scanpath classification, which analyzes eye movement sequences, has applications in medicine, training systems, etc. However, efficiently encoding scanpaths for machine learning remains an open research question.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel trainable feature extraction module for deep neural networks that transforms a scanpath into a feature vector for classification. 
- The module is inspired by classical histogram-based approaches that compute distributions over scanpaths. 
- It checks a series of inter-sample angles and angle ranges in the forward pass. Based on these checks, histogram bins are increased.
- In the backward pass, the error gradient is propagated back to update the angle ranges. This allows the module to adapt to improve classification performance.

Main Contributions:
- A new trainable feature extraction layer for deep neural networks that works directly on gaze samples without predefined areas of interest.
- Integration of an angle and angle range approach into the backpropagation algorithm to enable joint training.
- Evaluations on multiple public datasets comparing the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches for scanpath classification.

The key idea is to reformulate an existing angle and angle range method as a module that can be trained via backpropagation along with a deep neural network classifier. This allows automatically learning scanpath features tailored for classification instead of using hand-crafted features. Evaluations demonstrate classification accuracy on par with or exceeding prior state-of-the-art methods.
