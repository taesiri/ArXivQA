# [Speaking in Wavelet Domain: A Simple and Efficient Approach to Speed up   Speech Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have shown impressive performance in speech synthesis and enhancement tasks. However, their long training times and high inference costs hinder practical deployment, especially for customizing voices or adapting models to specific scenarios.

- Existing methods focus on accelerating inference but often require complex modifications to the model architecture. There is a need for a simple, universal approach to accelerate both training and inference of DDPMs. 

Method:
- The key idea is to redirect the generative target of DDPMs to the wavelet domain, thereby compressing the speech signal for faster processing. 

- Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to decompose the speech signal into low-frequency (approximation) and high-frequency (detail) coefficients. These are concatenated and used as the target for diffusion models. 

- Since the input length is halved, computations are reduced by 50% without changing the model architecture. This accelerates both training and inference by ~2x.

- The method is evaluated on Diffwave (speech synthesis) and CDiffuSE (speech enhancement) models using different wavelet bases like Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets etc.

Contributions:
- The proposed approach doubles the training and inference speeds across tasks and models without any architectural modifications. It is simple, universal and achieves comparable or better performance than original DDPMs.

- Analysis of different wavelet bases provides insights into their effects - Coiflets prioritize clarity over timbre preservation, Daubechies offers stability, while CDF 5/3 excels at lossless compression.

- Two additional modules are introduced - a frequency enhancer that improves quality further, and a multi-level scheme for over 5x acceleration with slight quality trade-off.

- Instead of modifying models, this work accelerates DDPMs by signal processing and provides a new perspective for optimization via input manipulations.

In summary, a simple yet effective wavelet-based strategy to universally accelerate speech diffusion models, analyzed through different bases, tasks and enhancements. The principle of operating on the input signal itself charts an alternate route for model optimization.
