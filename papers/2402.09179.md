# [Rapid Adoption, Hidden Risks: The Dual Impact of Large Language Model   Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are being customized via natural language prompts to create personalized versions called GPTs. However, the security of using such third-party customized GPTs is a major concern. 

- Previous backdoor attacks on ML models involve manipulating the training process, which is resource-intensive for large models. This paper explores a new attack vector by manipulating prompts.

Methodology:
- The authors propose "instruction backdoor attacks" to inject backdoors via prompts when customizing LLMs, without needing access or fine-tuning of the backend LLM.

- Three levels of attacks are presented with increasing stealthiness - word-level (triggers are keywords), syntax-level (triggers are syntax patterns), and semantic-level (triggers are semantic concepts).

- The attacks embed malicious instructions in prompts to make the LLM output the attacker's desired label on inputs with triggers, while maintaining utility on clean inputs. 

Results:
- Experiments on 4 major LLMs and 5 text classification datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the attacks, with high attack success rates and negligible impact on utility.

- The attacks are effective even when concealed in lengthy prompts. More powerful LLMs are shown to be more susceptible. 

- A mitigation method based on inserting an "ignoring instruction" before each input had partial success in defending against the attacks.

Contributions:  
- First demonstration of security risks with customized GPTs created via prompts, highlighting the need for better safety reviews.

- Novel prompt-based backdoor attack methodology as an alternative to expensive model retraining attacks.

- Analysis of factors affecting attack performance. Demonstration of defenses.

Overall the paper makes a compelling case for potential vulnerabilities introduced during LLM customization through prompts, and provides both methods to exploit as well as mitigate such risks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes instruction backdoor attacks against applications integrated with untrusted customized large language models by embedding backdoors into prompts used for model creation, without requiring access or modifications to the models themselves.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes the first instruction backdoor attacks against applications integrated with untrusted customized large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs. The attacks embed backdoors into the custom LLMs by designing prompts with malicious instructions, causing the models to output the attacker's desired result when inputs contain predefined triggers. The attacks include word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level attacks with increasing levels of stealthiness. The paper conducts extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the attacks, and also proposes a potential defense method. The main contribution is highlighting the vulnerability and potential risks of using customized LLMs such as GPTs by presenting effective instruction backdoor attacks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Instruction backdoor attacks - The main threat introduced in the paper, which involves embedding backdoors into customized large language models (LLMs) by crafting prompts with malicious instructions.

- GPTs - Refers to customized versions of LLMs that can be created through natural language prompts without coding, such as those powered by GPT-3.5/4. The paper studies attacks against applications using such GPTs.

- Trigger - A predefined pattern (e.g. specific words, syntax, or semantics) that activates the backdoor and causes the model to output the attacker's desired result. 

- Word-level, syntax-level, semantic-level attacks - The three levels of backdoor attacks proposed in the paper, with increasing levels of stealthiness based on the type of trigger used.

- Chain of Thought (CoT) - A technique used in the semantic-level attacks to improve the model's ability to execute backdoor instructions that involve multiple steps. 

- Attack success rate (ASR) - A key metric used to evaluate the efficacy of the backdoor attacks, measuring the rate at which the model produces the attacker's expected output on triggered inputs.

- Defense - The paper proposes an "instruction-ignoring" defense method that involves inserting an instruction before each input to disregard any malicious instructions, showing its partial effectiveness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three levels of instruction backdoor attacks with increasing stealthiness - word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level. Can you explain in detail the key differences between these three attack types and how the triggers and backdoor instructions differ?

2. The Chain of Thought (CoT) method is utilized in the semantic-level attack to improve the attack performance. How does CoT work and why is it needed specifically for the semantic attack? Explain with an example.

3. The paper evaluates the attacks on multiple large language models including LLaMA2, Mistral, Mixtral and GPT-3.5. Can you analyze and compare the similarities and differences in attack results across these models? What factors may contribute to these differences?  

4. In the ablation studies, trigger length, position and number of clean/poisoned examples are analyzed. Summarize the key findings and discuss why you think some factors impact attack success rates more than others.

5. The paper explores defenses against the proposed backdoor attacks. Explain the intuition behind the instruction-ignoring defense method, how it works, and analyze its effectiveness based on the results. What are its limitations?

6. The attacks in this paper target customized language models built using solutions like GPTs. Explain what GPTs are, their creation process, and the threat scenario that enables these backdoor attacks. 

7. The proposed attacks do not directly modify or fine-tune the backend language models. Explain why this approach is chosen and its advantages over traditional backdoor attacks on neural networks.

8. The paper mentions the attacks can be stealthy in practical implementation with long prompts. Elaborate why long prompts can help evade detection while retaining efficacy.

9. These attacks exploit the instruction-following capabilities of language models. Discuss the risks of enhanced instruction-following abilities in large language models, drawing parallels with the attacks. 

10. Analyze the real-world implications of such backdoor attacks if deployed against widely-used customized language models. What steps can language model providers and users take to defend against such threats?
