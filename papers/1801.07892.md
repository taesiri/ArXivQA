# [Generative Image Inpainting with Contextual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we improve image inpainting using deep learning to synthesize more realistic and coherent image content in missing regions, especially for challenging cases with large holes or complex structures?

The paper proposes a new deep generative network with a novel contextual attention module to address the limitations of previous CNN-based inpainting methods. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing a contextual attention module to explicitly attend on relevant background image features at distant locations and copy them to missing regions. This helps improve coherence.

- Introducing techniques like improved GAN loss, coarse-to-fine network, and spatially discounted reconstruction loss to enhance training stability and image quality.

- Demonstrating a unified feed-forward inpainting model that combines the contextual attention pathway and a separate pathway for hallucinating novel content.

- Evaluating the method on challenging datasets and showing it generates higher-quality inpainting results than previous state-of-the-art methods.

So in summary, the main research contribution is using attention and copying features from background to foreground in a learnable way along with other training improvements, to advance image inpainting quality and coherence for complex cases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel contextual attention layer to explicitly attend on related feature patches at distant spatial locations in a deep generative network for image inpainting.

- Introducing several techniques including inpainting network enhancements, global and local WGANs, and spatially discounted reconstruction loss to improve training stability and speed. This allows them to train the network much faster than prior work.

- Achieving high-quality inpainting results on challenging datasets including faces, textures and natural images using a unified feedforward generative network with the proposed contextual attention module.

In summary, the key contribution is the contextual attention layer and associated training techniques that enable efficient and effective borrowing of contextual information from background to fill in missing regions in images. The contextual attention allows matching and reconstructing missing patches using relevant patches from the surroundings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an improved generative image inpainting method using a novel contextual attention mechanism to explicitly utilize surrounding image features as references when generating missing image content.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research in generative image inpainting:

- The paper builds on prior work like Iizuka et al.'s globally and locally consistent image completion method. It reproduces and enhances their approach to create a stronger baseline model.

- A main novelty is the contextual attention module proposed to allow better borrowing of features from distant spatial locations. This is compared to other spatial attention methods like STN and appearance flow, and shown to be more effective for inpainting.

- The paper uses improved Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) loss instead of typical GANs like DCGAN. This is shown to help training stability and image quality compared to a DCGAN baseline.

- The two-stage coarse-to-fine architecture and other optimizations (like removing batch norm) are shown to dramatically speed up training convergence compared to prior work.

- Results are demonstrated on a range of complex image datasets - faces, textures, natural images - to benchmark the approach. Comparisons to other learning-based and traditional methods help situate performance.

- Ablation studies analyze the contribution of different components like the reconstruction loss, GAN choice, and attention modules. This provides insight into model design choices.

Overall, the paper makes several solid contributions in advancing deep learning based inpainting through architecture design, optimization, and benchmarking. The novel contextual attention mechanism is the biggest conceptual addition compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method to very high-resolution inpainting using ideas similar to progressive growing of GANs. The current method focuses on 256x256 resolution images, but the authors suggest adapting progressive growing techniques could allow it to scale to higher resolutions.

- Applying the inpainting framework and contextual attention module to other conditional image generation tasks like image-based rendering, image super-resolution, and guided editing. The authors suggest the core ideas could be useful for these related application areas.

- Improving the training stability and results for inpainting irregularly shaped holes, rather than just rectangular regions. The current method focuses on rectangular regions which may be less realistic.

- Exploring self-attention and nonlocal modeling in the network architecture as an alternative way to capture long-range dependencies in images. The contextual attention provides one way to do this, but self-attention is another approach.

- Speeding up the patch matching process in the contextual attention module, perhaps by learning an initial coarse correspondence map. The patch matching is a computational bottleneck.

- Validating the approach on a larger and more diverse dataset. The current experiments are somewhat limited in terms of dataset size and variety.

So in summary, the main directions seem to be 1) scaling up the approach to higher-resolution images, 2) applying it to related tasks beyond inpainting, 3) improving training for irregular holes, 4) exploring self-attention, 5) speeding up patch matching, and 6) more extensive validation. The core ideas seem promising for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved generative image inpainting framework with a novel contextual attention module. The model consists of two stages - a simple dilated convolutional network to make a coarse prediction, followed by a refinement network with the proposed contextual attention. The key idea is to use known surrounding image features as convolutional filters to help generate missing content. This allows explicitly matching and reconstructing using relevant semantic patches in the surroundings. The model also has a parallel convolutional pathway to hallucinate novel content as needed. The unified network is trained end-to-end with reconstruction loss and Wasserstein GAN critics. Experiments on faces, textures and natural images show the model generates higher quality inpainting results by leveraging surrounding image context compared to baseline and prior methods. The contextual attention visualization also reveals the model dynamically selects relevant features from the surroundings for reconstructing missing regions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an improved generative image inpainting framework with a novel contextual attention layer. The approach consists of two stages. The first stage uses a dilated convolutional network trained with reconstruction loss to generate a coarse estimation of the missing content. The second stage integrates a contextual attention module to explicitly borrow relevant features from surrounding image areas. The contextual attention module matches and attends on background patches to reconstruct missing patches in holes via convolution, softmax, and deconvolution operations. It also has a spatial propagation layer for coherency. The two-stage network is trained end-to-end with reconstruction losses and Wasserstein GAN losses for adversarial training.

Experiments demonstrate the proposed model generates higher quality inpainting results on faces, textures, and natural images compared to prior methods. The contextual attention allows better leveraging of surrounding image content. Comparisons to spatial transformer and appearance flow attention modules validate the advantages of the contextual attention design. Removing the reconstruction loss leads to poor results, showing its importance for content and GAN regularization. The two-stage coarse-to-fine structure enables faster convergence than prior work without compromising quality. The complete framework produces semantically consistent inpainting results on challenging datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an improved generative image inpainting method using a deep neural network with a novel contextual attention layer. The key ideas are:

- They develop a two-stage coarse-to-fine network architecture, where the first network predicts a coarse result and the second refines it. This enlarges the receptive field and stabilizes training. 

- They replace commonly used GAN losses with Wasserstein GAN loss, which measures a Wasserstein distance and is more suitable when combined with an L1 reconstruction loss. This improves training stability.

- They introduce a contextual attention layer that explicitly finds relevant background patches to borrow features from by using convolution and softmax operations. This helps generate more coherent contents. 

- The whole network is trained end-to-end with a discounted L1 reconstruction loss and global + local Wasserstein GAN losses. Experiments show the model generates higher quality inpainting results on faces, textures and natural images compared to prior arts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of image inpainting, which involves filling in missing or damaged regions in an image. Specifically, it focuses on improving deep learning methods for inpainting that can generate semantically plausible and visually realistic image content. 

Some of the key questions and issues the paper tackles are:

- How to improve deep convolutional networks for inpainting so they can better model long-range dependencies and copy patterns from distant image locations. Standard ConvNets have limited receptive fields.

- How to make deep inpainting networks train faster and more stably. The paper introduces several enhancements to improve training.

- Evaluating the proposed inpainting method on challenging datasets including faces, textures, and natural images.

So in summary, this paper is aiming to advance deep learning techniques for generative image inpainting, with a focus on improving contextual attention, training stability/speed, and performance on complex images. The core idea is using contextual attention to copy relevant features from background while also synthesizing new content.
