# [keqing: knowledge-based question answering is a nature chain-of-thought   mentor of LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate nonsensical or incorrect responses when faced with complex questions or problems beyond their knowledge scope. This is known as the "hallucination" phenomenon. 

- Existing retrieval-augmented LMs rely on embedding-based methods to retrieve relevant text passages from a corpus, which can bring in redundant or irrelevant information that negatively impacts the quality of LLM's response.

- Current LLM-based KBQA systems try to directly generate executable logical chains (in SQL form), but the generated SQL is often non-executable in practice. 

Proposed Solution - Keqing Framework:

- Decomposes a complex question into simpler sub-questions using predefined templates, making it easier for LLM to capture the logic (vs SQL chains)

- Aligns sub-questions to executable logical chains on a knowledge graph for retrieving answer candidates

- Reasons among candidates to select correct answers for each sub-question 

- Summarizes the workflow and outputs response with reasoning paths

Main Contributions:

- Proposes using logical chains on a knowledge graph as chain-of-thoughts to guide LLM to decompose questions, instead of hand-crafted methods

- Moves beyond text-to-SQL generation by using sub-question templates as intermediary to capture reasoning logic more easily

- Achieves competitive KBQA performance while also improving interpretability via the summarized response 

- Demonstrates knowledge-based QA can be an automated and scalable chain-of-thought mentor for existing LLMs

In summary, the Keqing framework improves reliability of LLM's response for complex KBQA by retrieving structured knowledge and chaining reasoning through sub-questions. The workflow serves as an interpretable chain-of-thought guide for the LLM.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Keqing that improves the reliability of large language models for knowledge-based question answering by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions, retrieving relevant knowledge triplets, reasoning over answer candidates, and generating explanatory responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Developing a new framework called Keqing to accomplish knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) tasks with large language models (LLMs). The workflow has four main stages: Question Decomposition, Knowledge Retrieval, Candidate Reasoning, and Response Generation. This aims to improve the reliability of LLM's responses.

2. Introducing question templates as an intermediary to make it easier for LLMs to capture the logic of question decomposition, where each template can be solved with several pre-collected logical chains. 

3. Utilizing the logical chains of KBQA as chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) to guide LLMs to decompose complex questions into sub-questions. This is automated and more scalable compared to manually constructing CoTs.

4. Experimental results showing that Keqing can achieve competitive performance on KBQA benchmarks while also illustrating the underlying logic to make the system more interpretable.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Keqing framework to incorporate knowledge retrieval and reasoning into LLMs to improve their performance and interpretability on KBQA tasks.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Knowledge-based question answering (KBQA)

The paper proposes a new framework called "Keqing" to accomplish KBQA tasks with LLMs. The key idea is to utilize the logical chains in KBQA as chain-of-thoughts to guide LLMs to decompose complex questions into simpler sub-questions, retrieve candidate answers, reason over them, and generate an interpretable response. The framework consists of four main stages - question decomposition, knowledge retrieval, candidate reasoning, and response generation. Overall, the paper demonstrates how KBQA can serve as an automated CoT mentor to improve the reliability and interpretability of LLMs for question answering.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using question templates as an intermediary to decompose complex questions into simpler sub-questions. How were these question templates designed and chosen? What were the criteria used?

2. The Knowledge Retrieval module retrieves candidate answers by aligning sub-questions to pre-collected logical chains. How were these logical chains constructed initially? What kind of reasoning do they represent? 

3. The paper claims logical chains can naturally form chain-of-thoughts to guide language models. Can you expand more on why logical chains lend themselves well to chain-of-thought prompting? What are the advantages over other approaches?

4. For the Question Decomposition module, what considerations were made in terms of dependency among the sub-questions? How does the system ensure correct flow of seed entities across dependent sub-questions?

5. Could you elaborate more on the two solutions mentioned to help language models understand the retrieved triplets? What were the tradeoffs and why was one method preferred over the other?

6. What constitutes the knowledge graph used in this work? What type of information does it encode and how was it constructed? What are its limitations?

7. The performance improves as more question templates are retrieved per sub-question. Is there a risk that excessive templates reduce reasoning accuracy? How can this tradeoff be balanced?  

8. How does the system handle failure cases where incorrect sub-questions are generated or incorrect answers retrieved after decomposition? Are there any fallback or recovery mechanisms?

9. For real-world deployment, how can the question templates, logical chains and knowledge graph be expanded to handle a wider range of complex questions? What efficiency challenges need to be tackled?

10. The paper focuses on knowledge questions, but can the framework be extended to other tasks requiring logical reasoning over multiple steps? What components would need to change?
