# [A pose and shear-based tactile robotic system for object tracking,   surface following and object pushing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prior tactile robotic systems have focused mainly on estimating contact poses between robots/sensors and objects. However, also estimating post-contact shear is important for tasks like object tracking, manipulation and pushing. Existing systems also rely on discrete, position-based control, limiting smooth continuous motions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a tactile robotic system that estimates both contact pose and post-contact shear from images of an optical tactile sensor. It uses a Gaussian Density Network (GDN) to predict pose and shear along with uncertainty estimates. These feed into an SE(3) discriminative Bayesian filter to reduce uncertainty over time. A feedforward-feedback controller then controls the robot's motion smoothly based on the pose and shear, enabling object tracking, surface following and pushing.

Key Contributions:
- Shows how to combine contact pose and shear into a unified "surface contact pose" for estimation and control
- Develops GDN model to estimate pose, shear and uncertainty from tactile images 
- Presents novel SE(3) Bayesian filter to reduce uncertainty using proprioceptive information  
- Achieves smooth continuous robot motion using velocity-based feedforward-feedback control
- Demonstrates capabilities including 3D object tracking, surface following, and single & dual-arm pushing
- Provides new perspective using Lie group theory for representing uncertainties and control

The proposed system is evaluated on various tactile manipulation tasks. Compared to a CNN baseline, the GDN model produces more accurate pose estimates, especially for shear components. The Bayesian filter further reduces errors and uncertainty. Overall, the system demonstrates useful capabilities like tracking moving objects, feeling surface shapes and robustly pushing objects. The use of velocity-based control and estimation of shear enables smooth continuous interactions.
