## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents work on Northeastern University's Husky Carbon, a bioinspired quadrupedal robot with aerial capabilities designed to achieve multi-modal locomotion. The robot takes inspiration from birds like the Chukar that use a combination of wing and leg forces (wing-assisted incline running or WAIR) to run up steep slopes. 

The paper discusses the challenges involved in achieving modalities like trotting-hovering and thruster-assisted incline walking for Husky Carbon. A key challenge is meeting the conflicting design requirements of an aerial vehicle (lightweight, low inertia) and legged robot (powerful actuators, rigid structures).  

A high-fidelity dynamic model of Husky Carbon was created in MATLAB SimScape and used to simulate a 45 degree incline walking gait. The model has 13 distributed masses and 18 degrees of freedom. A smooth ground contact model with stick-slip friction was used. The control strategy employed a collocation-based trajectory optimization to manipulate ground reaction forces and maintain friction cone constraints during incline walking.

In hardware, a "Husky Beta" platform was built using plastic and carbon fiber components to test control approaches at lower cost. Position control was implemented to achieve a simple trotting gait. In addition, a propulsion unit was fabricated and tested to evaluate the aerial capabilities. Experiments showed the robot trotting in place with thruster assistance.

The key contributions include: (1) hardware design and trotting control of the Husky Beta platform, (2) high-fidelity SimScape modeling and simulation of WAIR on steep slopes, (3) prototyping and testing of the propulsion unit, and (4) demonstrations of thruster-assisted trotting on the real robot. Overall, this work takes steps towards achieving robust multi-modal locomotion on the Husky Carbon platform.
