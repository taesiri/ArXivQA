# [LeggedWalking on Inclined Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents work on Northeastern University's Husky Carbon, a bioinspired quadrupedal robot with aerial capabilities designed to achieve multi-modal locomotion. The robot takes inspiration from birds like the Chukar that use a combination of wing and leg forces (wing-assisted incline running or WAIR) to run up steep slopes. 

The paper discusses the challenges involved in achieving modalities like trotting-hovering and thruster-assisted incline walking for Husky Carbon. A key challenge is meeting the conflicting design requirements of an aerial vehicle (lightweight, low inertia) and legged robot (powerful actuators, rigid structures).  

A high-fidelity dynamic model of Husky Carbon was created in MATLAB SimScape and used to simulate a 45 degree incline walking gait. The model has 13 distributed masses and 18 degrees of freedom. A smooth ground contact model with stick-slip friction was used. The control strategy employed a collocation-based trajectory optimization to manipulate ground reaction forces and maintain friction cone constraints during incline walking.

In hardware, a "Husky Beta" platform was built using plastic and carbon fiber components to test control approaches at lower cost. Position control was implemented to achieve a simple trotting gait. In addition, a propulsion unit was fabricated and tested to evaluate the aerial capabilities. Experiments showed the robot trotting in place with thruster assistance.

The key contributions include: (1) hardware design and trotting control of the Husky Beta platform, (2) high-fidelity SimScape modeling and simulation of WAIR on steep slopes, (3) prototyping and testing of the propulsion unit, and (4) demonstrations of thruster-assisted trotting on the real robot. Overall, this work takes steps towards achieving robust multi-modal locomotion on the Husky Carbon platform.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper outlines the mechanical and electrical design of Northeastern's Husky Carbon platform, a legged-aerial robot inspired by birds, presents simulation results demonstrating the robot's ability to walk up steep 45-degree slopes using wing-assisted incline running maneuvers, and discusses progress and remaining challenges in achieving multi-modal trotting-hovering locomotion on the robot.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the conclusion chapter, the main contributions of this MS thesis center around taking steps towards successful multi-modal demonstrations using Northeastern's legged-aerial robot, Husky Carbon. Specifically, the thesis discusses the challenges involved in achieving multi-modal locomotion such as trotting-hovering and thruster-assisted incline walking, and reports progress made towards overcoming these challenges. The work is inspired by animals like Chukar birds that use a combination of legged and aerial mobility (as seen in wing-assisted incline running or WAIR) to achieve locomotion over steep slopes and terrain. The thesis outlines the mechanical and electrical details of Husky's legged and aerial units, and presents simulated incline walking using a high-fidelity model of Husky Carbon over steep slopes up to 45 degrees, taking inspiration from the WAIR maneuver of birds.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a collocation-based approach to optimize the legged robot's motion during wing-assisted incline running (WAIR). How does this approach balance tracking performance and control effort through the cost function formulation? What are the trade-offs?

2. The paper models the legged robot dynamics using a reduced-order model (HROM) with massless legs. What assumptions does this make and what impact could that have on the accuracy of the model? How might you improve the model fidelity while retaining computational tractability? 

3. The paper uses an explicit Euler scheme to discretize the continuous HROM model. What are some limitations of this approach compared to an implicit integration scheme? When might an implicit scheme be preferred?

4. The paper uses cubic interpolation between discrete states to approximate the robot dynamics. What are some pros and cons of this approach compared to linear interpolation? When might higher order interpolation be beneficial?

5. How does the method choose the number and placement of collocation points during the trajectory optimization? What impact does the number and location of points have on accuracy and computational cost? 

6. What constraints are placed on the optimization problem for WAIR? How do these constraints balance stability, feasibility, and performance? Are there other important constraints not considered?

7. How does the method handle mismatches between the reduced-order model used for trajectory optimization and the full dynamics simulated? What robustness does the method have?

8. The paper uses a smooth stick-slip friction model between the feet and terrain. How might more complex ground interaction models like granular media affect the WAIR strategy?

9. For the WAIR maneuver, how does coordination between leg forces and thruster forces emerge from the optimization framework? Is the strategy intuitive?

10. The method is demonstrated in simulation for WAIR. What practical challenges need to be overcome to achieve WAIR experimentally on the real robotic platform?
