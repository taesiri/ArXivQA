# [Can Small Language Models Help Large Language Models Reason Better?:   LM-Guided Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategies for large language models (LMs) can improve reasoning performance but have issues like generating low-quality, repetitive rationales. 
- Directly optimizing large LMs is difficult given computational constraints.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a novel LM-guided CoT framework that uses two LMs - a small LM for rationale generation and a large frozen LM for answer prediction.
- First, use knowledge distillation to transfer rationale generation ability from the large LM to the small LM. 
- Next, use reinforcement learning with custom rationale quality metrics to further refine the small LM's rationales.
- Finally, use the refined small LM rationales to guide the large LM to make better predictions.

Key Contributions:
- A new resource-efficient CoT strategy that decompose reasoning into rationale generation and answer prediction.
- Knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning methods to improve rationale quality.
- Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA extractive QA datasets show the approach enhances both rationale quality and QA accuracy over baselines.
- Analysis provides insights like: selecting highest quality rationales does not always improve QA performance.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective approach to overcoming CoT prompting challenges that uses a small LM to guide improvements in a large LM's reasoning, outperforming standard CoT and reducing computational needs. The ablation studies also reveal interesting trends about balancing rationale quality and overall QA performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called LM-guided Chain-of-Thought that uses a small language model to generate rationales guiding a large language model to reason better for question answering, outperforming standard prompting methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called "LM-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT)" that leverages two language models - a small LM for generating rationales and a large frozen LM for predicting answers based on those rationales. Specifically:

- They first use knowledge distillation to transfer the reasoning ability from the large LM to the small LM for rationale generation. 

- They then refine the rationale quality of the small LM using reinforcement learning with custom reward signals related to rationale quality aspects like relevance, coherence, etc.

- Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA extractive QA datasets show their proposed approach outperforms standard prompting and original CoT prompting baselines in terms of answer prediction accuracy.

So in summary, the key contribution is demonstrating an effective and resource-efficient approach to improve chain-of-thought reasoning by using a small LM to generate high-quality rationales to guide a large frozen LM, without needing to directly optimize the large LM.

The paper introduces a novel framework called "LM-Guided Chain-of-Thought" that uses a small LM to generate rationales to guide a large frozen LM in reasoning tasks. Key aspects include distilling reasoning abilities from the large LM into the small LM using knowledge distillation, and further refining the small LM's rationales using RL with custom rationale quality measurements. Experiments are conducted on multi-hop extractive QA datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA. So the key terms cover the proposed methods, models used, and evaluation domains.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What motivated the authors to propose a separate small language model specifically for rationale generation instead of using the large language model directly? What are the key advantages of this approach?

2. The paper mentions using knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning to train the small rationale generation language model. Can you explain in more detail how these techniques were applied? What objectives or rewards were optimized?  

3. The paper introduces 8 different metrics to evaluate the quality of generated rationales along dimensions like relevance, coherence, fluency etc. Can you describe how these metrics were defined and measured, especially the automated versions used for reinforcement learning?

4. One interesting finding is that selecting the highest quality rationales did not always improve downstream task performance. What explanations are offered for this counterintuitive result? How might this be addressed in future work?  

5. How exactly were the FLAN-T5 models used in this work? What modifications or prompt engineering was done to adapt them for multi-hop question answering and chain-of-thought style prompting?

6. The method seems flexible enough to work with different model combinations. What other language models could be tried as the rationale generator or answer predictor? Would certain model architectures be more suitable?

7. The current evaluation is on extractive multi-hop QA datasets. What additional reasoning tasks could this method be applied to? Would any task-specific customization be needed?

8. The paper points out some limitations around model scale, task diversity, and amount of human annotation. How could these limitations be addressed in follow-up research? What scale of data collection or model pretraining would be needed?

9. One ethical consideration is that generated rationales may sometimes be non-factual or offensive. How might the approach be adapted to minimize these issues, especially if the rationales are intended for public release?  

10. How might the overall framework be extended to support an interactive setting? Could users provide feedback to iteratively improve rationale quality during model usage?
