# [Stay on topic with Classifier-Free Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17806)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems the central hypothesis of this paper is that Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), a technique originally proposed for improving text-to-image generation, can also be an effective method for improving prompt-adherence in language models. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that using CFG during inference will result in generations from language models that better align with the given prompt, across a variety of prompting approaches like basic prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, text-to-text generation, and chatbot prompts. They test this hypothesis through a series of experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, reasoning tasks, code generation, machine translation, and chatbot dialogue. The key research question appears to be whether CFG can reliably improve prompt-adherence and performance across these diverse language generation tasks compared to vanilla sampling.
