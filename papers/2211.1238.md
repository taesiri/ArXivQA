# [Late lumping of transformation-based feedback laws for boundary control   systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.1238)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, introduction, and conclusion sections of the paper, the central research questions appear to be:1. How can transformation-based feedback and observer designs (like backstepping and flatness-based designs) be approximated to obtain finite-dimensional controllers and observers that provide closed-loop stability when the original infinite-dimensional designs involve unbounded operators? 2. Under what conditions can convergence of the closed-loop system dynamics with the approximated controller/observer to the desired closed-loop dynamics be guaranteed?The key hypothesis seems to be that by decomposing the feedback/observer gains into bounded and unbounded parts, approximating only the bounded part, and assuming the unbounded part can be realized exactly, the spectrum of the closed-loop system with the approximation can be made to converge to the spectrum of the desired closed-loop system.Some key points:- The paper considers boundary control systems and systems with boundary observations, which lead to unbounded input/output operators.- Transformation-based designs like backstepping and flatness-based control aim to assign desired closed-loop dynamics but require approximation for implementation. - The gains are decomposed into bounded and unbounded parts. Only the bounded part is approximated.- Convergence of the spectrum of the approximate closed-loop system to the desired one is shown under certain spectral assumptions on the desired closed-loop system.- The assumptions are checked and the approximation schemes demonstrated for analytic and hyperbolic system examples.So in summary, the main research contribution is providing approximation schemes along with convergence guarantees for implementing infinite-dimensional transformation-based control designs on finite-dimensional systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing an approximation scheme for transformation-based feedback laws (such as backstepping and flatness-based designs) for infinite-dimensional systems with unbounded input operators. Specifically:- The feedback law is decomposed into an unbounded part that can be implemented exactly, and a bounded part that needs to be approximated. - An approximation scheme is proposed where only the bounded part of the feedback is approximated using a finite-dimensional subspace. The unbounded part is kept exact.- Spectral convergence results are provided showing that as the approximation order increases, the spectrum of the closed-loop system converges to the desired spectrum.- The results are applied to two important classes of systems - analytic (parabolic) systems and hyperbolic systems. Design guidelines and implementation details are provided for these cases.- An example of a hyperbolic system is worked out in detail to demonstrate the application of the controller and observer design and approximation techniques.So in summary, the key contribution is a systematic approximation scheme for infinite-dimensional feedback laws that provably retains stability, unlike standard finite-dimensional approximations. This helps make advanced controller designs tractable for implementation on real systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes approximation schemes for feedback laws and observer gains in infinite-dimensional linear systems with unbounded input/output operators, and shows spectral convergence of the closed-loop system operator to a desired operator under certain assumptions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on late-lumping feedback design for infinite-dimensional systems:- The paper provides convergence results for approximated feedback and observer gains based on a decomposition into bounded and unbounded parts. This extends previous work like Auriol et al. (2019) which looked at stability for particular backstepping designs. The results here are more general and apply to different transformation-based design techniques.- Compared to Rebarber (1989) which gave a spillover result for modal approximation of a beam controller, this paper considers more general abstract systems and proves convergence of the full closed-loop spectrum. - The assumptions made, like the desired closed-loop system being Riesz-spectral, are fairly typical for this area. The work shows these assumptions are satisfied for common system classes like analytic and hyperbolic systems.- For hyperbolic systems, the paper leverages existing canonical form results to systematically design stabilizing dynamics and approximation schemes. This aligns with the control canonical form work of Russell (1991) and others.- The observer gain approximation connects conceptually to finite-dimensional observer designs from Deutscher (2013), Gruene & Meurer (2022) but is formulated more generally. Approximation of both feedback and observer is considered.- Compared to early lumping methods, the late-lumping approach here approximates the controller/observer after design on the infinite-dimensional model. This helps maintain stability properties unlike ad-hoc finite-dimensional designs.Overall, the paper seems to advance the state of the art by providing fairly broad convergence results and demonstrating systematic application to important system classes. The connections to existing theory are clearly described throughout.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few future research directions based on the work presented in this paper:- Approximation of both the observer and the controller gains simultaneously for observer-based output feedback. The current work only considers approximation of the controller gain or the observer gain separately. Extending the results to approximation of both gains together is left open.- Convergence analysis when approximating both the observer and controller gains. While approximation results are provided for the controller and observer gains independently, analyzing convergence when approximating both gains in an observer-based output feedback configuration is an open problem. - Extension of the approximation methods to other system classes beyond analytic and hyperbolic systems considered here. The assumptions made in this work may apply to other important classes of infinite-dimensional systems, so exploring approximations in those settings is suggested.- Relaxation of technical assumptions if possible, such as the simple eigenvalue assumption, to broaden the applicability of the results.- Exploration of approximation methods besides the modal approximation approach used here. Other methods may provide advantages or complement the existing results.- Numerical studies and experimental validation of the approximation methods on physical systems.So in summary, the authors propose extending the theoretical convergence results to broader classes of systems and feedback configurations, relaxing assumptions where possible, and demonstrating the utility of the methods on real-world examples. The focus is on expanding applicability of the late-lumping approximation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents approximation schemes for state feedback and observer gains designed using transformation-based techniques like backstepping and flatness for infinite-dimensional linear systems with boundary control/observation. The gains are decomposed into bounded and unbounded parts. Only the bounded part is approximated while the unbounded part is assumed to be exactly realizable. Using operator theoretic techniques, convergence results are provided showing that the spectrum of the approximated closed-loop system converges to that of the desired closed-loop system. The results rely on spectral assumptions on the desired closed-loop operator. Analytic and hyperbolic systems are discussed as examples where these assumptions can be verified. An approximation method using modal decompositions is also presented for hyperbolic systems. Overall, the paper provides a rigorous analysis of approximating infinite-dimensional transformation-based feedback/observer designs while ensuring stability.
