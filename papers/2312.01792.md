# [Wild-Tab: A Benchmark For Out-Of-Distribution Generalization In Tabular   Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01792)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Wild-Tab, a new benchmark tailored for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization techniques in tabular regression tasks. The benchmark includes three large-scale industrial datasets from domains like weather forecasting and power usage estimation, providing a challenging testbed for assessing model robustness. Through comprehensive experiments with 10 different OOD methods, the paper reveals major gaps between in-distribution and OOD performance across all tasks, highlighting the difficulty of maintaining high performance on shifted data distributions. Interestingly, standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) proves very competitive, with more complex state-of-the-art OOD methods failing to significantly outperform it. The paper also studies the impact of model selection strategies, architecture choices, and hyperparameter tuning on OOD results. While advanced tabular models like MLP-PLR do not provide expected boosts, information bottleneck techniques display greater sensitivity to configuration details. Overall, the new benchmark facilitates further research into OOD generalization for tabular data, helping progress more reliable ML deployments. Key conclusions include substantial room for improvement in current techniques and the need for innovations to surpass basic ERM under data shifts.
