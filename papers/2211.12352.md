# [GlowGAN: Unsupervised Learning of HDR Images from LDR Images in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12352)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we learn to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) images from in-the-wild low dynamic range (LDR) images in a fully unsupervised manner?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a novel method called GlowGAN to learn to generate HDR images from unstructured LDR image collections without any supervision. 

- This gets rid of the reliance on paired HDR-LDR training data which is much harder to collect at scale.

- The key idea is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate HDR images which when projected to LDR with different exposures are indistinguishable from real LDR images. 

- The projection uses a camera model with stochastic exposure and camera response function. This acts as a "multi-exposure constraint" forcing the GAN to generate valid HDR images.

- Experiments show the method can synthesize realistic HDR images with higher dynamic range, enabling new applications like unsupervised inverse tone mapping and image-based lighting.

So in summary, the main research question is about unsupervised learning of HDR images from readily available LDR image collections, which is achieved via a novel GAN model with a differentiable camera projection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors propose a novel method called GlowGAN to learn a generative model of HDR images from in-the-wild LDR image collections in a fully unsupervised manner. This is the first work to demonstrate unsupervised learning of HDR images without relying on ground truth HDR data. 

2) The key idea is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) where the generator produces HDR images. These are projected to LDR via a camera model with random exposure and camera response function. This forces the generator to produce valid HDR images that look realistic under any exposure.

3) Experiments show that GlowGAN can synthesize high-quality and diverse HDR images with much higher dynamic range compared to vanilla GANs. It generates photorealistic results for challenging cases like lightning or windows where previous supervised methods fail.

4) GlowGAN enables new applications like unsupervised inverse tone mapping (ITM). Without using any HDR or multi-exposure training data, it reconstructs more plausible content for overexposed regions than state-of-the-art supervised methods trained on such data.

5) The generated HDR images can also be used as realistic and flexible environment maps for image-based lighting and rendered with smooth interpolation between maps.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel GlowGAN method for unsupervised learning of HDR images. This removes the reliance on scarce HDR training data and enables new applications in inverse tone mapping and rendering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised method called GlowGAN to learn a generative model of high dynamic range (HDR) images from collections of low dynamic range (LDR) images, and demonstrates its use for unsupervised inverse tone mapping to plausibly reconstruct missing information in overexposed image regions.
