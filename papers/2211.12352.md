# [GlowGAN: Unsupervised Learning of HDR Images from LDR Images in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12352)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we learn to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) images from in-the-wild low dynamic range (LDR) images in a fully unsupervised manner?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a novel method called GlowGAN to learn to generate HDR images from unstructured LDR image collections without any supervision. 

- This gets rid of the reliance on paired HDR-LDR training data which is much harder to collect at scale.

- The key idea is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate HDR images which when projected to LDR with different exposures are indistinguishable from real LDR images. 

- The projection uses a camera model with stochastic exposure and camera response function. This acts as a "multi-exposure constraint" forcing the GAN to generate valid HDR images.

- Experiments show the method can synthesize realistic HDR images with higher dynamic range, enabling new applications like unsupervised inverse tone mapping and image-based lighting.

So in summary, the main research question is about unsupervised learning of HDR images from readily available LDR image collections, which is achieved via a novel GAN model with a differentiable camera projection.
