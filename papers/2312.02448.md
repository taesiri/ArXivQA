# [Time-Relative RTK-GNSS: GNSS Loop Closure in Pose Graph Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02448)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pose-graph optimization technique for precise vehicle localization using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. The key idea is to use a new time-relative real-time kinematic GNSS (TR-RTK-GNSS) method to generate loop closure constraints in the pose graph, thereby reducing accumulated errors from GNSS Doppler velocity over time. Specifically, the technique leverages past GNSS measurements stored in the receiver to construct precise relative positioning baselines between non-sequential nodes. This allows closing loops in the pose graph within around 100 seconds without needing any additional sensors. Initial nodes in the graph are built up from GNSS Doppler velocities and connected via odometry-like edges. Global positioning is achieved through multi-GNSS pseudorange constraints. Experiments using a UAV with a low-cost single-frequency receiver demonstrated trajectory estimates with centimeter-level accuracy relative to ground truth, despite occasional carrier phase cycle slips. The proposed approach could enable precise, low-cost outdoor localization and mapping using only standalone GNSS receivers. Key limitations are the need for sufficient route loops within the TR-RTK-GNSS time difference limits.

- Real-time kinematic (RTK) GNSS can achieve centimeter-level accuracy but requires additional base station and communication infrastructure.
- Existing pose graph optimization techniques use other sensors like cameras, lasers, IMUs for loop closure to reduce accumulated error. But no technique uses GNSS for loop closure in pose graph optimization.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a novel pose graph optimization technique using a time-relative RTK-GNSS (TR-RTK-GNSS) method to generate loop closure constraints. 
- Leverages advances in pose graph optimization from robotics community for GNSS-based localization.
- Constructs pose graph with nodes as robot poses and edges as constraints between poses. Includes 3 constraints:
   1) Velocity constraints between successive nodes computed from Doppler velocities
   2) Pseudorange constraints for global position estimate 
   3) Novel TR-RTK-GNSS constraints for loop closure
- TR-RTK-GNSS uses time-differential carrier phase measurements from only a single GNSS receiver to compute relative position between non-successive nodes. Eliminates need for base station.
- Optimizes entire graph using least squares method to estimate accurate trajectory.

Main Contributions:
- First technique to use GNSS as loop closure constraints in pose graph optimization
- Novel graph-based localization using TR-RTK-GNSS constraints to achieve centimeter accuracy using only single stand-alone GNSS receiver, without base station or other sensors
- Formulates optimization framework for multi-GNSS constellations like GPS, GLONASS, Galileo etc.

In summary, the paper presents a new pose graph optimization framework that can effectively utilize GNSS measurements to achieve high accuracy localization without need for additional infrastructure. The proposed TR-RTK-GNSS constraints enable closing loops in the pose graph using only a single GNSS receiver.
