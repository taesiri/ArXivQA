# [Vision Language Model-based Caption Evaluation Method Leveraging Visual   Context Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating machine-generated image captions is critical as vision and language models progress. However, conventional metrics fail to discriminate caption quality beyond superficial word matches or embedding similarities. They still need improvement to compare more closely to human preferences.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents VisCE2, a new vision language model-based caption evaluation method leveraging visual context extraction. 
- It first extracts structured visual context from images, including objects, attributes and relationships. This helps the model better understand image content.  
- Then a vision-language model evaluates candidate captions based on the image, visual context and candidate caption. This enhances evaluation performance.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a new prompting method VisCE2 for VLM-based image caption evaluation using visual context
- Outperforms conventional metrics in capturing quality and consistency with human judgement
- Visual context helps model evaluate more accurately and comprehensively 
- Qualitative analysis shows VisCE2 identifies caption inaccuracies better than embedding-based metrics
- Experiments validate effectiveness on multiple datasets and VLMs. VisCE2 with smaller LLaVA model achieves performance comparable to GPT-4V

In summary, the key innovation is utilizing visual context to help VLMs better evaluate image caption quality, instead of just reference captions or embeddings. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate VisCE2's superior performance in assessing caption accuracy like humans.
