# [Are Language Models Puzzle Prodigies? Algorithmic Puzzles Unveil Serious   Challenges in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional visual question answering (VQA) datasets have focused on combining language and vision for tasks like object detection and spatial reasoning. They do not require complex algorithmic reasoning.
- Existing multimodal reasoning datasets rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge rather than core logical and mathematical reasoning skills.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces a new visual question answering dataset called \dataset{} that contains algorithmic puzzles spanning topics like combinatorics, graph theory, optimization etc.
- The puzzles are automatically generated from human-authored code and have unambiguous solutions. This allows the dataset to be scaled up in complexity.
- Each puzzle combines visual information (e.g. shapes, colors, positions), language descriptions and rules, and mathematical/algorithmic reasoning to derive the solution.

Key Contributions:
- Defines an ontology of visual (color, shape, position, text) and algorithmic (arithmetic, combinatorics, optimization etc.) features that make up the reasoning complexity of the puzzles.
- Creates a diverse set of 18 different puzzles with 100 instances each using combinations of these ontology features. In total 1800 puzzless.
- Puzzles are auto-generated from code allowing dynamic adjustment of reasoning complexity and removal of annotation noise.
- Experiments using models like GPT-4V and Gemini show very limited performance (near random for several puzzles), highlighting the challenges in combined visual, linguistic and algorithmic reasoning.

The core value of the proposed dataset lies in precisely formulating reasoning tasks that require the synergistic application of visual, linguistic and mathematical logic skills. Performance analysis based on the ontology provides insights into the specific reasoning deficiencies of language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new visual question answering dataset called AlgoPuzzleVQA, designed to test the capabilities of language models in solving algorithmic puzzles that require visual understanding, language understanding, and complex reasoning across mathematics, logic, optimization, and more.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing an ontology of multimodal reasoning features tailored for visual algorithmic puzzle solving, aimed at delineating the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). The ontology categorizes puzzles based on visual features like color, position, shape/size, text and algorithmic features like arithmetic, combinatorics, optimization etc.

2. Creating a novel puzzle dataset, AlgoPuzzleVQA, designed to test multimodal reasoning across vision, language and algorithms. The puzzles have unambiguous algorithmic solutions and require applying logic and mathematics adeptly in novel contexts without needing specialized domain knowledge. 

3. Proposing an automatic puzzle generation framework that allows dynamic adjustment of problem complexity and scalable dataset creation.

4. Experimental results with models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro etc. showing challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, revealing deficiencies in visual perception and algorithmic reasoning capabilities that hinder effective complex reasoning.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a novel visual algorithmic puzzle dataset AlgoPuzzleVQA along with an ontology of reasoning skills, to evaluate multimodal reasoning capabilities of language models. The paper also proposes an automatic framework for scalable dataset creation and benchmarking.
