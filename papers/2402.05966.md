# [Rethink Model Re-Basin and the Linear Mode Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Recent work has shown promise in "re-basing" independently trained neural networks into the same low-loss region (basin) by finding permutations to align the networks. This enables model averaging across basins. 
- However, current re-basing strategies have limited effectiveness in practice due to lack of comprehensive understanding. For example, very wide models are often needed, and commonly used matching algorithms still struggle to identify optimal permutations.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper revisits standard re-basing practices and finds that contemporary matching algorithms do not actually re-base models into the same basin. 
- It shows the key to success is: (1) Matching retains some knowledge in interpolated model (2) Re-normalization amplifies remaining information to restore performance.
- It proposes a new direct empirical analysis based on these two aspects to explain previous successes and failures. This perspective clarifies and improves current practices.

Key Contributions:
- Compares re-basing independent models vs models from same basin, revealing issues in contemporary matching algorithms.
- Shows success of techniques like RESET/REPAIR is mainly from rescaling activations to alleviate variance collapse, rather than full statistics correction.
- Links re-basing to pruning - a lightweight yet effective post-pruning method is developed that significantly boosts performance.
- Reveals large learning rate and weight decay create beneficial implicit regularization biases for re-basing.
- The proposed analysis effectively guides performance enhancements in model re-basing and averaging.
