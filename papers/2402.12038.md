# [Self-AMPLIFY: Improving Small Language Models with Self Post Hoc   Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown improved performance when provided with human-annotated rationales in the prompt using in-context learning (ICL). However, generating these rationales requires extra human effort or reliance on auxiliary models.  
- Small autoregressive LMs (SLMs) have emerged recently as more efficient but still highly performant alternatives to LLMs, making explanation methods more affordable to apply. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Self-AMPLIFY, an extension of the AMPLIFY framework, to automatically generate rationales to improve SLMs themselves using ICL. 
- It is the first approach that enriches prompts and improves SLMs without human annotations or auxiliary models.
- Rationales are generated by applying post-hoc explanation methods directly to the SLM predictions. Three types of explainers are used: attribution methods, self_topk token explanations, and self_exp natural language rationales.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a fully automated prompt-enriching framework for SLMs using self-generated rationales without external supervision. 
- Implements multiple rationale generation strategies - making it more flexible than prior work.
- Shows improved accuracy on commonsense reasoning and sarcasm detection over standard prompting and the Auto-CoT method.
- Sheds light on the potential of post-hoc methods for improving SLMs in a self-supervised manner.

In summary, Self-AMPLIFY can successfully leverage different post-hoc explanation techniques to automatically generate valuable rationales from SLMs themselves to enhance their own performance on reasoning-intensive NLP tasks. The approach is model-agnostic and demonstrates a novel way of extracting and re-using self-supervision signals.
