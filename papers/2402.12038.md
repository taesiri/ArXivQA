# [Self-AMPLIFY: Improving Small Language Models with Self Post Hoc   Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown improved performance when provided with human-annotated rationales in the prompt using in-context learning (ICL). However, generating these rationales requires extra human effort or reliance on auxiliary models.  
- Small autoregressive LMs (SLMs) have emerged recently as more efficient but still highly performant alternatives to LLMs, making explanation methods more affordable to apply. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Self-AMPLIFY, an extension of the AMPLIFY framework, to automatically generate rationales to improve SLMs themselves using ICL. 
- It is the first approach that enriches prompts and improves SLMs without human annotations or auxiliary models.
- Rationales are generated by applying post-hoc explanation methods directly to the SLM predictions. Three types of explainers are used: attribution methods, self_topk token explanations, and self_exp natural language rationales.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a fully automated prompt-enriching framework for SLMs using self-generated rationales without external supervision. 
- Implements multiple rationale generation strategies - making it more flexible than prior work.
- Shows improved accuracy on commonsense reasoning and sarcasm detection over standard prompting and the Auto-CoT method.
- Sheds light on the potential of post-hoc methods for improving SLMs in a self-supervised manner.

In summary, Self-AMPLIFY can successfully leverage different post-hoc explanation techniques to automatically generate valuable rationales from SLMs themselves to enhance their own performance on reasoning-intensive NLP tasks. The approach is model-agnostic and demonstrates a novel way of extracting and re-using self-supervision signals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Self-AMPLIFY, a method to automatically generate rationales from small language models using post hoc explanation methods to improve their performance in few-shot learning settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing \method, an extension of the \texttt{AMPLIFY} framework to build rationales from a small language model (SLM) to improve itself in in-context learning (ICL) settings. Specifically:

- \method is the first method to generate rationales to improve SLMs without using any auxiliary models or human annotations. It generates rationales directly from the SLM itself using post hoc explanation methods.

- \method implements 2 sample selection strategies and 4 types of post hoc explanation methods to generate rationales, making it versatile and flexible.

- Experimental results on two datasets and two SLMs show that \method leads to performance improvements over traditional prompting and the Auto-CoT method that also automatically generates rationales.

So in summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel approach (\method) to automatically generate rationales from SLMs to improve their own performance, without needing external models or human rationales. The method is shown to boost accuracy on reasoning tasks compared to other prompting strategies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Self-AMPLIFY - The proposed method to generate rationales from small language models (SLMs) to improve themselves
- In-context learning (ICL) - Learning from a few examples integrated into the prompt without fine tuning the model
- Small language models (SLMs) - Autoregressive language models with fewer than 14 billion parameters
- Post hoc explanations - Methods to explain a model's predictions, like attributions or self-rationales
- KernelSHAP - A perturbation-based attribution method implemented in Self-AMPLIFY
- DeepLift - A gradient-based attribution method implemented in Self-AMPLIFY  
- Rationales - Intermediate reasoning steps in natural language that justify a prediction
- Success vs error sample selection - Strategies to select samples for the prompt based on whether the SLM predicted correctly or not

The key focus is on using different types of post hoc explanations from the SLM itself to generate rationales, without needing any external or auxiliary models. The rationales are then used to improve the SLM's performance in an ICL setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Self-AMPLIFY differ from the original AMPLIFY method in terms of the models used for rationale generation? What are the main advantages of not relying on an auxiliary proxy model?

2. Why is Self-AMPLIFY well suited for small language models compared to large models? What computational advantages does it offer over methods that use attribution explainers like KernelSHAP or DeepLift on large models?

3. The paper mentions applying Self-AMPLIFY to even smaller models like TinyLlama. What challenges do you anticipate in generating good rationales from such small capacity models? How could the framework be adapted?

4. What are the relative merits of using a success versus error sample selection strategy? In what types of datasets or tasks do you expect one to outperform the other?

5. How suitable is Self-AMPLIFY for language models with limited reasoning capabilities? Would the rationales generated likely be less relevant or helpful in those cases?

6. Besides faithfulness, what other dimensions could be used to evaluate the quality of generated rationales by Self-AMPLIFY? How might ground truth rationales be obtained?  

7. The paper suggests comparing keywords in generated rationales to ground truth. What specific insights could this comparison provide about language models' ability to self-explain?

8. What are some ways counterfactual examples could be incorporated into Self-AMPLIFY's rationale generation? What benefits could they provide over existing methods?

9. How might Self-AMPLIFY rationales be combined with methods that identify and mitigate model biases during text generation? Could this make the framework safer?

10. What differences might be expected in rationale quality and utility when applying Self-AMPLIFY to language models trained on datasets of varying size, diversity and quality? How could the framework account for this?
