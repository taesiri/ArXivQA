# [Generalising Planning Environment Redesign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generalising Planning Environment Redesign":

Problem:
- Existing work on planning environment redesign focuses on modifying environments to facilitate goal/plan recognition tasks. However, an interested party may want to redesign environments for other objectives not related to recognition, e.g. constraining agent behavior for risk avoidance, ensuring privacy, enabling deception, etc.  
- Current approaches are metric-dependent, devising techniques tailored to specific metrics like worst-case distinctiveness. They don't generalize well across different metrics.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a general, metric-agnostic approach for environment redesign called GER. 
- Define novel metrics beyond just goal/plan recognition to enable other redesign objectives:
   - Goal/Plan Privacy: Maximise non-distinctiveness of goals/plans
   - Distance-based: Min/max avg/min/max distance from agent plans to target states
- Use anytime BFS search over action removal space, exploiting recent advances in top-quality planning for pruning.
- Can accommodate variety of metrics, optimize for multiple objectives, return set of diverse solutions.

Main Contributions:
- Argue interested party can have other redesign objectives beyond just recognizability. Propose novel metrics to enable this.
- Develop general, metric-agnostic approach GER that can optimize for different metrics by using top-quality planning and BFS search.
- Evaluation shows GER is orders of magnitude faster than prior work in goal recognition tasks. Also demonstrate effectiveness in finding solutions for novel metrics.
- Enable redesign for broader set of objectives; provide general, high-performing approach rather than sets of metric-dependent techniques.

In summary, the paper generalizes planning environment redesign to encompass more objectives, defines new metrics to support this, and provides an efficient, metric-agnostic approach that can optimize for different metrics. Key impact is enabling redesign for more applications and provably improving performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a general, metric-agnostic approach for planning environment redesign that can optimize various objectives beyond just goal and plan recognition, demonstrates its efficiency compared to prior methods, and introduces additional novel metrics related to preserving privacy, avoiding risk, and planning opportunistically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. The authors argue that the interested party in environment redesign may have objectives beyond just facilitating goal and plan recognition, such as privacy, risk avoidance, etc. They introduce several new metrics for environment redesign optimize these other objectives.

2. They propose a general, metric-agnostic approach called GERD for environment redesign that can optimize a variety of metrics. GERD uses an anytime breadth-first search algorithm and exploits recent advances in top-quality planning to efficiently compute plan libraries to guide and prune the search.

So in summary, the key contributions are (1) extending the formulation of environment redesign beyond just goal/plan recognition to other objectives, and (2) proposing a more general planning environment redesign approach that can optimize different metrics in a metric-agnostic way. Experiments show GERD outperforms prior methods in goal recognition tasks and can effectively optimize the new metrics introduced in the paper.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Environment design/redesign

- Breadth-first search

The paper focuses on the problem of planning environment redesign, where the objective is to modify an environment to facilitate or impede the recognition of an agent's goals and plans. It introduces new metrics beyond just goal and plan recognition, such as privacy, and presents a general metric-agnostic approach using top-quality planning and breadth-first search. The key terms reflect this focus on redesign, recognition, privacy, optimal planning, and search.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that existing environment redesign approaches make assumptions about the interested party's objectives being related to recognizing agents' goals or plans. What are some examples of other objectives the interested party could have that would motivate the need for a more general environment redesign approach?

2. The paper introduces several new environment redesign metrics such as Goal Privacy, Plan Privacy, Minimize/Maximize Average Distance, and Minimize/Maximize Minimum/Maximum Distance. For each of these new metrics, what are some potential real-world applications that optimizing for these metrics could be useful for?

3. The Approach section describes how the proposed method leverages recent advances in top-quality planning to compute plan libraries that are then used to prune the search space. Explain in detail how computing these plan libraries leads to a more efficient search process compared to prior environment redesign approaches. 

4. Theorem 1 states that under certain assumptions, the proposed approach is sound, complete, and optimal. Walk through the proof outlined in the paper and explain each component, as well as the role the stated assumptions play in ensuring the theoretical guarantees.

5. The experiments compare the proposed approach to a state-of-the-art Goal Recognition Design approach on optimizing worst-case distinctiveness. Analyze the results presented in Table 1 and discuss the factors that contribute to the proposed approach's superior performance.

6. Looking at the results in Figures 5-8, compare and contrast the relative difficulty the proposed approach faced in improving the transparency/privacy metrics versus the distance-based metrics. What properties of these metrics and planning environments likely account for these differences?

7. The related work section compares the proposed approach to prior methods along three dimensions: environment redesign objective, search algorithm, and handling of multiple solutions. Elaborate on the key differences along each dimension and their significance.

8. The conclusion mentions balancing time spent computing plan libraries versus searching the modification space. Explain this trade-off and discuss how heuristics could be developed to navigate it effectively. 

9. Beyond removing actions, discuss some other types of modifications to planning environments that could be interesting to allow within the problem definition in future work.

10. How could the proposed approach be extended to support optimizing for multiple environment redesign metrics simultaneously, rather than a single metric? What algorithmic changes would be required?
