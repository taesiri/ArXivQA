# [FuXi-S2S: An accurate machine learning model for global subseasonal   forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Subseasonal weather forecasting (2-6 weeks ahead) is crucial for disaster preparedness and agriculture planning, but remains challenging due to complex land-atmosphere interactions and lack of predictive signals beyond a month. Current physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have considerable biases and limited ensemble sizes constrained by computing resources. 

Solution:
The authors propose FuXi-S2S, an innovative machine learning model for global subseasonal forecasting of 16 variables up to 6 weeks ahead. The key components are:

1) An enhanced FuXi base model with a perturbation module that introduces flow-dependent, spatially-variable perturbations to hidden features for ensemble generation.

2) Incorporation of Perlin noise for additional perturbations to initial conditions. 

3) Training on 72 years of ERA5 reanalysis data at 1.5Â° resolution.

Main Contributions:

1) FuXi-S2S demonstrates superior predictive skill compared to the 51-member ECMWF ensemble, especially for precipitation extremes, in deterministic and probabilistic metrics.

2) It accurately predicts the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) up to 36 days, 6 days longer than ECMWF's 30 days. As the major source of subseasonal predictability, this is a pivotal advancement. 

3) For the 2022 Pakistan floods, FuXi-S2S predicted extreme rainfall with over 4 sigma accuracy 4 weeks in advance, greatly outperforming ECMWF. This shows real-world potential for early warnings.

4) This establishes machine learning as a competitive approach to global subseasonal forecasting, overcoming constraints faced by NWP models. Findings provide a foundation for predicting other modes of subseasonal variability.

In summary, through an innovative architecture and sufficient training data, the authors successfully demonstrate a machine learning model with comprehensive global subseasonal predictive capability surpassing state-of-the-art NWP ensembles. This represents a major leap towards actionable medium-range weather predictions for societal preparedness.
