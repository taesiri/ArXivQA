# [MOReGIn: Multi-Objective Recommendation at the Global and Individual   Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12593)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-objective recommender systems (MORSs) have emerged to provide recommendations that optimize for multiple goals beyond just accuracy, such as diversity, calibration, and fairness. 
- Existing MORSs operate either at the global/aggregate level to meet system-wide goals or at the individual/local level to meet user-specific goals. 
- No prior work has studied how to simultaneously achieve both global and individual goals within a single MORS.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new MORS approach called MOReGIn that jointly optimizes for both global and individual objectives.
- As a use case, it considers provider fairness (global goal) and calibrated recommendations (individual goal).
- It collects two new datasets with item genres and provider locations to enable studying this problem.
- The approach involves creating "buckets" to group items by genre and provider location. 
- These buckets are then used to post-process recommendation lists to balance provider fairness globally while calibrating recommendations to each user's individual preferences.

Contributions:
- Identifies limitation of existing MORSs in handling global and local objectives jointly.
- Provides new datasets with item genres and provider locations.
- Proposes MOReGIn algorithm to optimize for both provider fairness and calibrated recommendations.
- Shows MOReGIn outperforms baselines on both provider fairness and calibration metrics.
- Minimal loss of accuracy compared to non-fair approaches.
- Establishes that global and local beyond-accuracy perspectives can be jointly optimized in a single MORS.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed MOReGIn solution, and the main contributions made in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new multi-objective recommender system approach called MOReGIn that jointly optimizes for both global fairness towards item providers and local calibration of recommendations to individual users' preferences, demonstrating improved fairness and calibration over existing methods with minimal loss of recommendation accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Identifying the research gap that existing Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs) tackle either global or individual perspectives, but not both. The paper shows that when global and individual objectives co-exist, current MORSs are unable to meet both types of goals.

2) Presenting an approach that regulates the recommendation lists to guarantee both global and individual perspectives, while preserving recommendation effectiveness. Specifically, the paper tackles genre calibration as the individual perspective and provider fairness as the global perspective.

3) Validating the proposed approach by applying it to recommendations from five algorithms over two real-world datasets - an extended MovieLens-1M dataset and a newly collected song recommendation dataset. Both datasets are publicly released with the paper.

4) Showing through experiments that the proposed approach outperforms existing calibrated recommendation and provider fairness baselines in mitigating disparities and miscalibration, while achieving competitive recommendation accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is an approach to enable Multi-Objective Recommender Systems to account for both global and individual perspectives jointly, which has not been studied before. This is validated over two datasets released with the paper.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs)
- Calibration 
- Provider Fairness
- Global objectives
- Individual objectives
- Genre calibration
- Post-processing approach
- Bucketing strategy
- Movie recommendation
- Song recommendation

The paper presents an approach called MOReGIn that is a multi-objective recommender system aimed at providing both calibrated recommendations tailored to individual users' preferences as well as fair recommendations towards content providers, balancing both global and individual objectives. The approach utilizes a bucketing strategy to pair items by genre and geographic origin of providers in order to regulate the distribution of recommendations across users. Experiments are conducted in the domains of movie and song recommendation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the approach can be generalized to any global or individual objective. What other objectives beyond provider fairness and calibration could be interesting to explore? What challenges might emerge when considering different objectives?

2. The approach relies on creating buckets that pair item genres and continents. Could other attributes besides genres and continents be used for creating the buckets? How might the bucket creation process need to be adapted? 

3. The paper validates the approach on two datasets - movies and songs. What other domains could this approach be applied to? Would any significant modifications of the method be needed to generalize it?

4. The approach involves a 3-phase re-ranking process. Could additional phases help further improve the method's ability to balance global and individual goals? What criteria could be used to determine an optimal number of phases?

5. How robust is the method to variations in the relative importance placed on global vs individual goals? Could the method be extended to allow for tuning this balance?

6. The paper considers a post-processing approach. What are the potential pros and cons compared to integrating global and individual goals directly into the recommendation model training?

7. How does the computational complexity of the approach scale with the number of users, items, genres etc? Could optimizations help improve scalability?

8. The approach relies on having genre and geographic data available. How would performance degrade if this data was incomplete or noisy? Are there ways to make the method more robust?

9. The paper focuses specifically on movies and music. How well would the approach generalize to other fast-moving item domains like news or product recommendations?

10. The paper considers a static recommendation setting. Could the approach be extended to incorporate temporal dynamics in a sequential recommendation setting? What new challenges might emerge?
