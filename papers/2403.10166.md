# [SemanticHuman-HD: High-Resolution Semantic Disentangled 3D Human   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SemanticHuman-HD: High-Resolution Semantic Disentangled 3D Human Generation":

Problem:
- Existing methods for 3D-aware human image synthesis using neural radiance fields can control viewpoint and pose but cannot disentangle the generation of different semantic parts like body, tops, bottoms. 
- Current methods are limited to 512x512 image resolution due to high computational cost of neural radiance fields.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SemanticHuman-HD, the first method to achieve semantic disentanglement in 3D-aware human image synthesis.
- Use a two-stage training process:
  - Stage 1: Synthesize 256x256 images, depth maps, semantic masks, normal maps using $K$ independent generators for each semantic part.
  - Stage 2: Employ a novel 3D-aware super-resolution module that leverages depth and semantic guidance to reduce sampling cost and synthesize 1024x1024 images.

Main Contributions:
1) First method for semantic disentangled 3D-aware human image synthesis, with each semantic part generated independently. Enables garment generation, semantic editing.
2) First 1024x1024 resolution human image synthesis using a 3D-aware super-resolution module that preserves consistency.  
3) Superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Enables applications like virtual try-on, garment interpolation, out-of-domain image synthesis.

In summary, SemanticHuman-HD uniquely achieves semantic disentanglement at high resolution for 3D-aware human image synthesis, outperforming prior works substantially. The disentanglement and super-resolution capabilities open up new application possibilities.
