## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new self-supervised method for monocular scene flow estimation called EMR-MSF. Scene flow estimation involves understanding both 3D structure and motion from consecutive monocular images. The proposed method improves accuracy by borrowing effective network architecture designs from supervised learning methods and imposing geometric constraints using an ego-motion aggregation module. This module jointly infers ego-motion and per-pixel rigidity from the estimated motion field. A rigidity soft mask filters out dynamic regions to enable stable ego-motion estimation from static areas. The method also uses a motion consistency loss and mask regularization loss to exploit static regions. Further improvements come from training strategies like gradient detachment and enhanced view synthesis. 

Experiments demonstrate the proposed EMR-MSF method substantially outperforms prior self-supervised monocular scene flow techniques, improving the state-of-the-art SF-all metric by 44%. It also matches the performance of supervised methods. Across sub-tasks like monocular depth and visual odometry estimation, EMR-MSF shows superior performance compared to other self-supervised single-task or multi-task methods. The key innovations are the network architecture borrowing from supervised learning, explicit geometric constraints from the ego-motion aggregation module, and specialized losses to exploit static scene regions. This enables accurate and robust self-supervised monocular estimation of 3D structure and motion.
