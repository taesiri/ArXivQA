# [Do Large Language Models Rank Fairly? An Empirical Study on the Fairness   of LLMs as Rankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT and Llama2 are gaining popularity for text ranking tasks, demonstrating good performance. However, their fairness when used as rankers remains largely unexplored.  
- Prior work has shown biases in LLMs, but there is a gap in examining fairness of LLMs specifically as rankers in search systems.

Methodology:
- The authors conduct an empirical study evaluating LLM rankers on the TREC Fair Ranking datasets, using listwise and pairwise evaluation methods. 
- Listwise evaluation assesses model fairness and utility over full ranked lists. Pairwise compares ranking preferences between protected and non-protected groups.
- Models tested: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2-13b, Mistral-7b. Baselines: MonoT5, MonoBERT.
- Protected attributes: gender, geography. Neutral and sensitive queries are used.

Key Findings:
- Listwise results show neural rankers have higher precision but LLMs offer more consistent rankings. Both show biases toward certain queries, needing fairness enhancements.
- Pairwise evaluation reveals subtler unfairness in LLMs, with inconsistent treatment of protected groups.
- Fine-tuning Mistral-7b with LoRA balancing dataset mitigates bias, yielding improved fairness ratios.

Contributions:
- First benchmark investigating fairness of LLMs as rankers, using listwise and pairwise evaluations.
- Extensive experiments revealing fairness challenges when applying LLMs for ranking. 
- LoRA fine-tuning method to improve pairwise fairness ratios.

The paper provides an empirical analysis of fairness in LLM ranking models, using novel evaluation approaches. Key issues are highlighted and improvements demonstrated through fine-tuning strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper empirically evaluates the fairness of large language models as text rankers using listwise and pairwise methods, revealing biases that favor certain protected groups and proposing fine-tuning strategies to enhance fairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper presents the first benchmark results investigating the fairness issue in Large Language Models (LLMs) as text rankers. Specifically, it makes the following key contributions:

1) Builds the first LLM Fair Ranking benchmark incorporating both listwise and pairwise evaluation methods to assess fairness against binary protected attributes like gender and location. 

2) Conducts extensive experiments on real-world datasets to reveal the fairness challenges when applying LLM rankers. The analysis uncovers biases and inconsistencies in how these models treat protected groups.

3) Proposes a mitigation strategy to address the fairness issue observed in the pairwise evaluation. This involves fine-tuning an open-source LLM using LoRA to balance its treatment of protected and non-protected groups. The fine-tuned model shows improved fairness ratios closer to the ideal value of 1.0.

In summary, the paper presents an empirical analysis of fairness in LLMs as rankers, reveals issues through benchmark evaluations, and provides an initial mitigation strategy to enhance fairness. It contributes the first dedicated study and benchmark focused specifically on assessing and improving the fairness of LLM ranking models.

The paper presents an empirical study evaluating the fairness of large language models when used as text rankers. It focuses on ranking biases related to protected attributes like gender and geography. The main methods used are listwise and pairwise evaluations on the TREC Fair Ranking datasets. Models examined include GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2-13b, and Mistral-7b. One of the key findings is that while listwise evaluation shows fairness, pairwise evaluation uncovers subtle biases in how these models rank items from protected versus non-protected groups. The paper also demonstrates fine-tuning Mistral-7b with LoRA to improve fairness by adapting attention weights. So in summary, the key terms cover fairness benchmarking, ranking, biases, models, methods, and bias mitigation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes both listwise and pairwise evaluations for measuring fairness of LLM rankers. What are the key differences between these two evaluation approaches and what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. The paper finds that listwise evaluations paint a picture of relative fairness while pairwise evaluations uncover subtler biases in LLM rankers. What might explain this discrepancy and why is it important to conduct both types of evaluations? 

3. The paper employs group exposure ratios and precision metrics for the listwise evaluation. What are some alternative listwise metrics that could be used and would they offer any comparative advantages or disadvantages?

4. For the pairwise evaluation, the paper uses the ratio of first-ranked items from protected versus unprotected groups. What are some other pairwise metrics that could be used and what further insights might they provide?

5. The authors fine-tune the Mistral-7b model using LoRA to enhance fairness. What are the key ideas behind LoRA and how does it operationally adjust model parameters to reduce bias? What are its limitations?

6. The paper freezes parameters other than attention weights when applying LoRA to simplify implementation. How might unfrozen parameters further improve or detrimentally impact efforts to enhance fairness? 

7. What types of queries or documents do you think would be most challenging for LLM rankers to handle fairly? What modifications or additional training could help address these cases?

8. The paper focuses on binary protected attributes like gender and geography. How would the evaluation framework need to be adapted to handle non-binary attributes like race or multidimensional combinations of attributes?

9. What steps need to be taken when creating the training and evaluation datasets to ensure high quality and to avoid introducing additional biases that could negatively impact the fairness assessment?

10. The paper demonstrates effectiveness on TREC dataset. What real-world datasets and use cases should be tested to further validate the robustness of the benchmark and generalizability of findings related to LLM ranker fairness?
