# [Prompt4Vis: Prompting Large Language Models with Example Mining and   Schema Filtering for Tabular Data Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating data visualization queries from natural language questions (text-to-vis) is an important task but challenging. Prior works using complex neural networks still fall short of expectations. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities, presenting new opportunities for text-to-vis. 

Proposed Solution - Prompt4Vis:
This paper proposes a novel framework called Prompt4Vis that leverages LLMs and in-context learning to enhance text-to-vis performance. Prompt4Vis has two key components:

1. Example Mining Module: Carefully selects effective examples to provide context and guide the LLM, considering influence, similarity and diversity of examples. An influence model is trained using contrastive learning.  

2. Schema Filtering Module: Simplifies database schema provided in the prompt to reduce irrelevant information. Prompts LLM to select necessary tables for the input question.

Together these components generate clearer and more effective prompts for the LLM to produce better text-to-vis mappings.

Main Contributions:

- First work introducing in-context learning for text-to-vis using LLMs 
- Propose Prompt4Vis framework with novel example mining and schema filtering components
- Experiments show 36-71% improvement over state-of-the-art on NvBench dataset
- Demonstrate effectiveness of designed components through ablation studies
- Show better cross-domain stability compared to prior neural network models

The paper presents a promising new direction for text-to-vis using in-context learning and carefully designed prompts. The substantial improvements over prior arts highlight the potential of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Prompt4Vis that leverages large language models and in-context learning to enhance the performance of generating data visualization from natural language questions, through an effective example mining module and a schema filtering module.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It is the first work to introduce large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning to generate data visualization queries from natural language questions for the text-to-vis task. This brings new insights to the text-to-vis field and shows the promise of this new paradigm.

2. It proposes a novel framework called Prompt4Vis for adapting LLMs for the text-to-vis task, with two key components: an example mining module to find truly effective demonstrations for in-context learning, and a schema filtering module to simplify the database schema. 

3. Extensive experiments show that Prompt4Vis brings around 36% and 71% relative improvements in overall accuracy on the dev and test sets of the NVBench dataset, compared to the previous state-of-the-art. It also shows better stability across different cross-domains.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and showing the effectiveness of in-context learning with LLMs for the text-to-vis task through the proposed Prompt4Vis framework. The two components in Prompt4Vis are also shown to be effective through ablation studies.
