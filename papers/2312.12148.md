# [Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods for Pretrained Language Models:   A Critical Review and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive review and taxonomy of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for pretrained language models (PLMs). As PLMs continue to grow in size, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) containing billions or trillions of parameters, full fine-tuning of these massive models on downstream tasks becomes prohibitively expensive. PEFT methods aim to reduce the computational and memory requirements of fine-tuning while maintaining comparable performance. 

The paper categorizes PEFT methods into five groups: (1) Additive fine-tuning, which introduces extra trainable parameters like adapters or soft prompts, (2) Partial fine-tuning, which freezes parts of the model and only fine-tunes a subset of parameters, (3) Reparameterized fine-tuning, which decomposes weight matrices into low-rank approximations, (4) Hybrid fine-tuning, which combines multiple PEFT techniques, and (5) Unified fine-tuning, which utilizes a single PEFT method with weight sharing or pruning.

The authors conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding, machine translation, and natural language generation tasks using models like RoBERTa, T5, and LLaMA. The results demonstrate that most PEFT methods can match or exceed the performance of full fine-tuning while using only a fraction of trainable parameters. Among the techniques, adapter-based, soft prompt-based, bias update, and low-rank decomposition methods are shown to be particularly effective. The authors also assess the memory efficiency of PEFT methods, with techniques like QLoRA reducing GPU memory usage by up to 76% compared to full fine-tuning.

In addition to the taxonomy and experimental analysis, the paper discusses applications of PEFT in areas like multi-task learning, cross-lingual transfer, backdoor attack defense, and outlines promising future research directions. These include developing more lightweight hybrid PEFT methods, LoRA-derived techniques, PEFT libraries, theoretical analysis into their working mechanisms, and expanding PEFT to computer vision and multimodal domains.

In summary, this paper provides a structured framework for understanding the landscape of PEFT methods for PLMs, offering insights into their effectiveness in improving parameter and memory efficiency as well as directions for continued progress in this rapidly evolving field. The comprehensive analysis serves as an invaluable reference for choosing and applying suitable PEFT techniques.
