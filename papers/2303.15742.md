# [System-status-aware Adaptive Network for Online Streaming Video   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15742)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to design an efficient deep neural network that can perform online video understanding tasks (e.g. action recognition, pose estimation) with low latency on devices with fluctuating computational resources. 

The key hypothesis is that an adaptive network that jointly considers both the input video stream and the real-time system status of the host device can maintain high accuracy with low delay, even when the available computational resources vary over time.

Specifically, the paper proposes a System-status-aware Adaptive Network (SAN) that has two main components:

1) A lightweight agent module that generates a dynamic policy for processing each frame based on the input video and the real-time system status. 

2) A dynamic main network module that can adjust its computation complexity (depth and input resolution) on-the-fly according to the policy from the agent.

By adapting the network computation based on both the data stream and system status, the hypothesis is that SAN can achieve reliable and timely performance under fluctuating resource constraints. The paper conducts experiments to validate this hypothesis.
