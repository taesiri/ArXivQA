# [System-status-aware Adaptive Network for Online Streaming Video   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15742)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to design an efficient deep neural network that can perform online video understanding tasks (e.g. action recognition, pose estimation) with low latency on devices with fluctuating computational resources. 

The key hypothesis is that an adaptive network that jointly considers both the input video stream and the real-time system status of the host device can maintain high accuracy with low delay, even when the available computational resources vary over time.

Specifically, the paper proposes a System-status-aware Adaptive Network (SAN) that has two main components:

1) A lightweight agent module that generates a dynamic policy for processing each frame based on the input video and the real-time system status. 

2) A dynamic main network module that can adjust its computation complexity (depth and input resolution) on-the-fly according to the policy from the agent.

By adapting the network computation based on both the data stream and system status, the hypothesis is that SAN can achieve reliable and timely performance under fluctuating resource constraints. The paper conducts experiments to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing SAN, a novel system-status-aware adaptive network for online video understanding tasks like action recognition and pose estimation. SAN has two main components: a) A dynamic main network that can flexibly adjust its computation complexity via dynamic depth and dynamic input resolution. b) A lightweight RL agent that controls the main network by generating policies based on both the input video stream and the real-time system status. This allows SAN to maintain high performance with low delay even when the available computational resources are fluctuating.  

2. Introducing MSA, a meta self-supervised adaptation method, that allows convenient deployment of the pre-trained SAN model onto new target devices with potentially different hardware configurations and profiles. MSA utilizes an auxiliary task of delay prediction and a meta-optimization procedure to enable quick adaptation on the new device with self-supervision, without requiring the original labeled dataset.

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of SAN on online action recognition using 50Salads dataset and online pose estimation using Sub-JHMDB dataset. The results show that SAN can achieve higher accuracy and lower delays compared to prior arts, even when the system load is fluctuating rapidly. The adaptation capability of MSA is also verified by deploying across different devices.

So in summary, the key novelty and contributions are in designing a system-status-aware dynamic network that can adapt on-the-fly for online video tasks, and proposing a method for convenient self-supervised adaptation across different hardware platforms. The improved performance is demonstrated on two popular online video understanding tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a system-status-aware adaptive network (SAN) with a dynamic main module and lightweight agent that adapts the model's computation based on both the input video stream and fluctuating system status, and also introduces a meta self-supervised adaptation method (MSA) to effectively adapt the model to new hardware platforms at deployment time without labeled data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other related work in adaptive networks and online video understanding:

- Most prior work in online video understanding focuses on designing efficient network architectures or dynamic networks that adapt to the input stream. However, they do not consider the system status or computational resources available. This paper is novel in proposing a system-status-aware adaptive network SAN that adapts its behavior based on both the input stream and the real-time system status. 

- The idea of using a lightweight agent to control the behavior of the main network is similar to some prior dynamic network papers. However, the key difference is that the agent in SAN considers system status information to make decisions, while most prior agents only look at the input stream.

- The proposed Meta Self-Supervised Adaptation (MSA) method for cross-platform deployment is also a novel contribution. Most prior dynamic network papers train and test on the same platform. MSA provides an effective way to adapt SAN to new unseen platforms in a self-supervised manner during deployment.

- For online video understanding tasks specifically, SAN achieves superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-art methods like RA, DDLSTM, AR-Net, DKD, etc. It maintains high accuracy while keeping the processing delay very low even under fluctuating system loads.

- The idea of using reinforcement learning to train an agent that controls network behavior has been explored before in other contexts. But the application to online video understanding and using system status as an input to the agent is new.

In summary, the key novelties are the system-status-aware design of the overall SAN framework, the way the agent is trained to leverage system status, and the proposed MSA technique for convenient deployment to new platforms. Together, these contributions enable SAN to achieve excellent performance for online video understanding under fluctuating system resources.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate other ways to design the dynamic main network architecture to provide more flexibility in computational complexity, such as adding more resolution and depth options, or exploring different backbone architectures.

- Explore other methods for the agent module, such as using different RL algorithms or network architectures. The current design is quite simple and could likely be improved.

- Evaluate the proposed methods on a wider range of online video understanding tasks beyond action recognition and pose estimation. The ideas could potentially generalize to other tasks as well.

- Conduct more analysis on the behavior and learned policies of the agent module to better understand its decision making process. This could provide insights for further improvements.

- Extend the methods to deal with other types of system fluctuations beyond just compute resources, such as changes in memory usage, storage access, etc. 

- Study how to reduce the amount of fine-tuning needed during deployment-time adaptation, and investigate fully adaptive methods that can work in a zero-shot manner without any fine-tuning on the target device.

- Validate the approach on actual robotic systems and investigate any domain gaps between simulated environments and real-world deployment.

Overall, the paper provides a good foundation and proof of concept, but there are many possible directions to take this research further, especially in terms of generalizing the ideas to more tasks, platforms, and types of system fluctuations. The adaptation process could also likely be improved to require less fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a System-status-aware Adaptive Network (SAN) and Meta Self-supervised Adaptation (MSA) method for online video understanding tasks like action recognition and pose estimation. The SAN model consists of a lightweight agent module and a dynamic main network module. The agent selects the input resolution and execution depth of the main network dynamically based on both the input video stream and the fluctuating system status, allowing SAN to balance accuracy and delay. MSA further allows convenient deployment of the pre-trained SAN model to new target devices via an auxiliary task of delay prediction and meta-optimization. Experiments show SAN outperforms prior methods by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with low delay even under rapidly changing system loads. MSA also effectively adapts the agent to unseen devices in a convenient self-supervised manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel System-status-aware Adaptive Network (SAN) for online video understanding tasks like action recognition and pose estimation. The proposed SAN model consists of two main components: a lightweight agent module and a dynamic main network module. The agent module controls the behavior of the main network module by generating frame-level policies indicating what input resolution and execution depth the main network should use. Importantly, the agent's policy generation takes into account both the input video stream information as well as the fluctuating system status information like CPU/GPU usage. This allows SAN to dynamically adjust the computation load of the main network based on real-time system conditions, enabling low processing delays. The main network module is designed to be flexible, allowing dynamic input resolutions and early exits. 

The paper also proposes a Meta Self-supervised Adaptation (MSA) method to conveniently adapt the pre-trained SAN model to new deployment devices, without needing the original training data. MSA leverages an auxiliary task of delay prediction to fine-tune the agent on the target device in a self-supervised manner. It also applies meta-optimization during training for better adaptation. Experiments on action recognition and pose estimation tasks demonstrate that SAN achieves state-of-the-art performance under fluctuating system loads. MSA also effectively adapts SAN to unseen devices. Overall, the proposed techniques provide an effective solution for online video understanding on systems with dynamic computational resources.
