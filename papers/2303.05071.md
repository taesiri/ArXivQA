# [MBPTrack: Improving 3D Point Cloud Tracking with Memory Networks and Box   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05071)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: How can we improve 3D single object tracking by better handling target appearance variation and differences in target size? 

The key ideas proposed in the paper to address this question are:

- Using a memory mechanism to propagate rich spatial and temporal contextual information from historical frames to handle appearance variation. 

- Designing a coarse-to-fine localization network called BPLocNet that leverages bounding box priors to deal with differences in target size.

Specifically, the paper proposes a new 3D single object tracking method called MBPTrack that incorporates these two main ideas. The memory mechanism allows exploiting both spatial and temporal context from past frames to handle cases like occlusion or target disappearance. The BPLocNet module formulates localization in a coarse-to-fine manner using box priors from the first frame to sample reference points that adaptively cover targets of different sizes.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that exploiting historical context via a memory mechanism and handling size differences through box prior-based localization will improve 3D single object tracking performance. The experiments in the paper aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a memory-based tracker called MBPTrack for 3D single object tracking (SOT). This is the first work to exploit both spatial and temporal contextual information in historical frames using a memory mechanism for 3D SOT.

2. It introduces a new localization network called BPLocNet that handles the challenge of tracking targets of different sizes. BPLocNet uses box priors to sample reference points that adaptively cover targets of varying sizes and performs coarse-to-fine localization.

3. Extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets show MBPTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while running at 50 FPS. It demonstrates superior performance compared to previous Siamese-based methods that only consider the latest frames.

4. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the memory mechanism, decoupling design, and box-prior sampling in the proposed method. Integrating BPLocNet into existing frameworks also leads to consistent performance gains.

In summary, the key contribution is a new memory-based tracking paradigm and localization network that handles major challenges in 3D SOT like appearance variation across frames and difference in target sizes. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on major datasets using these ideas.
