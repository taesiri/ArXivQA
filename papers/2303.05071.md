# [MBPTrack: Improving 3D Point Cloud Tracking with Memory Networks and Box   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05071)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: How can we improve 3D single object tracking by better handling target appearance variation and differences in target size? The key ideas proposed in the paper to address this question are:- Using a memory mechanism to propagate rich spatial and temporal contextual information from historical frames to handle appearance variation. - Designing a coarse-to-fine localization network called BPLocNet that leverages bounding box priors to deal with differences in target size.Specifically, the paper proposes a new 3D single object tracking method called MBPTrack that incorporates these two main ideas. The memory mechanism allows exploiting both spatial and temporal context from past frames to handle cases like occlusion or target disappearance. The BPLocNet module formulates localization in a coarse-to-fine manner using box priors from the first frame to sample reference points that adaptively cover targets of different sizes.In summary, the central hypothesis is that exploiting historical context via a memory mechanism and handling size differences through box prior-based localization will improve 3D single object tracking performance. The experiments in the paper aim to validate this hypothesis.
