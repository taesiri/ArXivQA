# [DiffVL: Scaling Up Soft Body Manipulation using Vision-Language Driven   Differentiable Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06408)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces DiffVL, a framework to scale up soft body manipulation tasks by integrating vision-language driven differentiable physics. DiffVL represents tasks as a sequence of 3D keyframe scenes connected by natural language instructions depicting the manipulation goals between scenes. To facilitate non-expert users with task collection, the authors develop GUI annotation tools to construct a dataset of 100 diverse, realistic soft body manipulation tasks inspired by online videos. They further propose a method that leverages large language models to translate instruction texts into machine-interpretable optimization objectives tailored for differentiable physics solvers. Experiments demonstrate that by decomposing long-horizon tasks into subgoal scenes and compiling language guidance into optimization programs, DiffVL enables the trajectory optimizer to effectively solve complex, multistage soft body manipulation tasks that pose significant challenges for prior baselines. Overall, DiffVL provides an end-to-end solution encompassing intuitive task specification, language-driven optimization translation, and efficient differentiable physics based solving to unlock more scalable and capable soft body manipulation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

DiffVL introduces a framework that enables non-expert users to annotate soft body manipulation tasks using key frame scenes and natural language, compiles the language into optimization objectives via large language models, and leverages differentiable physics to efficiently solve the long-horizon, multi-stage tasks.
