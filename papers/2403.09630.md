# [Generalized Predictive Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current autonomous driving models have limited generalization ability to diverse environments and nondeterministic futures. Video prediction can serve as a promising learning paradigm to improve generalization.  
- However, existing driving video datasets are small-scale and lack diversity. Video prediction models tailored for driving scenes are still under-explored.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct the largest driving video dataset named OpenDV-2K from YouTube and other datasets, containing over 2000 hours of videos with diverse conditions.
- Propose GenAD, a generalized video prediction model specialized for driving scenes. It transfers knowledge from an image diffusion model to the driving domain, and develops temporal reasoning blocks to handle complex dynamics.
- Demonstrate GenAD's strong generalization ability by zero-shot prediction on various unseen datasets. Extend GenAD for action-conditioned prediction and motion planning.

Main Contributions:
- OpenDV-2K, the largest public driving video dataset with over 2000 hours of footage and text descriptions, enabling scaled learning.
- GenAD, the first large-scale video prediction model tailored for driving, with novel designs for reasoning complex dynamics. 
- State-of-the-art performance on driving video prediction benchmarks and promising extensions to simulation and planning tasks.
- This work unveils the potential of learning driving knowledge from large-scale video prediction pre-training. The released dataset and model will benefit the community on exploring this new paradigm.
