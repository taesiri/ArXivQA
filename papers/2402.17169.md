# [Deep Umbra: A Generative Approach for Sunlight Access Computation in   Urban Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Deep Umbra: A Generative Approach for Sunlight Access Computation in Urban Spaces":

Problem:
- Rapid urban development leads to increased building heights and densities, impacting sunlight access and shadows in cities. Properly quantifying sunlight access is key to tackling urban challenges like heat islands and ensuring quality of life.  
- Previous approaches for shadow analysis are not scalable beyond a few cities/neighborhoods. There is a need for methods that enable fast, comprehensive analysis of shadows for many cities over long time periods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Deep Umbra", a novel framework to quantify sunlight access and shadows at a global scale. 
- It uses a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) that considers a city's physical form to compute high-resolution spatial data of accumulated sunlight access for different seasons.
- The GAN takes as input building height tiles from OpenStreetMap, tile latitude, and season. It generates accumulated shadow tiles trying to mimic ground truth.

Main Contributions:
- Fast computation of accumulated shadows with speedup of 6x over prior work, enabling large-scale analyses.
- Introduces "Global Shadow Dataset" with accumulated shadow data for 100+ cities across 6 continents to facilitate research.
- Evaluated on cities worldwide, shows low error and transferability to unseen cities. RMSE below 0.1 for 720 min accumulation.
- Case studies with urban experts demonstrate usefulness for analyzing parks and street networks. Uncovers trends related to land use and shadows.

The paper makes available both the model and dataset to assist domains like urban planning, public policy, architecture etc. interested in the impact of sunlight and shadows.
