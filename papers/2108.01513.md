# [SphereFace2: Binary Classification is All You Need for Deep Face   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01513)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis seems to be that a binary classification framework for training deep face recognition models can outperform the commonly used multi-class classification framework. Specifically, the authors identify some potential limitations of the standard multi-class classification approach:- There is a discrepancy between the multi-class training and the pairwise verification done during evaluation/testing. The training objective deviates from the underlying face recognition task.- The softmax normalization in multi-class classification introduces competition among classes, which may lead to overconfident predictions. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel binary classification framework called "SphereFace2" for training deep face recognition models. The key ideas are:- Construct binary classification tasks for each identity, with images of that identity as positives and other identities as negatives. This aligns training with the pairwise verification done during testing.- Avoid softmax normalization to prevent competition among classes. The binary classifiers can be trained independently to improve discriminativity. The central hypothesis is that by training models through binary classification tasks, SphereFace2 can better optimize for the end goal of face verification and outperform existing multi-class classification methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SphereFace2 framework compared to state-of-the-art face recognition models.In summary, the key hypothesis is that binary classification training is better aligned with face verification testing and can lead to improved performance compared to standard multi-class classification training. The paper proposes and evaluates the SphereFace2 framework to test this hypothesis.
