# [DiffuseRAW: End-to-End Generative RAW Image Processing for Low-Light   Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Imaging in extremely low-light conditions is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio caused by minimal photon capture. Traditional image processing pipelines and enhancement algorithms struggle to restore good quality images in such conditions. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a new generative camera image signal processor (ISP) based on fine-tuning a latent diffusion model on raw sensor data. The key ideas are:

1) Work directly on raw sensor data rather than already processed images to make full use of the captured information. 

2) Fine-tune a pre-trained latent diffusion model on pairs of low-light raw images and corresponding long-exposure reference images. This allows exploiting strong natural image priors learned by the diffusion model.

3) The fine-tuned diffusion model learns to perform the entire ISP pipeline including demosaicing, denoising, enhancement etc. in an end-to-end manner tailored for low-light raw images.

4) Unlike specialized ISP pipelines, the generative modeling approach produces plausible image reconstructions consistent with raw measurements.

5) The conditioning mechanism of diffusion models allows guiding enhancement using text prompts in the future.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first diffusion model based generative ISP for extreme low-light image enhancement that operates on raw sensor data

- Develops fine-tuning approach on latent diffusion models using low-light and long-exposure image pairs 

- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on See-in-Dark dataset, demonstrating effectiveness of generative pipeline

- Establishes strong performance of diffusion models on raw sensor data, paving way for more research in generative image processing approaches.

In summary, the paper presents a novel generative ISP approach using diffusion models that pushes state-of-the-art in extreme low-light image enhancement by working directly on raw sensor data.
