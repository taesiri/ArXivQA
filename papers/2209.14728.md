# [Dependent Bayesian Lenses: Categories of Bidirectional Markov Kernels   with Canonical Bayesian Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research contributions of this paper appear to be:- Proposing a modified definition of Bayesian inversion in a Markov category using the notion of support objects, which gives unique Bayesian inverses.- Developing the theory of support objects and Bayesian inversion with supports in a Markov category.- Defining dependent Bayesian lenses, where the backwards object depends on a choice of prior over the forwards object. This is motivated by considering families of support objects indexed by priors.- Constructing the category of dependent Bayesian lenses as a Grothendieck construction over an indexed category of families of supports. - Showing this category has a section mapping morphisms to their canonical Bayesian inverses between support objects.So in summary, the central focus seems to be on developing a framework of dependent Bayesian lenses that allows for canonical Bayesian inversion relative to arbitrary priors in a Markov category. The key ideas are using support objects to get uniqueness and indexing over priors to get well-defined inversion. The overall goal appears to be equipping Markov categories with additional structure for studying Bayesian inversion and stochastic maps in a lens-like fashion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:- Proposing a modified definition of a Bayesian inverse in a Markov category using the notion of a "support object". This allows Bayesian inverses between support objects to be unique, giving a canonical Bayesian inversion functor.- Defining "dependent Bayesian lenses", a generalization of Bayesian lenses where the backward object can depend on a choice of distribution over the forward object. This allows modeling systems with families of Bayesian inverses parameterized by the prior.- Constructing the category of dependent Bayesian lenses in terms of families of support objects, indexed by the priors they depend on. This provides motivation for the definition and the "dependent" terminology.- Showing that the category of dependent Bayesian charts (a stepping stone to the lenses) has an oplax monoidal section embedding the base Markov category. Similarly, dependent Bayesian lenses have a lax monoidal section for Bayesian inversion.- Giving examples of Markov categories with supports for all distributions.So in summary, the main contributions seem to be proposing modified categorical definitions to allow canonical Bayesian inversion functors and parameterization by priors, developing the theory connecting this to families of support objects, and showing how this all fits together categorically.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a definition of dependent Bayesian lenses, which are a generalization of Bayesian lenses that allow the backwards object to depend on a choice of prior over the forwards object; this provides a setting to model stochastic processes with canonical Bayesian inversion restricted to points supported by a given prior.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper focuses on generalizing the concept of lenses (bidirectional transformations) to stochastic/probabilistic settings. Most existing work on lenses has focused on deterministic transformations between data types. Extending lenses to the probabilistic setting is an interesting direction.- The paper takes a categorical approach to modeling probabilistic bidirectional transformations, using concepts like Markov categories and Bayesian inversion. Other related work has modeled probabilistic bidirectional programs more operationally. For example, some papers have proposed probabilistic bidirectional programming languages. The categorical approach here feels more foundational.- The core idea is extending Bayesian lenses, as defined in previous work by Smithe, to allow for dependencies between the forward and backward objects. This seems like a natural generalization that increases the expressiveness. - The paper leverages concepts like support objects, indexed categories, and the families fibration to motivate and define the extension to dependent Bayesian lenses. The connections drawn to dependent type theory are insightful.- Compared to related work on probabilistic bidirectional transformations, this paper stands out in its focus on finding canonical/natural notions of inversion in this setting. The uniqueness results for inverses between support objects are nice.- Overall, the categorical viewpoint and the goal of finding canonical inverses give this paper a somewhat different flavor from other related work. The connections made to concepts in applied category theory like dynamical systems also help distinguish it. The dependent Bayesian lenses proposed seem like a useful advancement of the theory in this area.
