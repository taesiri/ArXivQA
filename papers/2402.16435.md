# [Training Implicit Generative Models via an Invariant Statistical Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Training Implicit Generative Models via an Invariant Statistical Loss":

Problem:
- Implicit generative models like GANs can learn complex data distributions but suffer from issues like mode collapse and training instability.  
- Even for 1D distributions, GANs struggle to approximate relatively simple distributions.
- There is a need for more stable and effective methods to train implicit generative models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a discriminator-free method to train implicit generative models based on an "invariant statistical loss" (ISL).
- The key idea is that the rank statistics of iid samples follow a discrete uniform distribution. This property holds for any continuous distribution.
- So they construct a loss function based on verifying if simulated samples have rank statistics that follow a discrete uniform distribution.
- This loss is invariant to the true data distribution and avoids the unstable min-max game of GANs.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a rank-based loss function (ISL) to train implicit generative models without a discriminator.
- The ISL enables learning complex, multimodal 1D distributions that GANs struggle with.
- Extends the method to temporal processes by modeling conditional distributions and achieving strong forecasting performance.
- With simple MLP architectures, the method matches or exceeds GANs and state-of-the-art temporal models on multiple tasks. 
- Provides an effective way to train implicit generative models that mitigates mode collapse and stability issues faced by adversarial techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel discriminator-free, rank statistics based loss function to train implicit generative models. By construction, the loss is invariant to the true data distribution. Experiments demonstrate it can effectively model complex 1D and temporal distributions where GANs struggle.
