# [Implicit Neural Representation of Tileable Material Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Representing high-quality tileable/seamless textures is challenging. Traditional pixel-based texture representations have limitations for seamlessness, sampling, and interpolation. 
- Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a continuous representation for images, but it's unclear how to use them to represent seamless periodic textures.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose using sinusoidal INRs to represent periodic tileable textures. 
- Show that initializing the first layer with integer frequencies results in the entire network being periodic. This allows representing continuous periodic patterns.
- Introduce a regularization term based on the Poisson equation to make reconstructed patterns seamless across tile boundaries.
- Use multiresolution sinusoidal INRs to represent textures across scales.

Main Contributions:
- Proof that compositional structure of sinusoidal networks preserves periodicity when first layer has integer frequencies.
- Seamlessness regularization term for training periodic INRs.
- Integer frequency initialization scheme based on Fourier series.  
- Experiments showing high-quality reconstruction and seamlessness of texture patterns.
- Applications demonstrating versatility for texture mapping tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces a periodic INR framework to represent high-resolution, seamless, tileable textures in a continuous, memory-efficient and scalable way. The method is shown to be effective at capturing sharp details across scales and patterns in the data.
