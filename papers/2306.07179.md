# [Benchmarking Neural Network Training Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07179)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper seems to be: How can we construct rigorous, fair, and relevant benchmarks to systematically compare neural network training algorithms and measure improvements in training speed due to algorithmic advances?The authors argue that the deep learning community currently lacks good benchmarks and methodologies for empirically evaluating and comparing training algorithms. As a result, it is difficult to determine the state-of-the-art training algorithm or reliably identify improvements. To address this, the paper introduces a new time-to-result benchmark called the MLCommons AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. The goal of this benchmark is to evaluate the training speed of algorithms across multiple workloads on fixed hardware. The benchmark aims to produce convincing measurements, provide insights into the causes of measured improvements, and focus on conditions relevant to real-world practice.The key components of the benchmark include:- Precisely defining and measuring training speed based on time to reach target error rates.- Using a diverse set of workloads covering different data modalities and model architectures.- Accounting for sensitivity to workload details through fixed and randomized workloads. - Requiring explicit tuning of hyperparameters under a controlled protocol.- Producing an aggregated benchmark score across workloads to incentive generally useful algorithms.Through detailed experiments, the authors demonstrate the need for such a benchmark and highlight challenges in training algorithm comparisons. They also provide baseline results using popular algorithms like AdamW and NAdamW to showcase the feasibility of the benchmark and provide a provisional state-of-the-art.Overall, the central hypothesis is that the proposed benchmark methodology will enable more rigorous empirical comparisons of training algorithms and drive further progress in this area. The paper aims to highlight the need for and introduce an initial instantiation of such a benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating and comparing neural network training algorithms. The key contributions are:- It articulates the challenges and issues with existing approaches for empirically comparing training algorithms, such as the lack of standardized evaluation protocols.- It proposes a new time-to-result benchmark called AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms that measures how quickly algorithms can train models to reach a target performance level. The benchmark uses multiple workloads on fixed hardware and has a rigorous scoring system.- It defines a set of rules and APIs for making valid benchmark submissions that isolate improvements due to the training algorithm. Submissions can compete in external tuning or self-tuning categories.- It introduces the concept of randomized workloads, in addition to fixed workloads, to require methods to be robust and discourage excessive workload-specific tuning.- It implements a diverse set of image, text, speech, and graph neural network workloads in JAX and PyTorch, as well as infrastructure for reproducible experiments.- It provides extensive baseline results using popular optimizers like Adam, showing the feasibility of the benchmark and that differences between methods exist. The results also reveal the importance of hyperparameter tuning protocols.- It sets a provisional state-of-the-art benchmark score using NAdam.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and implementing a standardized benchmark for empirically evaluating and comparing training algorithms in a rigorous, reproducible way. This can help drive progress on more efficient neural network training methods.
