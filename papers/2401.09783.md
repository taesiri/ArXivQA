# [Leveraging Biases in Large Language Models: "bias-kNN'' for Effective   Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) show promise for zero-shot and few-shot learning but their performance can be hampered by inherent biases. These biases influence the models' discriminative abilities and output, skewing probability values for certain categories and disrupting conventional decision boundaries.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel methodology called "bias-kNN" that capitalizes on the biased outputs rather than minimizing or correcting them. 
- It uses the biased outputs as primary features for k-nearest neighbors (kNN), supplemented with gold labels. 
- During prediction, it retrieves the k most similar samples and determines the label through majority voting.

Main Contributions:
- Presents a new perspective of harnessing biases and transforming them into assets to improve model performance instead of the traditional view of biases as solely detrimental.
- Comprehensive evaluations spanning diverse text classification datasets and GPT-2 model variants show the adaptability and efficacy of bias-kNN.
- Bias-kNN outperforms in-context learning in few-shot scenarios and exhibits robustness across samples, templates and verbalizers.
- Highlights the potential of strategically leveraging biases in certain contexts instead of only confronting them.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative bias-kNN method that harnesses the directionality of biases in LM outputs to empower a kNN framework for enhanced text classification, outperforming in-context learning. Evaluations demonstrate its versatility across models, datasets, templates and verbalizers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel "bias-kNN" method that harnesses the inherent biases in large language model outputs as features for a k-nearest neighbor approach to improve text classification, rather than viewing biases only as a detriment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of a novel approach called "bias-kNN" that capitalizes on the biased outputs of large language models by using them as primary features for kNN, supplemented with gold labels. Rather than minimizing or correcting biases like traditional methods, this approach harnesses them.

2. Comprehensive evaluations spanning diverse domain text classification datasets and different GPT-2 model sizes to demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of the "bias-kNN" method. 

3. Showing that the "bias-kNN" approach consistently outperforms traditional in-context learning in few-shot scenarios and exhibits enhanced stability across varied labeled data samples. Also demonstrating its robustness across diverse templates and verbalizers, highlighting resilience and broad applicability.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a new way to leverage biases in language models to improve text classification through a "bias-kNN" approach, rather than viewing biases as only detrimental. The method is shown to be versatile, adaptable and robust across models, tasks and setups.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called "bias-kNN" that leverages the biases in large language model outputs as features for a kNN classifier. Can you explain in more detail how the biased outputs are transformed into features for the kNN model? 

2. The evaluation results show that bias-kNN outperforms raw in-context learning, especially for small numbers of demonstration samples. What factors contribute to the superior performance of bias-kNN compared to standard in-context learning?

3. The paper argues that biases can be transformed from shortcomings into assets that improve model performance. Do you think there are any risks or downsides associated with intentionally leveraging biases in this way?

4. How does the performance of bias-kNN change with different model sizes, numbers of nearest neighbors k, and distance metrics? What impact do these choices have?  

5. The results show that bias-kNN is robust across different templates and verbalizers. Why does bias-kNN exhibit this robustness compared to the baseline approaches?

6. Could the bias-kNN approach proposed here be combined with methods that aim to correct or minimize biases, such as contextual calibration? Would this further improve performance?

7. The evaluations only cover text classification tasks. Do you think the bias-kNN approach could be applied effectively to other NLP tasks like question answering or summarization?

8. For real-world application, how would you determine the optimal number of demonstration samples m to use with bias-kNN? Is there a way to set this automatically?

9. The paper argues that model biases manifest partly due to surface form competition. Does bias-kNN help mitigate negative effects from this surface form competition?  

10. The results show high variance in some cases - for example, smaller models occasionally outperform larger ones. What could be done to further stabilize the performance of bias-kNN?
