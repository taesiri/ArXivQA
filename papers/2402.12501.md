# [Your Vision-Language Model Itself Is a Strong Filter: Towards   High-Quality Instruction Tuning with Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12501)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Data selection is important for acquiring high-quality data to train instruction-following large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). 
- Existing data selection methods for LLMs rely on unreliable single scores or use downstream tasks for selection, which can cause overfitting. They are also not suitable for VLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new data selection method called "Self-Filter" that uses the VLM itself as a filter to select the most challenging and informative instructions.

- It operates in two stages:
   1) Train a scoring network together with the VLM that assigns weights to each instruction based on difficulty level. More difficult instructions get lower weights.
   2) Use the trained scoring network to select the most challenging instructions and add a penalty to similar instructions to encourage diversity.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel data selection method for VLMs that utilizes the model itself to filter data without needing extra evaluation tasks.
- Show that only around 15% of data is needed to surpass full data performance on LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 models.
- Outperform competitive baselines like random selection, error-based methods, prototypicality and Alpagasus.
- Demonstrate the importance of selecting the most difficult samples and imposing diversity penalties.
- Provide comprehensive experiments on multiple VLMs over diverse evaluation benchmarks to validate the method's effectiveness.

In summary, the key insight is that VLMs themselves can act as effective filters for data selection through a trained scoring network, without requiring external evaluation datasets or tasks. The most informative challenging instructions are sufficient for successful tuning.
