# [Learning Trajectory-Aware Transformer for Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04216)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we enable effective spatio-temporal learning in videos to improve video super-resolution? 

The key hypothesis is that modeling long-range temporal dependencies across frames in a video can help recover finer details and improve video super-resolution performance. However, existing methods are limited in their ability to aggregate useful information across long sequences. 

To address this, the paper proposes a novel trajectory-aware Transformer model called TTVSR that can effectively learn from long-range sequences for video super-resolution. The key ideas are:

1) Formulating video frames into trajectories of visual tokens and limiting self-attention to tokens along the same trajectories. This reduces computational cost and enables modeling long sequences. 

2) Proposing a location map to efficiently track and update token trajectories over time.

3) Using cross-scale feature tokenization to handle scale changes in long sequences.

In summary, the paper aims to improve video super-resolution by enabling effective modeling of long-range dependencies, which existing methods fail to fully capture. The proposed TTVSR model provides an efficient Transformer-based approach to achieve this goal.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel trajectory-aware Transformer model for video super-resolution that links relevant visual tokens along spatio-temporal trajectories to enable effective long-range modeling in videos while reducing computational costs compared to standard Transformer architectures.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research in the field of video super-resolution:

- This paper focuses on using Transformers for video super-resolution (VSR), which is a relatively new approach compared to previous VSR methods based mainly on convolutional neural networks. Only a couple recent papers have explored using attention mechanisms or Transformers for VSR before this work.

- The key novelty is the proposed "trajectory-aware Transformer" that models long-range temporal dependencies between frames. Previous VSR methods using Transformers still had limitations in capturing long-range contexts due to the computational complexity. 

- This trajectory modeling is enabled by formulating video frames into trajectories of visual tokens and performing self-attention within the trajectories. This is a unique approach not explored by other Transformer VSR methods.

- Most prior VSR methods focused on using a sliding window of adjacent frames as input (e.g. 5-7 frames). Recurrent approaches tried utilizing longer sequences but still had issues like vanishing gradients. This paper shows strong performance gains by operating on much longer sequences of up to 50 frames.

- Extensive experiments on standard VSR benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent convolutional and recurrent VSR methods, especially on datasets with longer videos. The gains are shown to come from the improved long-range temporal modeling.

- The method still has limitations like handling complex motions and longer training times. But overall, it advances the state-of-the-art in utilizing Transformer architectures and long-range context for VSR. The trajectory modeling and attention scheme are novel contributions.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of VSR performance by introducing an innovative trajectory-based Transformer design to effectively capture long-range dependencies in videos. The results and analyses demonstrate the advantages over other VSR approaches, especially for longer sequences.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Evaluating the proposed Trajectory-aware Transformer (TTVSR) in more low-level vision tasks beyond video super-resolution, such as video denoising, deblurring etc. The authors mention that TTVSR could potentially benefit other video enhancement tasks as well with proper explorations.

- Extending the trajectory-aware Transformer to high-level vision tasks. The authors propose using trajectories to model long-range dependencies in videos for low-level vision tasks like super-resolution. They suggest exploring ways to apply this idea to high-level video understanding tasks too.

- Overcoming limitations related to sequence length and computational efficiency. The authors mention that TTVSR performs better on longer sequences but also has higher training time. Improving training efficiency and capability on shorter sequences could help extend its applicability.

- Handling complex motions like rotation better. The authors show failure cases where trajectories are inaccurate for rotating motions, limiting TTVSR's performance. Enhancing the trajectory generation or attention modules to handle complex motions is noted as an area for improvement.

- Exploring adaptive feature storage mechanisms to reduce GPU memory usage. Storing features across long sequences consumes GPU memory in TTVSR. The authors suggest designing dynamic and selective feature retention mechanisms.

- Incorporating more spatial modeling along with temporal modeling. The authors note that TTVSR mainly focuses on temporal modeling via trajectories. Complementing it with spatial modeling could further improve performance.

In summary, the key suggestions are to extend TTVSR to more vision tasks, improve its efficiency and applicability, handle complex motions better, reduce memory overhead, and incorporate more spatial modeling. The trajectory-aware modeling itself provides a promising research direction for modeling videos.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Trajectory-aware Transformer for Video Super-Resolution (TTVSR). TTVSR formulates video frames into pre-aligned trajectories of visual tokens, and calculates self-attention only along these spatio-temporal trajectories rather than across all tokens like a vanilla vision Transformer. This significantly reduces computational cost and enables modeling long-range dependencies in videos. TTVSR also proposes a cross-scale feature tokenization module to handle scale changes in long videos. Experiments on four video super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with gains of up to 0.70dB PSNR over prior methods. The reduced complexity enables TTVSR to leverage information across entire long video sequences rather than just short clips of frames. Overall, the paper introduces an effective way to adapt Transformers to the video domain for the task of super-resolution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Trajectory-aware Transformer for Video Super-Resolution (TTVSR). The key insight is to formulate video frames into pre-aligned trajectories of visual tokens, and calculate self-attention only on relevant tokens located along the same spatio-temporal trajectory. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to standard vision Transformers, enabling modeling of long-range dependencies in videos. Specifically, video frames are embedded into query, key and value tokens. Relevant tokens are linked over time into trajectories depicting object motions. Attention is calculated between a query and keys/values along its trajectory. Cross-scale tokenization allows handling of scale changes in long videos. 

Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Quantitatively, TTVSR outperforms recent methods IconVSR and BasicVSR on REDS4 by 0.45dB and 0.70dB PSNR respectively. Qualitative results show TTVSR recovers finer details and textures by leveraging distant frames. The reduced complexity allows long-range modeling impractical with standard Transformers. Limitations include decreased gains on short videos, and inaccuracies when complex motions like rotation occur. Overall, TTVSR advances the state-of-the-art in video super-resolution through an efficient trajectory-based Transformer design enabling effective long-range spatio-temporal modeling.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Trajectory-aware Transformer for Video Super-Resolution (TTVSR). The key idea is to formulate video frames into pre-aligned trajectories of visual tokens, where tokens along the same trajectory depict motions of visual objects. This allows the Transformer to focus its attention on the most relevant tokens over long spatio-temporal ranges for a query token. 

Specifically, TTVSR maintains a set of location maps that keep track of token trajectories over time. The location maps are updated efficiently in parallel using a lightweight motion estimation network. For a query token, self-attention is calculated only along its trajectory, significantly reducing computational cost compared to standard Transformers. 

Additionally, a cross-scale feature tokenization module is proposed to handle scale changes in long videos. It extracts multi-scale features into uniform tokens to enhance representations.

Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. TTVSR outperforms recent methods IconVSR and BasicVSR by large margins of up to 0.7dB PSNR, showing the benefits of modeling long-range dependencies. TTVSR also has comparable model size and FLOPs to recurrent models like IconVSR.

In summary, this work is one of the first to effectively introduce Transformers to video super-resolution through trajectory-based attention modeling. The proposed techniques enable efficient long-range spatio-temporal learning in videos for this low-level vision task.
