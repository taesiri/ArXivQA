## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes CSCLog, a novel log anomaly detection method that models the implicit correlations between subsequences extracted from log sequences based on components. CSCLog first splits log sequences into subsequences corresponding to different components. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are then used to capture the sequential dependencies within each subsequence. To model the interactions between subsequences, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to learn the correlations between subsequences in an end-to-end manner. Graph convolutional networks further enable information propagation between correlated subsequences. Attention mechanisms aggregate the subsequence embeddings into a log sequence representation for final anomaly judgement. Extensive experiments on four log anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate that modeling subsequence correlations allows CSCLog to significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by 7.41% average Macro F1-Measure. The results showcase the benefits of not only capturing sequential dependencies but also subsequence interactions for more comprehensive log anomaly detection.
