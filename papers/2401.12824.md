# [MAPPING: Debiasing Graph Neural Networks for Fair Node Classification   with Limited Sensitive Information Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12824)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) inherit and amplify historical discrimination and social stereotypes, causing issues for high-stake applications like clinical diagnosis and financial crediting. 
- Existing methods have limitations:
    - Most focus on in-processing techniques rather than pre-processing.
    - Those using pre-processing rely on pairwise constraints which don't generalize to multiple sensitive attributes.
    - They focus on either fairness or privacy but not the interplay between the two.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MAPPING, a novel pre-processing framework for fair node classification in GNNs.

- MAPPING has two main modules:
    1. Feature debiasing: 
        - Pre-masks sensitive attributes and highly associated features.
        - Reweights remaining features using adversarial training and distance covariance constraints to reduce bias and limit sensitive attribute inference.
    
    2. Topology debiasing:
        - Does fair message passing with equal edge weights and distance covariance constraints. 
        - Post-prunes biased edges after weights are updated during message passing.
        
- Uses distance covariance for its benefits over pairwise constraints like covariance and mutual information. Allows handling multiple sensitive attributes.

- Combines debiasing with adversarial training to limit sensitive attribute inference, exploring the interplay between fairness and privacy.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes MAPPING, the first pre-processing framework to jointly debias features and topology of graphs for fair node classification. Limits inference of multiple sensitive attributes.

- Achieves better trade-off between utility and fairness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Also reduces sensitive attribute inference risks.

- Empirically demonstrates alignments between group fairness and attribute privacy in GNNs. Shows improving fairness can also improve privacy.

- Analysis provides theoretical and empirical motivation for simultaneously pursuing fairness and privacy in GNNs.

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations of prior work on fair graph learning by developing a flexible pre-processing approach that debiases features and topology for any GNN model while also limiting inference of multiple sensitive attributes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel model-agnostic debiasing framework called MAPPING that leverages distance covariance constraints and adversarial training to mitigate feature, topology, and message passing biases as well as sensitive attribute inference attacks in graph neural networks for fair node classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It proposes a novel debiasing framework called MAPPING for fair node classification, which confines sensitive attribute inferences from pre-debiased features and topologies. 

2. It evaluates MAPPING on three real-world datasets and compares it with vanilla GNNs and state-of-the-art debiasing models. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of MAPPING.

3. It discusses the alignments between fairness and privacy on GNNs, and illustrates MAPPING can achieve better trade-offs between utility and fairness while mitigating the privacy risks of attribute inference.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the MAPPING framework that can debias graph neural networks to achieve fairness with limited sensitive attribute leakage. The experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and ability to balance utility, fairness and privacy.

The paper proposes a new debiasing framework called MAPPING that aims to make graph neural networks fairer by reducing feature and topology biases, while also limiting sensitive attribute inference attacks. Key elements include using distance covariance to measure feature dependencies, adversarial training to mitigate privacy risks, and masking/pruning to remove biases. The goal is to achieve better trade-offs between utility and fairness for node classification, while preventing amplification of social biases and discrimination.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing the MAPPING framework? Why is it important to debias both node features and graph topology in a pre-processing stage?

2. Explain the two empirical studies conducted in Section 3 and what insights they provide about biases in GNNs. How do they motivate the design of MAPPING?

3. What is distance covariance ($dCov$) and why is it used as the fairness metric instead of covariance or mutual information? What are the key advantages of $dCov$?

4. Walk through the pre-masking strategy step-by-step. What is the intuition behind identifying and masking sensitive features in this way? How does it balance utility and fairness?

5. Explain the reweighting module. Why is adversarial debiasing combined with $dCov$ constraints? How do they work together? 

6. Walk through the fair message passing and post-pruning steps. Why are equal edge weights initialized and then updated during message passing? What role does the pruning threshold play?

7. What assumptions are made about the capabilities of adversaries in analyzing sensitive attribute inference attacks? Why are these assumptions practical?

8. How is the framework extended to handle multiple sensitive attributes? What changes are needed to support this?

9. Analyze the results of the ablation studies in Section 5.3. What do they demonstrate about the contribution of each module in MAPPING?

10. What open questions or limitations exist with the MAPPING framework? What directions for future work are identified in the paper?
