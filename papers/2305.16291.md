# [Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How can we develop an embodied agent that is capable of lifelong learning to continuously explore, acquire diverse skills, and make new discoveries in an open-ended environment like Minecraft without requiring human supervision?

The key hypothesis is that by combining three main components - an automatic curriculum for exploration, a skill library for complex behaviors, and an iterative prompting mechanism - it is possible to create the first LLM-powered lifelong learning agent called Voyager that can achieve the capabilities mentioned above in the open-ended world of Minecraft. 

In particular, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. The automatic curriculum generated by GPT-4 can provide a steady stream of self-driven goals that encourage systematic exploration and skill acquisition.

2. The skill library that stores executable code as skills enables complex behaviors to be developed in a reusable, interpretable and generalizable manner, which can compound Voyager's capabilities rapidly.

3. The iterative prompting mechanism that leverages execution feedback and self-verification can improve the reliability of code generation by GPT-4 for control.

Together, these components could allow Voyager to continually explore Minecraft, unlock its tech tree, traverse long distances, and solve unseen tasks - advancing the state-of-the-art for autonomous lifelong learning agents. The paper aims to demonstrate these capabilities experimentally.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that by combining an automatic curriculum, skill library and iterative prompting with access to a large language model like GPT-4, it is possible to create an embodied agent that can lifelong learn in an open-ended world like Minecraft without human intervention. The paper empirically evaluates this hypothesis through the proposed Voyager agent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces Voyager, which is the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft. Unlike prior work, Voyager can continuously explore the world, develop increasingly sophisticated skills, and make new discoveries without human intervention. 

2. Voyager consists of three key components that enable its capabilities:

- An automatic curriculum that provides a stream of diverse and suitable tasks for open-ended exploration. 

- A skill library that accumulates complex behaviors in the form of reusable, interpretable, and generalizable code. The skills can compound each other, which allows rapid capability growth.

- An iterative prompting mechanism with environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification that significantly improves the consistency of code generation for embodied control.

3. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate Voyager's strong in-context lifelong learning ability. It obtains 3.3x more unique items, unlocks key tech tree milestones up to 15.3x faster, and traverses 2.3x longer distances compared to baselines. 

4. Voyager is also shown to effectively utilize its accumulated skill library to solve new tasks in a different Minecraft world, while other methods struggle to generalize.

In summary, this is the first work to develop an LLM-powered lifelong learning agent that can explore open-ended environments and acquire diverse skills in a self-supervised manner. The iterative prompting approach and automatically constructed skill library are key innovations that enable its capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Voyager, the first LLM-powered lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that can continuously explore the world, develop increasingly complex skills, and make new discoveries without human intervention through the use of an automatic curriculum, a growing skill library, and an iterative prompting mechanism.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in embodied AI agents:

- Focus on lifelong learning: This paper introduces an agent called Voyager that is designed to be a lifelong learner, continually acquiring new skills and knowledge over time. Many prior works focus on training agents to solve individual tasks, but do not address how agents can accumulate and transfer knowledge over extended periods. Voyager aims to fill this gap.

- Use of a skill library: Voyager maintains an ever-growing library of reusable skills represented as executable code programs. This allows it to compound abilities rapidly by composing simpler skills into more complex ones. Other approaches like reinforcement learning tend to learn behaviors from scratch, which can be sample inefficient and prone to forgetting previously learned skills. The skill library acts as an external memory to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

- Automatic curriculum learning: Voyager relies on an automatic curriculum generated by GPT-4 to suggest suitable exploration objectives based on the agent's current progress. This curriculum unfolds in a bottom-up manner driven by curiosity. In contrast, prior open-ended exploration techniques either use a manually designed curriculum or random objectives. The automatic curriculum provides a natural learning progression.

- Interaction via prompting: Voyager queries the GPT-4 model to generate action plans and skills, instead of needing direct access to model parameters or gradients. It essentially interacts with GPT-4 in-context through iterative prompting. Most existing methods require explicitly training the model via RL, imitation learning, or fine-tuning. Voyager demonstrates strong emergent capabilities can be achieved without parameter tuning.

- Use of code as action space: Voyager uses executable code programs as its action space, rather than low-level motor commands. Code provides a natural representation for temporally extended and compositional behaviors. This is crucial for handling many long-horizon tasks. Prior agent techniques mainly output short primitive actions.

Overall, Voyager introduces several innovations tailored for lifelong learning in embodied agents. The skill library, automatic curriculum, and iterative prompting appear to be particularly useful mechanisms for open-ended exploration and acquiring diverse skills over time.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing techniques to overcome the limitations of the current approach, including reducing costs, inaccuracies, and hallucinations. The authors mention improving GPT models and novel techniques for finetuning open-source LLMs as ways to address these issues.

- Incorporating multimodal perception into the agent, such as vision systems, to allow the agent to process visual input and support more visually complex tasks. The authors gave an example of using human visual feedback to allow the agent to build more sophisticated 3D structures.

- Applying the approach to other domains beyond Minecraft, such as robotics and real-world autonomous agents. The authors suggest their methods could enable the development of powerful generalist agents in a variety of embodied tasks.

- Exploring ways to make the agent more sample-efficient and enable faster skill acquisition, such as by combining it with gradient-based reinforcement learning techniques.

- Developing benchmarks and rigorous testing methodologies to systematically evaluate lifelong learning agents across diverse metrics like skill composition, transfer learning, and continual learning.

- Studying social learning, theory of mind, and collaboration between multiple lifelong learning agents.

- Enabling the agent to set its own goals and propose new tasks through intrinsic motivation and curiosity, going beyond the automatic curriculum.

- Improving interpretability of the agent's behaviors through better explanations and transparency.

Overall, the authors position this work as a promising starting point for developing more capable and general lifelong learning agents that can continuously acquire, refine, and compose skills in an open-ended manner. But they acknowledge limitations that provide opportunities for future work to enhance the agents with multimodal perception, social learning, theory of mind, curiosity, and more rigorous testing.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces \voyager, the first LLM-powered lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that can continuously explore the world, develop skills, and make discoveries without human intervention. \voyager consists of three key components: an automatic curriculum for proposing suitable exploration objectives based on the agent's capabilities; a growing skill library for learning and retrieving complex behaviors over time; and an iterative prompting mechanism that leverages GPT-4 to generate executable code as actions. This code-based action space allows for temporally extended and compositional policies. Through executing the code, collecting environment feedback and errors, and self-verifying task success, \voyager is able to iteratively improve the programs until mastery. Empirically, \voyager demonstrates strong capabilities on Minecraft exploration, efficiently unlocking tech tree milestones and traversing long distances across diverse terrains. It significantly outperforms RL and other LLM baselines by obtaining more items and faster tech tree unlocks. \voyager also exhibits zero-shot generalization by solving unseen tasks efficiently using its accumulated skill library from lifelong learning.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Voyager, an embodied lifelong learning agent powered by large language models (LLMs) to explore Minecraft continuously without human intervention. Voyager consists of three key components: 1) An automatic curriculum that uses GPT-4 to propose a stream of open-ended tasks for maximizing exploration; 2) A skill library that stores successful action programs as reusable skills indexed by embedding vectors; 3) An iterative prompting mechanism that executes the generated code, incorporates environment feedback and errors into the prompt, and repeats refinement until a separate GPT-4 agent performs self-verification on whether the task is completed. Rather than using low-level actions, Voyager leverages code as a natural action space for temporally extended tasks. It queries the blackbox GPT-4 API through prompting and in-context learning without explicit model training. The automatic curriculum, expanding skill library, and iterative prompting approach enable Voyager to acquire diverse skills, traverse long distances, and unlock the Minecraft tech tree faster than prior methods. The learned skills also transfer to solve new tasks in novel worlds.
