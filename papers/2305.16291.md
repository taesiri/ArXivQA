# Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How can we develop an embodied agent that is capable of lifelong learning to continuously explore, acquire diverse skills, and make new discoveries in an open-ended environment like Minecraft without requiring human supervision?The key hypothesis is that by combining three main components - an automatic curriculum for exploration, a skill library for complex behaviors, and an iterative prompting mechanism - it is possible to create the first LLM-powered lifelong learning agent called Voyager that can achieve the capabilities mentioned above in the open-ended world of Minecraft. In particular, the paper hypothesizes that:1. The automatic curriculum generated by GPT-4 can provide a steady stream of self-driven goals that encourage systematic exploration and skill acquisition.2. The skill library that stores executable code as skills enables complex behaviors to be developed in a reusable, interpretable and generalizable manner, which can compound Voyager's capabilities rapidly.3. The iterative prompting mechanism that leverages execution feedback and self-verification can improve the reliability of code generation by GPT-4 for control.Together, these components could allow Voyager to continually explore Minecraft, unlock its tech tree, traverse long distances, and solve unseen tasks - advancing the state-of-the-art for autonomous lifelong learning agents. The paper aims to demonstrate these capabilities experimentally.In summary, the core hypothesis is that by combining an automatic curriculum, skill library and iterative prompting with access to a large language model like GPT-4, it is possible to create an embodied agent that can lifelong learn in an open-ended world like Minecraft without human intervention. The paper empirically evaluates this hypothesis through the proposed Voyager agent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces Voyager, which is the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft. Unlike prior work, Voyager can continuously explore the world, develop increasingly sophisticated skills, and make new discoveries without human intervention. 2. Voyager consists of three key components that enable its capabilities:- An automatic curriculum that provides a stream of diverse and suitable tasks for open-ended exploration. - A skill library that accumulates complex behaviors in the form of reusable, interpretable, and generalizable code. The skills can compound each other, which allows rapid capability growth.- An iterative prompting mechanism with environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification that significantly improves the consistency of code generation for embodied control.3. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate Voyager's strong in-context lifelong learning ability. It obtains 3.3x more unique items, unlocks key tech tree milestones up to 15.3x faster, and traverses 2.3x longer distances compared to baselines. 4. Voyager is also shown to effectively utilize its accumulated skill library to solve new tasks in a different Minecraft world, while other methods struggle to generalize.In summary, this is the first work to develop an LLM-powered lifelong learning agent that can explore open-ended environments and acquire diverse skills in a self-supervised manner. The iterative prompting approach and automatically constructed skill library are key innovations that enable its capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Voyager, the first LLM-powered lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that can continuously explore the world, develop increasingly complex skills, and make new discoveries without human intervention through the use of an automatic curriculum, a growing skill library, and an iterative prompting mechanism.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in embodied AI agents:- Focus on lifelong learning: This paper introduces an agent called Voyager that is designed to be a lifelong learner, continually acquiring new skills and knowledge over time. Many prior works focus on training agents to solve individual tasks, but do not address how agents can accumulate and transfer knowledge over extended periods. Voyager aims to fill this gap.- Use of a skill library: Voyager maintains an ever-growing library of reusable skills represented as executable code programs. This allows it to compound abilities rapidly by composing simpler skills into more complex ones. Other approaches like reinforcement learning tend to learn behaviors from scratch, which can be sample inefficient and prone to forgetting previously learned skills. The skill library acts as an external memory to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.- Automatic curriculum learning: Voyager relies on an automatic curriculum generated by GPT-4 to suggest suitable exploration objectives based on the agent's current progress. This curriculum unfolds in a bottom-up manner driven by curiosity. In contrast, prior open-ended exploration techniques either use a manually designed curriculum or random objectives. The automatic curriculum provides a natural learning progression.- Interaction via prompting: Voyager queries the GPT-4 model to generate action plans and skills, instead of needing direct access to model parameters or gradients. It essentially interacts with GPT-4 in-context through iterative prompting. Most existing methods require explicitly training the model via RL, imitation learning, or fine-tuning. Voyager demonstrates strong emergent capabilities can be achieved without parameter tuning.- Use of code as action space: Voyager uses executable code programs as its action space, rather than low-level motor commands. Code provides a natural representation for temporally extended and compositional behaviors. This is crucial for handling many long-horizon tasks. Prior agent techniques mainly output short primitive actions.Overall, Voyager introduces several innovations tailored for lifelong learning in embodied agents. The skill library, automatic curriculum, and iterative prompting appear to be particularly useful mechanisms for open-ended exploration and acquiring diverse skills over time.
