# [Towards Fair, Robust and Efficient Client Contribution Evaluation in   Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04409)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing contributions of clients is important in federated learning (FL) for client selection, compensation, and incentive mechanisms. However, it is challenging due to non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-iid) client data, leading to noisy or divergent updates. Malicious clients further amplify this challenge.

- Existing methods have limitations:
    - Shapley value methods require high computational effort and a validation dataset
    - Distance-based methods lack a solid ground truth for comparison and ignore defense strategies against attacks  

Proposed Solution - FRECA:
- Proposes a Fair, Robust and Efficient Client Assessment (FRECA) method 

- Employs a framework called FedTruth to estimate the global model's ground truth update by balancing contributions from all clients while mitigating impacts from malicious ones

- Quantifies each client's contribution based on their share in the gap distance between the estimated and actual ground truth

- Incorporates a Byzantine-resilient aggregation algorithm, making it robust against attacks

- Operates solely on local model updates, eliminating the need for a validation dataset

Main Contributions:
- Proposes FRECA for accurately and efficiently quantifying client contributions in a robust manner
- Incorporates defense mechanism against malicious clients into client assessment
- Is efficient as it operates solely on local model updates and requires no validation dataset
- Experimental results demonstrate FRECA can quantify contributions accurately and efficiently even in attack scenarios where baseline methods fail
