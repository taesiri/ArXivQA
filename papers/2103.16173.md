# [Contrastive Embedding for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16173)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we develop an effective framework for generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) that mitigates the bias problem towards seen classes and leverages both class-level and instance-level supervision?The key points are:- GZSL aims to recognize objects from both seen and unseen classes, when training data is only available for seen classes. However, existing methods exhibit bias towards seen classes. - The paper proposes a hybrid GZSL framework that combines an embedding model with a feature generation model. The goal is to map both real (seen) and synthetic (unseen) features into an embedding space more suitable for GZSL classification.- A novel contrastive embedding model is proposed that can leverage both class-wise supervision (as in traditional semantic embedding) as well as instance-wise supervision which is usually neglected. This allows exploiting inter-class relationships as well as intra-class similarities.- Experiments on 5 benchmarks show the proposed framework with contrastive embedding (CE-GZSL) achieves state-of-the-art or very competitive performance. Especially, it significantly outperforms prior arts on 3 datasets.In summary, the key hypothesis is that combining feature generation and contrastive embedding can overcome the limitations of prior GZSL methods and achieve improved performance by leveraging both class and instance level supervision. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a hybrid GZSL framework that integrates an embedding model with a feature generation model. The framework maps both real and synthetic visual samples into an embedding space where the final GZSL classification is performed. 2. It proposes a contrastive embedding model for the hybrid GZSL framework. The contrastive embedding can leverage both class-wise supervision and instance-wise supervision, while previous embedding models for ZSL only use class-wise supervision.3. It evaluates the proposed hybrid GZSL framework with contrastive embedding (CE-GZSL) on five benchmark datasets. The results show CE-GZSL achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to previous methods.In summary, the key innovation is the hybrid framework combining generation and embedding models, and using a novel contrastive embedding that exploits both class-wise and instance-wise supervision. This allows the framework to leverage the strengths of both generative and embedding approaches for improved GZSL performance.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a hybrid generalized zero-shot learning framework combining feature generation and contrastive embedding models, utilizing both instance-level and class-level supervision to map real and synthetic visual features into an embedding space for improved classification of seen and unseen classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL):- It proposes a hybrid GZSL framework that combines a feature generation model with an embedding model. Most prior work focused on either generative/synthesizing methods or embedding methods, but not a combination. - It introduces a contrastive embedding model for the hybrid framework, which utilizes both class-wise and instance-wise supervision. This is different from typical semantic embedding models in ZSL that rely only on class-wise supervision via a ranking loss.- The contrastive embedding leverages recent advances in contrastive representation learning. This allows it to enforce stronger discrimination between classes compared to standard semantic embedding losses.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on 3 out of 5 benchmark datasets, outperforming many recent GZSL methods. On the other two datasets it achieves very competitive second best results.- The improvement over prior work is particularly notable on the CUB dataset, where it is the first to surpass 60% on both Top-1 unseen class accuracy and harmonic mean.Overall, the key innovations are in proposing the hybrid framework that combines generation and embedding models, and using a contrastive embedding loss that exploits both instance-wise and class-wise supervision. This allows the model to learn more discriminative embeddings for GZSL. The strong experimental results validate these design choices and show the effectiveness of the approach compared to prior state-of-the-art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring more advanced generative models in the hybrid GZSL framework, beyond the simple generative model used in their current work. The authors mention that their hybrid framework achieves competitive results even with a simple generative model, so more advanced models like generative adversarial networks or normalizing flows could further improve performance.- Investigating different designs and objectives for the contrastive embedding model. The authors propose a basic contrastive embedding model in this work, but they suggest exploring other ways to leverage both instance-level and class-level supervisions. - Applying the hybrid framework and contrastive embedding model to other related problems beyond GZSL, such as few-shot learning. The authors suggest their ideas could be extended to other imbalanced learning scenarios.- Evaluating the approach on larger-scale and more complex datasets. The authors use several existing small-scale ZSL datasets in this work, but suggest testing on larger and more challenging datasets in the future.- Exploring how to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, as the contrastive embedding introduces some new hyperparameters. More efficient hyperparameter tuning could further optimize results.- Analyzing the theoretical properties of the contrastive embedding model and the hybrid framework, such as generalization guarantees. Providing formal theoretical analysis is posed as an important direction.In summary, the main future directions are improving the generative and embedding models used in the framework, applying the approach to new problems/datasets, more thorough hyperparameter tuning, and theoretical analysis. The hybrid framework and contrastive embedding seem promising, and the authors provide good suggestions for extending this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a hybrid generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) framework that combines a feature generation model with an embedding model. The feature generation model synthesizes missing visual features for unseen classes. Then both real seen features and synthetic unseen features are mapped to an embedding space using an embedding model. The embedding model employs a novel contrastive embedding approach rather than a traditional semantic embedding. The contrastive embedding can leverage both class-level and instance-level supervision, while semantic embedding only uses class-level. Experiments on 5 datasets show the proposed hybrid framework with contrastive embedding (CE-GZSL) achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results. The ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of the hybrid approach and contrastive embedding over alternatives. The key novelty is the combination of feature generation and contrastive embedding to effectively address the GZSL problem.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a hybrid generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) framework that integrates an embedding model with a feature generation model. The embedding model maps both real seen class samples and synthetic unseen class samples produced by the generation model into a common embedding space. The paper argues that the original visual feature space used by generation models is not optimal for GZSL classification, and that mapping samples to an embedding space can improve discrimination. Specifically, the paper proposes using a contrastive embedding model which exploits both class-wise supervision and instance-wise supervision. Class-wise supervision relies on class descriptors to embed samples close to their class centroid. Instance-wise supervision uses contrastive learning to discriminate each sample from other samples in the batch. The proposed hybrid GZSL framework with contrastive embedding (CE-GZSL) is evaluated on five benchmark datasets. The results show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets and competitive results on two others. Component analyses demonstrate the benefits of the hybrid framework over using either generation or embedding alone. Ablation studies illustrate the contribution of both class-wise and instance-wise supervision in the contrastive embedding model. The experiments also analyze the impact of different hyperparameters like embedding dimension, batch composition, and temperature scaling. Overall, the hybrid framework with contrastive embedding provides an effective approach for GZSL by integrating generation and discriminative embedding.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a hybrid generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) framework that combines a feature generation model with an embedding model. The feature generation model uses a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize visual features for unseen classes based on their semantic descriptors. The embedding model maps both the real seen features and synthetic unseen features into a new embedding space using a proposed contrastive embedding approach. The contrastive embedding exploits both class-wise supervision, by distinguishing between semantic descriptors, and instance-wise supervision, by distinguishing between individual samples. The contrastive embedding contains an instance-level loss to push apart embeddings from different classes and a class-level loss to pull together an embedding and its corresponding semantic descriptor. The real and synthetic samples embedded in this new space are used to train a supervised classifier for GZSL. This hybrid framework leverages the capability of generative models to synthesize unseen class features while also mapping them to a more discriminative embedding space for classification.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

This paper proposes a new method for generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL). The key points are:- GZSL aims to recognize objects from both seen and unseen classes, when training data is only available for seen classes. This is more challenging than conventional zero-shot learning which only recognizes unseen classes.- Existing methods either use semantic embedding to map visual features to a semantic space, or use generative models to synthesize visual features for unseen classes. Both have limitations:1) Semantic embedding suffers from bias towards seen classes. 2) Original visual feature space used by generative models lacks discriminative ability for GZSL.- This paper proposes a hybrid framework that combines embedding model and generative model:1) Generative model synthesizes visual features for unseen classes.2) An embedding model maps both real (seen) and synthetic (unseen) features into a new embedding space. 3) GZSL classification is performed in this new embedding space using a supervised classifier.- A novel contrastive embedding is proposed, which uses both instance-level and class-level supervisions. This is unlike semantic embedding which only uses class-level supervision.- Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks.In summary, the key contribution is a hybrid GZSL framework with a new contrastive embedding model that leverages both instance-level and class-level supervisions. This allows improving GZSL performance by overcoming limitations of existing semantic embedding and generative feature synthesis methods.
