## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end framework for autonomous driving that takes raw sensor data as input and produces steering and acceleration outputs directly, without requiring intermediate detection or prediction modules. The model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extractor followed by Fully Connected (FC) layers to predict continuous steering and acceleration values. The CNN is pretrained on ImageNet and finetuned on driving datasets to extract visual features relevant for driving. The model is trained using behavior cloning, where it learns to mimic demonstrations from a human driver by minimizing the mean squared error between its predicted controls and the human's actions. Large amounts of training data are collected from real-world driving as well as simulation. At test time, the model takes in images from front-facing cameras and outputs predicted steering and acceleration controls. This end-to-end approach is shown to have advantages over modular pipelines due to its model simplicity, ability to leverage large datasets, and joint optimization of perception and control.
