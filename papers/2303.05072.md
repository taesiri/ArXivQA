# [Identification of Systematic Errors of Image Classifiers on Rare   Subgroups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05072)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we systematically identify cases where image classifiers make errors on rare or underrepresented subgroups, when we do not have labeled examples from those subgroups?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Leveraging recent advances in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion to synthesize examples of rare subgroups specified through text prompts. This allows probing classifier performance on subgroups even if real examples are not available.

- A procedure called PromptAttack that explores a large space of subgroup prompts in a principled way using combinatorial testing. This allows identifying subgroups where classifiers show systematically worse performance.

- Demonstrating PromptAttack can uncover known issues like classifying certain images of people as apes. It also finds new subgroups for ImageNet classifiers where performance drops, requiring a conjunction of factors like color, pose, weather etc.

- Proposing a benchmark for evaluating systematic error identification methods, based on intentionally injecting errors on subgroups into zero-shot classifiers.

Overall, the key insight is that text-to-image synthesis can help probe classifier performance on rare subgroups beyond the available training/test data. The paper shows this can uncover known and previously unknown systematic errors, which is useful for improving model robustness, reliability and fairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing PromptAttack, a new procedure for identifying systematic errors of image classifiers based on synthetically generated images from text-to-image models conditioned on prompts encoding subgroup information. 

2. Using combinatorial testing to explore a large subset of subgroups from an operational design domain, achieving near-equable coverage of the subgroups.

3. Introducing a benchmark for evaluating systematic error identification methods based on zero-shot classifiers constructed from CLIP.

4. Applying PromptAttack to ImageNet classifiers and identifying novel systematic errors on rare subgroups, including fairness issues related to misclassifying people.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel method leveraging advances in text-to-image models to systematically test image classifiers on rare subgroups defined by combinations of semantic attributes. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate PromptAttack can effectively identify systematic errors missed by prior work. The main innovations are the conditional image synthesis for subgroup exploration and the use of combinatorial testing for coverage.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on identifying systematic errors of image classifiers on rare subgroups:

- Leverages text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion to synthetically generate images of rare subgroups defined by textual prompts. This allows testing classifier performance on rare subgroups without needing actual image samples. Other works like DOMINO and AdaVision rely on available datasets which may lack coverage of rare subgroups.  

- Focuses on rare subgroups that require multiple concurrent semantic shifts, rather than just single shifts. For example, identifying that "rear view + small size + orange color + snowy background" concurrently causes misclassifications, not just one of those factors alone. This is a key advantage over perturbation-based approaches.

- Uses combinatorial testing to efficiently search over combinations of factors defining subgroups. This allows covering a large space of potential subgroups efficiently. Other works tend to focus on generating/retrieving examples without structured subgroup search.

- Does not require a human-in-the-loop for interpreting failure cases, as in AdaVision. This enables fully automated auditing. But it means the approach may identify "false positive" subgroups that humans wouldn't consider coherent.

- Evaluated on real ImageNet classifiers, identifying novel subgroups with high misclassification rates. Demonstrates the approach can find systematic errors in real-world models.

- Proposed benchmark based on "zero-shot systematic errors" in CLIP classifiers provides ground truth for quantitative evaluation. Getting ground truth subgroups with errors is a challenge. 

Overall, leveraging text-to-image synthesis and combinatorial search over textual prompts appears to be a promising approach for efficiently discovering systematic errors on rare subgroups. Key advantages over prior work are not needing datasets with subgroup examples and identifying intersectional failures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the text-to-image models used for generating the synthetic data, such as making them more controllable, versatile, and reliable. This could help reduce issues like false positives from out-of-class samples.

- Extending the approach to identify class-agnostic systematic errors, i.e. errors that span multiple classes rather than just misclassifications of a particular source class. 

- Using other types of conditioning information beyond text prompts, such as scene layouts, to deal with concepts that are hard to describe textually.

- Reducing bias propagation from the text-to-image models into the systematic error identification process. This could involve techniques to reduce biases in the generative models themselves.

- Incorporating human feedback into the process to help confirm identified errors and reduce false positives.

- Exploring the approach on broader sets of models and datasets beyond ImageNet classifiers.

- Developing improved quantitative evaluation benchmarks and metrics to better assess the identification of systematic errors.

In summary, the main directions are improving the synthetic data generation process, expanding the scope and generalizability of the approach, reducing propagated biases, and incorporating human oversight to confirm the identified errors. Enhancing the evaluation methodology is also noted as an area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes PromptAttack, a novel method to identify systematic errors of image classifiers on rare subgroups. It leverages recent advances in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion to synthesize images of subgroups by encoding subgroup information directly in the prompt. To deal with the combinatorial explosion of potential subgroups, PromptAttack uses combinatorial testing to explore a large subset of an operational design domain while keeping the number of subgroups small. PromptAttack generates images from prompts, runs them through a classifier, and identifies subgroups where the classifier has low confidence on the original class as potential systematic errors. Experiments show PromptAttack can identify novel systematic errors of ImageNet classifiers on rare subgroups. The method does not require annotated data covering rare subgroups or clustering/captioning failure cases. Limitations are the language bottleneck in describing subgroups as prompts, bias propagation from the text-to-image model, and potential false positive errors. Overall, PromptAttack enables efficiently finding systematic errors on combinations of rare semantic shifts.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method called PromptAttack for identifying systematic errors of image classifiers on rare subgroups. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in text-to-image models to synthesize images of rare subgroups by encoding subgroup information in a prompt. For example, a prompt like "An image of a blue car" can be used to generate images of the rare "blue car" subgroup. Combinatorial testing is used to explore a large subset of subgroups from a prespecified operational design domain while keeping the total number of subgroups small. The synthesized images are fed to the classifier being analyzed, and subgroups for which the classifier has low performance on the prompted images are identified as systematic errors. 

The method is evaluated quantitatively on a benchmark of classifiers with injected zero-shot systematic errors, showing it can accurately identify the errors. It is also applied to ImageNet classifiers, revealing novel systematic errors on rare subgroups related to object color, size, viewpoint etc. that result in misclassifications to semantically similar classes. Limitations are the reliance on the quality of the text-to-image model and the difficulty representing some coherent subgroups textually. Overall, PromptAttack provides an automated way to test image classifiers for systematic failures on rare subgroups, which is useful for improving robustness and fairness. The results demonstrate it can find problematic subgroups not present in the original training data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is called PromptAttack. It is a procedure for identifying systematic errors in image classifiers, where a systematic error refers to a semantically coherent subgroup of the data that the classifier misclassifies with high probability. 

PromptAttack works by leveraging recent progress in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion. It explores subgroups within a predefined operational design domain, which consists of multiple semantic dimensions such as color, weather, background etc. Combinations of values from these dimensions define coherent subgroups. PromptAttack generates synthetic data for a subgroup by instantiating a prompt template with the subgroup's semantic values, and passing this prompt to the text-to-image model to generate images. These synthetic images are then fed to the classifier being analyzed. If the classifier's performance on the synthetic subgroup data is much worse than on the overall data distribution, that subgroup is identified as a systematic error. The prompts found to induce such errors provide an interpretable characterization of where the classifier fails.

The main advantages of PromptAttack are that it can explore rare subgroups not well represented in real datasets, while still focusing on a predefined operational domain rather than open-ended search. By using combinatorial testing across subgroups, it can achieve high coverage of the domain with relatively few subgroups tested. The authors demonstrate PromptAttack can reliably identify systematic errors of ImageNet classifiers on vehicles and persons.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of identifying systematic errors made by image classifiers on rare or underrepresented subgroups in the data. The key questions it seems to tackle are:

1. How can we identify coherent subgroups where an image classifier has significantly worse performance, even though these subgroups may be rare or not represented in the original training data?

2. How can this identification be done efficiently when considering a large space of potential subgroups defined by combinations of semantic attributes (e.g. color, size, background scene etc)? 

3. Can recent advances in text-to-image models be leveraged to synthesize data from specified subgroups to evaluate classifier performance on them?

4. Does evaluating performance on synthetic subgroup data successfully reveal real systematic errors that classifiers make on rare subgroups from real image datasets?

In summary, the paper focuses on developing a method called PromptAttack that can efficiently explore a combinatorially large space of semantic subgroups using text-to-image synthesis, in order to discover coherent subgroups where a classifier's performance is significantly degraded - signifying a systematic error. It aims to do this without needing laborious collection and annotation of real images from these rare subgroups.
