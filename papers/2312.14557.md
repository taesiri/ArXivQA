# [Aurora:Activating Chinese chat capability for Mistral-8x7B sparse   Mixture-of-Experts through Instruction-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key details from this paper:

Problem Statement:
- Current large language models like Mixtral-8x7B do not have great performance on Chinese tasks and conversations.

Proposed Solution:
- Compile three Chinese instruction-following datasets from the open source community, consisting of over 176K  dialogue examples covering multiple domains. 
- Conduct careful data cleaning, filtering and integration to construct a high-quality dataset.
- Perform supervised fine-tuning of the Mixtral-8x7B model on this dataset using Low Rank Adaptation and 4-bit quantization for efficiency.

Model and Evaluations:
- Develop the fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model named "Aurora" specialized for Chinese conversations.
- Assess performance using C-Eval, MMLU and CMMLU benchmarks.

Key Results:
- Aurora achieves scores of 51.9 on C-Eval, 67.74 on MMLU and 49.69 on CMMLU, outperforming existing models.
- The instruction fine-tuning strategy is shown to be effective for the Mixtral-8x7B Mixture-of-Experts model, a significant advancement.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a multi-domain, high-quality Chinese instruction tuning dataset.
- Development and evaluation of instruction-tuned Mixtral-8x7B models showing strong performance on public benchmarks.
- First work to apply instruction tuning to a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of three fine-tuning datasets that can enhance the Chinese conversational capabilities of Mixtral-8x7B: alpaca_data_zh_51k, alpaca_gpt4_data_zh, and sharegpt_70k. The paper conducted comprehensive evaluation and cleaning of these datasets to create a high-quality Chinese instruction tuning dataset suitable for multi-turn dialogue.

2. Development of instruction-tuned Mixtral-8x7B models using the above Chinese dataset. The paper reports benchmark results on C-Eval, MMLU, and CMMLU showing the effectiveness of instruction tuning for improving Mixtral-8x7B's capabilities.

3. This is claimed to be the first work performing instruction tuning on a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model, marking an advancement for enhancing this model architecture.

In summary, the main contributions are creating Chinese instruction tuning datasets, applying instruction tuning to Mixtral-8x7B, and showing strong benchmark results, including outperforming larger models like ChatGPT on some metrics. The instruction tuning of a sparse MoE model is also a novel contribution claimed by the authors.
