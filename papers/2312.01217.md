# [Understanding Opinions Towards Climate Change on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Climate change is a highly debated topic and significant misinformation exists, leading to polarization. 
- The authors aim to understand how real-world events (like COP climate conferences) shape and influence opinions related to climate change on Twitter.

Dataset
- Collected 13.6 million climate change-related tweets from 2006-2019 posted by 3.6 million users.

Analyses Performed
- Hashtag analysis to see top hashtags used. Top ones relate to creativity, spirituality, economy etc.
- Sentiment analysis shows most tweets are neutral, with 19% being negative. 
- Constructed user-user mention temporal graph and analyzed its evolution over time. Number of edges and density increases around COP events.  
- Ran community detection using Louvain algorithm to detect communities before/after COP events. Difficult to draw conclusions on community structure changes from just graph structure.
- Topic modeling using NMF identified topics related to politics, CO2 emissions and abnormal weather patterns.

Key Contributions
- Curated large-scale climate change Twitter dataset and temporal user interaction graph.
- Analyzed hashtags, sentiments and topics of discussion around climate change.
- Tracked evolution of graph structure and communities around COP events over time. 
- Work enables understanding public opinions related to climate change on social media.

Future Work
- Incorporate advanced NLP models and graph neural networks.
- Analyze demographic differences in climate change discussions.

In summary, the paper collects climate change tweets, performs graph and NLP analyses to understand engagement, topics and opinions, and sets up a framework to track climate change communities over time on social media.
