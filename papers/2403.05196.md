## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores a unified model for both visual representation learning and image generation. Currently, these two tasks use separate techniques - representation learning methods like contrastive learning and masked prediction models lack generation capabilities, while autoregressive and diffusion models focus only on image generation. The goal is to develop a model capable of both.

Methodology - Denoising Autoregressive Representation Learning (DARL)
The proposed model employs a decoder-only Transformer that predicts image patches autoregressively based on previously seen patches. Causal masking ensures patches are predicted using only past context. Relative positional encodings are implemented through decomposed rotary position embeddings (2D RoPE). 

The model is first pre-trained using either MSE loss (simpler) or a diffusion objective adapted for conditional patch-level denoising. The diffusion loss enhances the model's generative potential. A tailored noise schedule is used during diffusion training.

The pre-trained representations are evaluated by fine-tuning on image classification tasks. Despite the simple architecture, DARL achieves performance very close (within 1%) of state-of-the-art masked prediction models like MAE.

Main Contributions
- Proposes DARL - the first model combining strengths of autoregressive and diffusion models for unified representation learning and generation.
- Shows pretrained DARL reaches performance comparable to leading perception models, demonstrating potential of generative pretraining.  
- Introduces decomposed 2D RoPE - an effective relative positional encoding implementation for images.
- Reveals different noise schedules preferences for representation learning vs image generation due to model capacity constraints.
- Analyzes impact of architectural choices like patch ordering, and finds raster scan order to be optimal among deterministic orderings.

The model and experiments significantly advance representation learning through generative pretraining. DARL also serves as an important step towards developing a unified model for both visual perception and image generation.
