# [A Survey for Foundation Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Overview
- The paper provides a comprehensive survey on the application of foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), vision models, and multi-modal models, in autonomous driving (AD). 

- It proposes a taxonomy to categorize foundation models for AD based on modalities (language, vision, multi-modal) and functions (planning, prediction, simulation, etc.).

- The goal is to analyze the role of these powerful AI models in advancing AD capabilities and identify limitations and future research directions.

LLMs for AD
- LLMs like GPT-3, with reasoning and knowledge from pre-training, are applied for planning, prediction, simulation, and interfaces. 

- Methods involve prompting the LLM with driving scenario details to output decisions and explanations. LLMs also generate testing scenarios and understand natural language commands.

- Limitations include hallucination errors, latency, dependency on perception systems, and sim-to-real gaps.

Vision Models for AD
- Vision models like SAM are used for 3D object detection and tracking. Diffusion models generate realistic driving videos for simulation.

- Challenges remain in adapting 2D web-trained vision models to handle noisy, sparse 3D AD data.

Multi-Modal Models for AD 
- Leverage multiple modalities for visual understanding, reasoning, risk detection, trajectory forecasting and end-to-end AD.

- Instruction tuning adapts models like CLIP to follow driving commands. Limitations include hallucination and handling multi-sensor inputs.

Future Directions 
- Pre-training on large-scale AD data, alignment using human feedback, optimizing efficiency, adapting 2D models to 3D data.
