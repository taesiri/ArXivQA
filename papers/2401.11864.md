# [Distilling Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities into Small Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, but their massive size makes deployment computationally infeasible. 
- There is a need to compress the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more accessible models without compromising performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Equation-of-Thought Distillation (EoTD) - a novel technique that encapsulates mathematical reasoning into equation systems. Use this to create a dataset and fine-tune small language models (SLMs).
- Propose Mix Thoughts Distillation (MTD) framework that merges EoTD data with chain-of-thought and program-of-thought datasets into one diverse dataset for SLM fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- EoTD significantly boosts mathematical reasoning of SLMs by translating problems into solvable equation systems, avoiding calculation errors.
- MTD amalgamates diverse reasoning patterns - equations, programs and chains of thought - into one dataset, enhancing SLM learning.
- Experiments show EoTD lifts SLM reasoning considerably. MTD enables SLMs to match state-of-the-art LLM performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.
- MTD dataset diversity correlates with improved SLM performance. Reasoning knowledge transfer to smaller models facilitates access to advanced AI.

In summary, this paper introduces distillation techniques to transfer complex LLM reasoning abilities into SLMs below 1B parameters without compromising performance. EoTD and MTD show democratization of reasoning skills to more accessible models is achievable.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces Equation-of-Thought Distillation (EoTD), a novel technique to encapsulate mathematical reasoning into equation-based representations. EoTD is used to construct a dataset to fine-tune small language models (SLMs), significantly boosting their mathematical reasoning abilities.

2. It proposes the Mix Thoughts Distillation (MTD) framework to further enhance SLM reasoning by creating a comprehensive reasoning dataset with multiple thought processes (i.e. chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, equation-of-thought) and using it for fine-tuning. 

3. Experiments demonstrate that EoTD boosts SLM reasoning, while MTD enables SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art reasoning performance on mathematical reasoning datasets. For example, CodeT5-Large fine-tuned with MTD attained 42.45% accuracy on GSM8K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

4. Overall, the paper presents methods to effectively distill complex reasoning capabilities from large language models into small language models for broader deployment, while retaining or even improving reasoning performance. This facilitates the democratization of advanced AI reasoning technologies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces Equation-of-Thought Distillation (EoTD) to encapsulate mathematical reasoning into equation systems. How does handling unknown variables as solutions to these systems differ from the requirement to predefine variables in Program-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD)? What are the relative merits and limitations?

2. The paper proposes using an external equation solver to validate the equation systems generated via EoTD. What are some potential downsides of relying on an external module? How can the robustness of the overall system be improved? 

3. The Mix Thoughts Distillation (MTD) amalgamates CoTD, EoTD and PoTD datasets. What mechanisms allow this composite dataset to provide more comprehensive reasoning knowledge to the student SLMs? How do the prompts used for each thought process contribute?

4. The paper adopts a hierarchical approach during MTD inference where the PoT-generated answer is preferred, followed by EoT if PoT fails. What are some potential issues with this method? Can the selection be improved using confidence scores?  

5. The experimental results demonstrate clear gains from scaling up model size under MTD. Is there a case to be made regarding diminishing returns? At what model scale do the improvements start to taper off?

6. The paper focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks. What adaptations would allow Equation-of-Thought Distillation and Mix Thoughts Distillation to work for non-mathematical domains involving reasoning?

7. The data generation process involves manually created examples to prime the teacher LLM. Would the framework be sensitive to the quality or diversity of these examples? How can this process be standardized?

8. What hybrid approaches can merge the strengths of EoTD and PoTD? Is it feasible to incorporate unknown variables into executable PoT programs? Would this boost performance?

9. The SLMs are currently fine-tuned in a generative manner to produce reasoning paths. Can discriminative fine-tuning further enhance performance? What loss functions would be appropriate in that setting?

10. How do metrics such as sample efficiency, training time, inference latency and memory footprint compare between LLM distillation using CoTD/PoTD/EoTD and standard supervised fine-tuning of SLMs? What efficiency gains can be realized?
