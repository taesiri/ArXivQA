# What Matters in Training a GPT4-Style Language Model with Multimodal   Inputs?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the key factors (network structures, training data, prompts/instructions) that affect the performance of GPT4-style large language models adapted for multi-modal (image/video) understanding and generation?The authors aim to systematically study these factors through controlled experiments and propose an improved model Lynx based on their findings. Specifically, some of the key questions they try to answer are:- How do different LLM backbones and adaptation methods (cross-attention vs prefix-tuning) impact multi-modal performance? - How does the quantity and quality of image-text training data affect multi-modal language generation?- What is the influence of diversified prompts/instructions on the instruction-following ability? - How to balance multi-modal understanding accuracy and open-ended text generation ability in evaluation and training?The central hypothesis seems to be that carefully designed network architecture, high-quality training data, and diversified instructions are crucial for developing high-performing multi-modal LLMs like GPT4. The authors try to verify this through systematic ablation studies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It presents a systematic and comprehensive study on training GPT4-style large language models that can take images/videos as inputs and generate natural language responses. The paper explores different factors that affect model performance, including network structures, training data, prompts/instructions, and evaluation benchmarks. 2. It proposes a new evaluation benchmark with both an accuracy-focused test set (Open-VQA) and a generation quality-focused test set (OwlEval) to assess both understanding and generation abilities of such models.3. It provides an open-sourced model called Lynx, which is a prefix-tuning based GPT4-style model. Through controlled experiments, Lynx is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmarks compared to existing models.4. It draws several useful conclusions/guidelines based on ablation studies and empirical results, such as the effectiveness of prefix-tuning, the importance of high-quality training data, the impact of diverse prompts, and the need to balance accuracy and generation quality.In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive empirical study and a strong open-sourced model to push forward research in training GPT4-style multi-modal large language models. The paper provides useful insights and techniques through systematic experiments and evaluation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a systematic study on training factors like network structures, data, and prompts for multi-modal large language models, and proposes Lynx, a GPT4-style model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by balancing multi-modal understanding and text generation through careful data selection and prompt engineering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper presents a systematic study on training multi-modal large language models like GPT4. This kind of comprehensive empirical analysis and ablation study is relatively rare in the literature, which tends to focus more on proposing new models or techniques. So the paper makes a valuable contribution in analyzing and understanding what really matters for training high-performance multi-modal LLMs.- The paper compares different network architectures like cross-attention vs prefix-tuning, different pretraining strategies, the impact of training data scale and quality, and the importance of diversified prompts/instructions. Many recent papers have explored these factors independently, but this paper studies them together in a unified framework.- For evaluation, the paper proposes a new comprehensive benchmark combining accuracy metrics with human assessments. This addresses limitations of previous benchmarks for generative multi-modal models. The new benchmark provides a fairer way to compare different models.- The proposed model Lynx achieves state-of-the-art results on the new benchmark compared to recent models like BLIP, Flamingo, mPLUG, and MiniGPT. The careful analysis and training approach helps Lynx balance multi-modal understanding and text generation abilities.- Most related works have focused on image-only models. This paper also evaluates video understanding abilities, which is an important emerging direction. The analyses likely provide useful insights for developing video LLMs.Overall, this paper provides one of the most extensive empirical analysis of training multi-modal LLMs published so far. The insights on model architectures, training objectives and data, evaluation, and balancing different capabilities provide a strong foundation for advancing multi-modal LLMs and benchmarks further.
