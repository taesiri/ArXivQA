# What Matters in Training a GPT4-Style Language Model with Multimodal   Inputs?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the key factors (network structures, training data, prompts/instructions) that affect the performance of GPT4-style large language models adapted for multi-modal (image/video) understanding and generation?The authors aim to systematically study these factors through controlled experiments and propose an improved model Lynx based on their findings. Specifically, some of the key questions they try to answer are:- How do different LLM backbones and adaptation methods (cross-attention vs prefix-tuning) impact multi-modal performance? - How does the quantity and quality of image-text training data affect multi-modal language generation?- What is the influence of diversified prompts/instructions on the instruction-following ability? - How to balance multi-modal understanding accuracy and open-ended text generation ability in evaluation and training?The central hypothesis seems to be that carefully designed network architecture, high-quality training data, and diversified instructions are crucial for developing high-performing multi-modal LLMs like GPT4. The authors try to verify this through systematic ablation studies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It presents a systematic and comprehensive study on training GPT4-style large language models that can take images/videos as inputs and generate natural language responses. The paper explores different factors that affect model performance, including network structures, training data, prompts/instructions, and evaluation benchmarks. 2. It proposes a new evaluation benchmark with both an accuracy-focused test set (Open-VQA) and a generation quality-focused test set (OwlEval) to assess both understanding and generation abilities of such models.3. It provides an open-sourced model called Lynx, which is a prefix-tuning based GPT4-style model. Through controlled experiments, Lynx is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmarks compared to existing models.4. It draws several useful conclusions/guidelines based on ablation studies and empirical results, such as the effectiveness of prefix-tuning, the importance of high-quality training data, the impact of diverse prompts, and the need to balance accuracy and generation quality.In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive empirical study and a strong open-sourced model to push forward research in training GPT4-style multi-modal large language models. The paper provides useful insights and techniques through systematic experiments and evaluation.
