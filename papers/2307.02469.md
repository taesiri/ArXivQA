# [What Matters in Training a GPT4-Style Language Model with Multimodal   Inputs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02469)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the key factors (network structures, training data, prompts/instructions) that affect the performance of GPT4-style large language models adapted for multi-modal (image/video) understanding and generation?The authors aim to systematically study these factors through controlled experiments and propose an improved model Lynx based on their findings. Specifically, some of the key questions they try to answer are:- How do different LLM backbones and adaptation methods (cross-attention vs prefix-tuning) impact multi-modal performance? - How does the quantity and quality of image-text training data affect multi-modal language generation?- What is the influence of diversified prompts/instructions on the instruction-following ability? - How to balance multi-modal understanding accuracy and open-ended text generation ability in evaluation and training?The central hypothesis seems to be that carefully designed network architecture, high-quality training data, and diversified instructions are crucial for developing high-performing multi-modal LLMs like GPT4. The authors try to verify this through systematic ablation studies.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a systematic study on training factors like network structures, data, and prompts for multi-modal large language models, and proposes Lynx, a GPT4-style model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by balancing multi-modal understanding and text generation through careful data selection and prompt engineering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper presents a systematic study on training multi-modal large language models like GPT4. This kind of comprehensive empirical analysis and ablation study is relatively rare in the literature, which tends to focus more on proposing new models or techniques. So the paper makes a valuable contribution in analyzing and understanding what really matters for training high-performance multi-modal LLMs.- The paper compares different network architectures like cross-attention vs prefix-tuning, different pretraining strategies, the impact of training data scale and quality, and the importance of diversified prompts/instructions. Many recent papers have explored these factors independently, but this paper studies them together in a unified framework.- For evaluation, the paper proposes a new comprehensive benchmark combining accuracy metrics with human assessments. This addresses limitations of previous benchmarks for generative multi-modal models. The new benchmark provides a fairer way to compare different models.- The proposed model Lynx achieves state-of-the-art results on the new benchmark compared to recent models like BLIP, Flamingo, mPLUG, and MiniGPT. The careful analysis and training approach helps Lynx balance multi-modal understanding and text generation abilities.- Most related works have focused on image-only models. This paper also evaluates video understanding abilities, which is an important emerging direction. The analyses likely provide useful insights for developing video LLMs.Overall, this paper provides one of the most extensive empirical analysis of training multi-modal LLMs published so far. The insights on model architectures, training objectives and data, evaluation, and balancing different capabilities provide a strong foundation for advancing multi-modal LLMs and benchmarks further.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Scaling up the model size and training data amount. The authors mention it could be promising to train even larger models (e.g. 30B or 65B parameters) on more data to further improve performance.- Collecting a large-scale, high-quality multi-modal dataset. The authors emphasize the importance of high-quality training data with fluent text paired well with images. They suggest it's worth the effort to collect such a dataset to support training better multi-modal LLMs.- Improving multi-lingual abilities. The current model is mainly trained on English data, so the authors suggest exploring methods to build models with stronger multi-lingual capabilities.- Enhancing safety and mitigating potential harms. The authors acknowledge the current model lacks safety checks, so investigating techniques to restrict inappropriate or harmful outputs would be important future work.- Developing better evaluation benchmarks. The authors note evaluating multi-modal LLMs is challenging and propose ideas like collecting more diverse test sets. Establishing comprehensive, automatic benchmarks remains an open problem.- Exploring other modalities like audio. The current work focuses on visual inputs, but expanding to other modalities like audio could be interesting future work.- Comparing cross-attention methods more extensively. The authors suggest cross-attention models may require more hyperparameter tuning, so rigorously comparing to prefix-tuning models is needed.In summary, scaling up models, collecting better training data, improving multilinguality and safety, developing robust benchmarks, and expanding to new modalities are called out as promising future research directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a systematic study on training GPT4-style models for multimodal applications. It explores different factors that can affect performance, including network structure, training data, and instructions. Specifically, it compares prefix tuning versus cross attention, examines the impact of noisy versus high-quality data, and analyzes the importance of diversified prompts. Through controlled experiments, the authors find that prefix tuning works better than cross attention, high-quality data is more important than large quantities, and diversified prompts improve instruction following. Based on these findings, the authors present Lynx, a GPT4-style model trained with prefix tuning on clean data and diversified prompts. Lynx achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal understanding while maintaining strong text generation ability compared to existing models. The study provides insights into best practices for training powerful multimodal LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a systematic study on training GPT4-style large language models to follow open-ended instructions given images or videos. The authors explore different factors that can impact performance, including network structure, training data, and instruction prompts. They implement around 20 variants with controlled settings to analyze the effects. For network structure, the authors find prefix-tuning performs better than cross-attention for fusing modalities. For training data, they show quality is more important than quantity, as large noisy datasets can contaminate the language model. For instructions, diversified prompts are crucial for improving instruction-following. Based on these findings, the authors propose Lynx, a prefix-tuning GPT4 model trained on high-quality image-text data and instructional tasks. Lynx outperforms prior models in multi-modal understanding while maintaining strong text generation ability. The study provides insights into training recipes and data for advancing multi-modal large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents Lynx, a GPT4-style large language model that can take images and videos as inputs. Lynx is built on top of Vicuna, a 7B parameter instruction-finetuned language model, and is further trained with additional trainable adapters on high-quality image-text pairs and visual language tasks. The model uses a simple prefix-tuning architecture, where the vision tokens are directly concatenated with the text tokens as input to the auto-regressive decoder-only transformer. Small trainable adapters are added after each layer to help align the vision and text modalities. Lynx is trained in two stages - first on over 120M image-text pairs to build connections between vision and language, and then finetuned on over 50 visual question answering, captioning, classification, and dialog tasks that have been converted to an instruction-following format using manually created and GPT4-generated prompts. This two-stage approach allows Lynx to achieve accurate multi-modal understanding while maintaining strong text generation abilities.
