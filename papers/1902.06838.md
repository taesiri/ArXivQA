# SC-FEGAN: Face Editing Generative Adversarial Network with User's Sketch   and Color

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an image editing system that can generate realistic and high-quality edits to facial images based on free-form user inputs like masks, sketches, and colors. The key hypothesis is that a neural network model trained on appropriate data with proper loss functions can produce synthetic facial images that reflect a user's desired edits, as specified through free-form mask, sketch, and color inputs.Some key points:- The paper proposes a new system called SC-FEGAN that allows intuitive editing of facial images using free-form user inputs. - It aims to improve upon limitations of prior work like awkward edges, inability to handle large missing regions, and lack of user control.- The proposed model is an end-to-end trainable convolutional network that incorporates style loss for better results when large regions are missing.- It uses a U-Net architecture with gated convolutions and trained adversarially along with other loss functions.- The training data incorporates free-form masks, sketches, and color maps to enable the model to handle free-form inputs.So in summary, the main research goal is developing an intuitive facial image editing system using a specially designed deep learning model and appropriate training procedure. The key hypothesis is that this approach can enable high-quality editing from free-form user inputs.
