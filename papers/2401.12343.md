# [Subgraph Extraction-based Feedback-guided Iterative Scheduling for HLS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High-level synthesis (HLS) scheduling relies on estimating operation delays and resources based on characterizations done in isolation. This fails to model optimizations done by downstream tools like logic synthesizers.
- As a result, HLS scheduling quality degrades substantially compared to actual post-synthesis results. This leaves unused slack that could have been used to further optimize the design.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes ISDC, an iterative scheduling algorithm that uses feedback from downstream tools to refine scheduling. 
- Key ideas include:
  - Enhanced SDC formulation to integrate downstream tool feedback into scheduling constraints
  - Fanout-driven and window-based subgraph extraction to identify key areas of the design to get feedback on
  - Iterative approach to progressively improve scheduling quality rather than attempt full co-optimization

Main Contributions:
- A novel HLS scheduling algorithm that leverages downstream tool feedback to reduce register usage by 28.5%
- Strategies like fanout-driven subgraph extraction to improve quality and convergence speed of iterations
- An automated flow compatible with different downstream tools, requiring no human involvement
- Thorough evaluation on real-world designs showing benefits on register usage and slack with reasonable runtime overheads

In summary, the paper identifies a key shortcoming in conventional HLS scheduling and proposes an iterative, feedback-directed approach to address it. By using feedback from downstream logic synthesis, the technique is able to refine the HLS schedule to significantly reduce register usage. The automated flow and demonstrated benefits make it an intriguing avenue for further research and adoption.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an iterative scheduling algorithm for high-level synthesis that leverages feedback from downstream logic synthesis tools to progressively refine the schedule and reduce register usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing ISDC, a novel feedback-guided iterative system of difference constraints (SDC) scheduling algorithm for high-level synthesis (HLS). The key innovations include:

1) An enhanced SDC formulation that effectively integrates low-level feedback from downstream tools like logic synthesizers to iteratively refine HLS scheduling. 

2) A fanout and window-based subgraph extraction mechanism that drives the feedback cycle by extracting meaningful combinational logic to be evaluated by downstream tools.

3) A no-human-in-loop ISDC flow that is compatible with a wide range of downstream tools and process design kits (PDKs). 

The paper shows through experiments that ISDC can reduce register usage by 28.5% on average compared to traditional SDC scheduling, at the cost of longer scheduling time. The main contribution is introducing the concept of leveraging low-level feedback to guide and refine high-level synthesis scheduling decisions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper mentions that the delay estimations from high-level synthesis (HLS) tools can deviate significantly from the actual delays after logic synthesis. What are some reasons that could cause these deviations? How can the deviations be quantified or modeled?

2) The paper proposes an iterative approach to integrate low-level feedback into HLS scheduling. What are the tradeoffs between doing more iterations with fewer subgraphs versus fewer iterations with more subgraphs per iteration? How can the optimal balance be determined? 

3) The fanout-driven subgraph extraction strategy prioritizes registers with fewer users. However, some high fanout nodes may still be critical path limiters. How can the strategy be extended to also consider high fanout nodes?

4) The window-based subgraph extraction aims to capture inter-node optimizations. However, excessive window sizes increase runtime. What heuristics can be used to control or adapt the window size? Are there ways to model the optimization opportunity versus runtime tradeoff?  

5) The delay updating algorithm uses an O(n^2) shortest path estimation. Can graph algorithms like Bellman-Ford be applied to reduce the complexity while preserving accuracy? What would be the runtime-quality tradeoffs?

6) The evaluation uses a fixed 15 iterations across all benchmarks. How can the number of iterations be automatically determined based on metrics related to solution quality convergence? What metrics would be good convergence indicators?

7) The proposed flow targets an ASIC standard cell flow. What modifications would be needed to apply it to FPGA high level synthesis, given FPGA architectural features like LUT mapping and carry chains? 

8) The runtime overhead comes from downstream tool invocations like logic synthesis. Are there ways to create fast analytical delay models to avoid invoking downstream tools in every iteration?

9) Can machine learning techniques be applied to learn and predict the deviations between HLS estimations and actual delays? How can the predictions be integrated into the iterative flow?

10) The paper mentions future possibilities like co-optimizing scheduling with logic synthesis. What are the main challenges in realizing such a simultaneously optimized flow? How can the scheduling and logic synthesis spaces be jointly formulated and solved?
