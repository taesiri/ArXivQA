# [ResAdapter: Domain Consistent Resolution Adapter for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02084)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ResAdapter: Domain Consistent Resolution Adapter for Diffusion Models":

Problem:
Recent text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and personalized models trained with DreamBooth can generate high-quality images. However, they suffer from limitations when generating images at resolutions outside their trained resolution domain, exhibiting poor fidelity at lower resolutions and poor composition at higher resolutions. This is referred to as "resolution domain inconsistency". Existing solutions use complex post-processing or fine-tuning that transforms the model's original style domain.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose ResAdapter, a lightweight plug-and-play adapter module to enable diffusion models to generate high-quality images at flexible resolutions without changing the model's style domain. 

Key ideas:
- Identify convolution layers as resolution-sensitive while attention layers retain more style information
- Propose ResCLoRA module that adapts convolution receptive field to match image resolution 
- Propose ResENorm to adapt normalization layers for better extrapolation
- Insert modules in specific locations to focus on resolution and avoid style domain shift
- Simple mixed-resolution training strategy to handle multiple resolutions

Contributions:
- ResAdapter enables interpolation and extrapolation over a wide range of resolutions for arbitrary diffusion models without compromising style domain
- Compatible as a "plug-and-play" module with other extensions like conditional control, image prompts, inference acceleration
- Lightweight (0.5M parameters) and efficient generation without complex post-processing 
- Can optimize inference time when combined with other multi-resolution methods based on post-processing

In summary, ResAdapter is a domain-consistent adapter for enabling flexible high-quality image resolution generation for any diffusion model, with broad compatibility and low training and inference costs. Experiments validate effectiveness over personalized and base models across resolution ranges.
