# [Improving Socratic Question Generation using Data Augmentation and   Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the problem of automatically generating Socratic questions to guide students in debugging their code and help improve their learning outcomes. Manually creating such questions is labor-intensive for instructors. Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted to generate these questions. However, existing methods that prompt proprietary LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 sometimes produce invalid questions that are irrelevant, repetitive, too direct by revealing solutions prematurely, or prematurely prompt students to fix code before identifying the root cause.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a two-phase method to generate valid Socratic questions using open-source LLMs. 
1) Data Augmentation: Invalid questions are synthetically generated by prompting GPT-4. These augment existing datasets to create preference pairs of valid and invalid questions.  
2) Preference Optimization: An open-source 7B parameter LLM - Llama 2 is fine-tuned on the preference dataset using direct preference optimization (DPO). DPO minimizes the likelihood of invalid questions while keeping valid questions likely.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a data augmentation method to create invalid Socratic questions for training question generation models.  
- Shows that preference-optimizing Llama 2 with 7B parameters outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods relying on proprietary 25B+ parameter models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in terms of text similarity metrics to ground truth questions.
- Provides an effective and scalable method for Socratic question generation without relying on expensive proprietary LLMs.
- Consistently shows DPO outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning across different decoding methods, justifying the need for preference optimization.

The paper demonstrates an effective way to take advantage of large proprietary LLMs to augment datasets for fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs, which can then match or outperform the proprietary models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to improve Socratic question generation from open-source language models by first augmenting the dataset with invalid questions generated by a larger proprietary LLM, and then optimizing a smaller open-source LLM using the augmented dataset and direct preference optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a data augmentation method to create negative samples, i.e. invalid questions, to help train LLM-based Socratic question generation methods.

2. Using the preference information in the dataset, i.e. pairs of valid and invalid Socratic questions, to optimize Llama 2, an open-source LLM, using direct preference optimization (DPO).

3. Showing that using the 7B Llama 2 model (with 7B parameters), their best method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on larger, proprietary models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in terms of BERTScore and Rouge-L recall.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a data augmentation and preference optimization method to improve Socratic question generation from open-source LLMs, which outperforms existing methods relying on larger proprietary LLMs.

It leverages techniques from reinforcement learning with AI feedback and proposes methods to create augmented data with invalid questions and then perform direct preference optimization on an open-source LLM to align it better with human preferences. The key goal is generating high-quality Socratic questions that can effectively guide students in debugging code without revealing solutions directly.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The data augmentation phase involves generating invalid Socratic questions via GPT-4. What are some potential issues with using an LLM like GPT-4 to generate invalid questions, in terms of bias or hallucination? How do the authors try to mitigate these issues?

2. The authors perform a consistency checking step on the invalid Socratic questions generated by GPT-4. What is the goal of this step and how is it implemented? What are the categories used to classify the generated questions? 

3. The preference dataset consists of pairs of valid and invalid Socratic questions. What strategies could be used to create more diverse pairs rather than pairing each valid question with every invalid question? How might this impact model performance?  

4. The authors use direct preference optimization (DPO) to optimize Llama 2 on the preference dataset. What are the advantages of using DPO over traditional reinforcement learning methods for preference optimization?  

5. The authors experiment with different decoding methods like greedy and nucleus sampling. What is the tradeoff in using greedy vs stochastic decoding for Socratic question generation? How does the choice impact model performance?

6. The authors find that DPO outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), with the gap decreasing as more questions are generated. What explains this trend? How could the relative gains of DPO over SFT be further improved?  

7. The authors use a 7B parameter Llama 2 model. How would using a larger model impact the results? Would we expect to see even higher gains from DPO with larger models? Why or why not?

8. Could the proposed data augmentation and DPO method be applied to other dialogue based applications like conversational search or emotional support chatbots? What challenges might arise?

9. The invalid Socratic questions are currently grouped into four broad categories. Would creating more fine-grained categories be beneficial? What kinds of sub-categories could be considered under each invalid type?

10. The authors find higher recall but lower precision compared to GPT models. What techniques could be used to increase precision without compromising on recall? Could we adapt ranking methods used in other NLG tasks?
