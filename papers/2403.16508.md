# [Return to Tradition: Learning Reliable Heuristics with Classical Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current deep learning approaches for learning for automated planning have issues with needing to tune many hyperparameters, lacking interpretability, and being computationally demanding. They also have not achieved competitive performance against classical planners.

- Prior classical machine learning methods for learning for planning predate deep learning approaches but have not been revisited.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes WL-GOOSE, a new approach that leverages classical machine learning for learning for automated planning. 

- It introduces the Instance Learning Graph (ILG), a novel graph-based representation of lifted planning tasks. The nodes represent objects and facts (propositions) in the initial state and goal. Edges connect facts to the objects they contain.

- It runs a modified Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm on the ILG to generate graph feature vectors. The features are domain-independent and do not require backpropagation.

- The WL features are then used to train classical machine learning models like support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian processes (GP) to learn domain-specific heuristics.

Main Contributions:

- First learned heuristic to outperform h^FF and achieve high coverage across planning domains. The SVM/GP heuristics solve up to 490 problems, outperforming h^FF's 430 problems solved.

- First learned heuristic to match or exceed LAMA's performance on 4 out of 10 domains on coverage and 7 out of 10 on plan quality. 

- Up to 3 orders of magnitude faster training time than graph neural networks. Extremely sample efficient with under 100 training instances.

- Provides theoretical analysis showing WL features are equally powerful to GNNs for planning and incomparable to Description Logic features.

- Demonstrates interpretability of the classical ML models by visualizing most important WL features.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and efficient approach to learning for planning that matches and even exceeds the state-of-the-art in performance. It leverages classical ML to overcome limitations of deep learning techniques. The promising empirical results combined with theoretical connections make this an important contribution.
