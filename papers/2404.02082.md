# [WcDT: World-centric Diffusion Transformer for Traffic Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02082)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic and diverse trajectories for autonomous vehicles in traffic simulators is challenging. Existing methods have limitations in jointly generating coherent trajectories for all agents in a scene, ensuring diversity, and incorporating comprehensive global information. 

Proposed Solution - World-Centric Diffusion Transformer (WcDT):
The paper proposes a novel framework called "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer" that integrates diffusion models and transformers for optimized end-to-end trajectory generation.

Key ideas:
- Unified coordinate system to represent all agents, maps, traffic lights instead of individual coordinate frames. Enhances clarity.
- Action diffusion module based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Diffusion Transformers that encodes historical trajectories into latent space. Increases trajectory diversity.  
- Scene encoder effectively fuses information from predicted agents, world agents, maps, traffic lights using self-attention and cross-attention transformer blocks. Captures dependencies.
- Trajectory decoder leverages GRU and MLP blocks to decode fused traffic features and output multimodal future trajectories for all agents simultaneously.

Main Contributions:
- Novel paradigm to concurrently generate coherent and joint future movements for all agents in one inference pass
- Innovative Diffusion-Transformer module to significantly enrich scene diversity and agent behavior stochasticity
- State-of-the-art performance on traffic dataset, highlighted by realism and diversity of generated trajectories
- Publicly released implementation to facilitate future research

In summary, the proposed WcDT framework sets a new benchmark for joint and efficient trajectory generation for all agents in a scene by synergistically combining strengths of diffusion models and transformers. Evaluations demonstrate leading performance.
