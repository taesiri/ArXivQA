# [Zero-Shot Listwise Document Reranking with a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can a zero-shot listwise reranker utilizing a large language model achieve better effectiveness than existing zero-shot pointwise rerankers for text ranking tasks?The key hypothesis is that by taking multiple candidate documents into account simultaneously, a listwise reranker can better model the relative relevance between documents compared to a pointwise reranker that scores each document independently. The authors propose a listwise reranker called LRL that uses GPT-3 to directly generate a re-ranked list of document identifiers given a query and candidate documents. They evaluate LRL on TREC web search datasets and subsets of the MIRACL multilingual dataset and find that it outperforms existing zero-shot pointwise rerankers like UPR and BM25 without requiring any task-specific training data.In summary, the central research question is whether a zero-shot listwise reranker can outperform pointwise alternatives, with the hypothesis that modeling multiple documents jointly enables better capturing of relative document relevance. The authors propose and evaluate LRL to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing LRL, a zero-shot listwise reranking method that uses a large language model (LLM) to directly generate a re-ranked list of documents given a query and a list of candidate documents. The key ideas are:- Using an LLM in a listwise manner to consider multiple candidate documents simultaneously when reranking, instead of scoring them independently like existing pointwise methods. - Designing a simple prompt that instructs the LLM to take a query and list of candidate passages and output a new ordered list of passage IDs sorted by relevance.- Showing that LRL outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot pointwise reranking methods like UPR on several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the listwise approach.- Applying LRL to multilingual retrieval by evaluating on subsets of the MIRACL benchmark, where it also shows strong improvements, highlighting its potential for cross-lingual generalization.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of a novel zero-shot listwise reranking approach using LLMs that does not require any task-specific training data. The results show it outperforms pointwise methods and works across multiple languages.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a zero-shot listwise document reranking method called LRL that uses GPT-3 to directly reorder a list of documents by relevance to a query. Experiments on TREC and MIRACL datasets show it outperforms existing pointwise reranking methods without requiring any task-specific training data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other work in zero-shot text reranking:- The main contribution is proposing a listwise reranking approach (LRL) using a large language model, rather than the typical pointwise ranking methods. Listwise ranking considers multiple documents together when computing relevance, while pointwise scores them independently.- LRL achieves strong results on TREC web search datasets without any task-specific training, outperforming existing zero-shot methods like BM25, Contriever, and UPR. The gains over pointwise ranking with LLMs are around 6 points in nDCG@10.- The paper demonstrates LRL's effectiveness across multiple languages by experimenting on subsets of the MIRACL multilingual dataset. This is useful since LLMs can handle many languages.- The work fits into a line of research exploring unsupervised neural ranking with LLMs, like InPars and PromptAugator which generate synthetic training data. However, LRL uses the LLM directly for ranking rather than pre-training with augmented data.- Compared to supervised neural rankers, LRL lags behind in terms of effectiveness, but doesn't require relevance judgments for training. There is still a gap between zero-shot methods and supervised models.- A limitation is the reliance on GPT-3, which may have overlaps between its training data and test sets. But the core ideas could extend to other LLMs.Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution in exploring listwise ranking for zero-shot retrieval. The gains over pointwise ranking are noteworthy. It also demonstrates the potential for LLMs to generalize across languages. More work is still needed to close the gap with supervised ranking.
