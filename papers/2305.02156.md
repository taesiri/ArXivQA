# [Zero-Shot Listwise Document Reranking with a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02156)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can a zero-shot listwise reranker utilizing a large language model achieve better effectiveness than existing zero-shot pointwise rerankers for text ranking tasks?

The key hypothesis is that by taking multiple candidate documents into account simultaneously, a listwise reranker can better model the relative relevance between documents compared to a pointwise reranker that scores each document independently. The authors propose a listwise reranker called LRL that uses GPT-3 to directly generate a re-ranked list of document identifiers given a query and candidate documents. They evaluate LRL on TREC web search datasets and subsets of the MIRACL multilingual dataset and find that it outperforms existing zero-shot pointwise rerankers like UPR and BM25 without requiring any task-specific training data.

In summary, the central research question is whether a zero-shot listwise reranker can outperform pointwise alternatives, with the hypothesis that modeling multiple documents jointly enables better capturing of relative document relevance. The authors propose and evaluate LRL to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LRL, a zero-shot listwise reranking method that uses a large language model (LLM) to directly generate a re-ranked list of documents given a query and a list of candidate documents. The key ideas are:

- Using an LLM in a listwise manner to consider multiple candidate documents simultaneously when reranking, instead of scoring them independently like existing pointwise methods. 

- Designing a simple prompt that instructs the LLM to take a query and list of candidate passages and output a new ordered list of passage IDs sorted by relevance.

- Showing that LRL outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot pointwise reranking methods like UPR on several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the listwise approach.

- Applying LRL to multilingual retrieval by evaluating on subsets of the MIRACL benchmark, where it also shows strong improvements, highlighting its potential for cross-lingual generalization.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of a novel zero-shot listwise reranking approach using LLMs that does not require any task-specific training data. The results show it outperforms pointwise methods and works across multiple languages.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a zero-shot listwise document reranking method called LRL that uses GPT-3 to directly reorder a list of documents by relevance to a query. Experiments on TREC and MIRACL datasets show it outperforms existing pointwise reranking methods without requiring any task-specific training data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other work in zero-shot text reranking:

- The main contribution is proposing a listwise reranking approach (LRL) using a large language model, rather than the typical pointwise ranking methods. Listwise ranking considers multiple documents together when computing relevance, while pointwise scores them independently.

- LRL achieves strong results on TREC web search datasets without any task-specific training, outperforming existing zero-shot methods like BM25, Contriever, and UPR. The gains over pointwise ranking with LLMs are around 6 points in nDCG@10.

- The paper demonstrates LRL's effectiveness across multiple languages by experimenting on subsets of the MIRACL multilingual dataset. This is useful since LLMs can handle many languages.

- The work fits into a line of research exploring unsupervised neural ranking with LLMs, like InPars and PromptAugator which generate synthetic training data. However, LRL uses the LLM directly for ranking rather than pre-training with augmented data.

- Compared to supervised neural rankers, LRL lags behind in terms of effectiveness, but doesn't require relevance judgments for training. There is still a gap between zero-shot methods and supervised models.

- A limitation is the reliance on GPT-3, which may have overlaps between its training data and test sets. But the core ideas could extend to other LLMs.

Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution in exploring listwise ranking for zero-shot retrieval. The gains over pointwise ranking are noteworthy. It also demonstrates the potential for LLMs to generalize across languages. More work is still needed to close the gap with supervised ranking.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Continuing to explore the potential of large language models for text retrieval. The authors state that this work "only begins to scratch the surface" of using LLMs for retrieval. They are excited about further exploring LLMs for retrieval in the future.

- Evaluating on more datasets and languages to further analyze the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed LRL approach. The authors experimented on 3 languages from MIRACL, but suggest evaluating on more languages, especially low-resource ones.

- Comparing with other potential zero-shot listwise ranking methods besides the pointwise methods experimented with. The authors mainly compare LRL to pointwise ranking methods like BM25, Contriever, and UPR. Comparing to other potential listwise approaches could further analyze the benefits of LRL's listwise approach.

- Analyzing the tradeoffs between effectiveness and efficiency for the progressive reranking strategy proposed. The paper introduces the sliding window reranking strategy but does not deeply analyze its efficiency vs effectiveness tradeoffs.

- Exploring the benefits of fine-tuning or other techniques to adapt the general LLM to the target retrieval tasks vs keeping the model completely zero-shot.

In summary, the main suggestions are to conduct more extensive experiments analyzing the effectiveness of LRL on more datasets/languages, compare to other listwise methods, study the efficiency tradeoffs of the approach, and explore techniques like fine-tuning to potentially improve results further. The overarching direction is continuing to explore LLMs for text retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes LRL, a zero-shot listwise document reranking method using large language models. LRL takes a query and a list of candidate documents as input, and directly outputs a re-ordered list of document identifiers based on relevance to the query. This contrasts with existing pointwise rerankers like UPR which score documents independently. Experiments on TREC DL datasets show LRL outperforms pointwise rerankers like UPR and PRL by around 6 nDCG@10 points on average. LRL also shows strong performance on non-English MIRACL datasets, demonstrating its multilingual capability. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a simple listwise reranking approach with large language models, without requiring any task-specific training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new zero-shot listwise document reranking method called LRL that utilizes large language models (LLMs). Existing reranking methods are typically pointwise, scoring documents independently. In contrast, LRL takes a query and list of documents as input, and directly outputs a re-ranked list of document identifiers. Experiments on TREC web search datasets show LRL outperforms current state-of-the-art zero-shot pointwise rerankers like UPR by around 6 nDCG@10 points on average. LRL also beats BM25 by 15 nDCG@10 points on multilingual MIRACL subsets, demonstrating potential across languages. Though LRL lags sophisticated supervised methods, it does beat some supervised models like DPR without any task-specific training. The authors posit listwise reranking better captures relative document relevance versus pointwise independent scoring. Overall, this exploratory work shows promise in leveraging LLMs more effectively for text retrieval via simple listwise ranking.

In summary, this paper explores using large language models like GPT-3 for zero-shot listwise document reranking, taking a query and document list as input to directly output a re-ranked list. Experiments demonstrate their proposed LRL method outperforms current best zero-shot pointwise rerankers, which score documents independently, on TREC web search and multilingual datasets. The results showcase the potential of large language models for text retrieval through simple listwise ranking approaches that consider multiple documents simultaneously. While lagging sophisticated supervised methods, LRL does surpass some supervised models without task-specific training, warranting further exploration in this direction.
