## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Communication networks for multi-robot systems is an important research topic related to Industry 4.0. However, in complex environments, establishing reliable wireless links for small robots to estimate the channel is challenging.  

- Prior work has proposed some channel estimation methods for small robots but experimental studies are still quite new. Commercial products often use proprietary hardware which is difficult to modify.

- Software defined radios (SDRs) provide flexibility for research but their ability to deploy on resource-constrained robots has not been well explored.

Solution:
- The authors build an experimental system with two mobile robots, each equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3 and a BladeRF x115 SDR device. The robots use OFDM modulation over 2.4GHz ISM band for communication.

- The open-source SDR4All codebase implementing 802.11-style OFDM is used. It employs a Zero Forcing (ZF) channel equalizer to estimate the channel based on known pilot symbols. The bit error rate (BER) performance is evaluated.

- Simulation in GNU Radio and experiments are conducted with robots both stationary and moving at 0.3m/s velocity. BER vs SNR curves are plotted at different robot distances.

Contributions:
- Implementation of channel simulation blocks in GNU Radio and computation of BER.  

- Experimental evaluation of channel estimation quality in a dual robot system using SDRs, for both static and mobile cases.

- Demonstration of feasibility of applying SDRs for multi-robot communication networks research. Identification of limitations in the channel equalizer of SDR4All codebase.

- Provision of GNU Radio flowgraphs, BER measurement blocks and experimental data to enable further research in this area.

In summary, the paper presents an SDR-based testbed for multi-robot communications and experiments showing reasonably low BERs for both stationary and mobile robots. It discusses the trade-offs and provides building blocks for researchers to conduct further work in this domain.
