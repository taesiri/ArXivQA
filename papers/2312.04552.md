# [Generating Illustrated Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04552)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the novel task of generating "Illustrated Instructions" - customized visual instructions tailored to a user's needs. The authors identify unique requirements for this task: goal faithfulness (images match the overall goal), step faithfulness (each image matches its caption), and cross-image consistency (images in a sequence are coherent). To tackle this, they propose StackedDiffusion, which combines large language models (LLMs) to generate text instructions with text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to generate corresponding illustrations. Specifically, StackedDiffusion spatially stacks multiple latent representations during training and generation to encourage consistency across the image sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StackedDiffusion convincingly outperforms all baselines and even matches human performance in 30% of cases. Notably, by combining flexible text generation and tailored visuals, StackedDiffusion enables new applications like personalized instructions, error correction, and goal suggestions - far beyond what static instructional articles on the web can provide. The method thus represents an important step towards models that can not just tell users how to accomplish tasks, but also show them.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the novel task of generating illustrated step-by-step instructions customized to a user's text query, proposes a method called StackedDiffusion that combines large language models with diffusion models for text and image generation, and shows this approach outperforms baselines while enabling new applications like personalized instructions and error correction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces the novel task of generating "Illustrated Instructions", which involves generating a set of steps with visualizations to solve a user's goal or task. It also identifies key desiderata (goal faithfulness, step faithfulness, cross-image consistency) and metrics for this task.

2) It proposes a new model called StackedDiffusion to generate illustrated instructions by combining large language models (LLMs) with strong text-to-image diffusion models. The model employs techniques like spatial tiling, text embedding concatenation, and step-positional encodings to meet the desiderata of the task.

3) It shows through extensive experiments that the proposed StackedDiffusion model outperforms various baselines and prior state-of-the-art multimodal models on both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The model even produces some illustrations preferred over human-created ones in 30% of cases.

4) It demonstrates new capabilities enabled by StackedDiffusion like personalized instructions, goal suggestions, and error corrections, that go beyond what static instructional articles on the web can provide.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing language models can provide text instructions to achieve goals, but cannot generate corresponding visual illustrations. Visuals are critical for users to effectively understand and follow instructions.
- Simply concatenating existing text-to-image (T2I) models fails to produce useful illustrations that are faithful to both the overall goal and individual steps. The images also lack consistency.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces the novel task of "Generating Illustrated Instructions", which requires producing text steps along with associated images that help users achieve a goal. 
- They propose StackedDiffusion, which leverages diffusion models for text-conditional image generation. It encodes the goal and step texts separately, then concatenates them to condition image generation.
- To enable cross-image consistency, it generates all images together in a spatially tiled latent space. This allows the model to transfer common aspects across the image sequence.

Key Contributions:
1) Formalizes task of "Illustrated Instructions" with desiderata of goal faithfulness, step faithfulness and cross-image consistency. Introduces metrics to measure these.
2) Proposes StackedDiffusion which combines LLMs and diffusion models in a novel way to generate illustrated instructions without any learned parameters. Achieves strong performance.  
3) Comprehensive experiments show StackedDiffusion outperforms baselines. Human evaluations show it even surpasses human-written articles 30% of the time.
4) Showcases new applications enabled such as personalization, goal suggestion and error correction.

In summary, the paper tackles the novel and important task of generating visual instructions customized to users' needs. The proposed StackedDiffusion approach combines strengths of LLMs and diffusion models to accomplish this effectively. Thorough experiments validate the strong performance.
