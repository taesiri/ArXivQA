# [PARs: Predicate-based Association Rules for Efficient and Accurate   Model-Agnostic Anomaly Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
While new methods for anomaly detection are frequently proposed, providing accurate explanations for why specific data instances are detected as anomalies is an equally important but understudied problem. Existing model-agnostic anomaly explanation methods either just identify abnormal features without explaining why they are abnormal, or use time-consuming perturbation-based strategies to explain model predictions which are less applicable for online anomaly detection applications.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel approach called Predicate-based Association Rules (PARs) for efficient and accurate model-agnostic anomaly explanation on tabular data. PARs are in the form of "IF antecedent predicates THEN consequent predicate" that describe normal data patterns. They can explain anomalies by identifying the predicate that is violated and giving the reason why it is violated.  

The key ideas are:
(1) Learn a set of PARs from training data in a data-driven way. This involves predicate generation for categorical/numerical features and association rule mining.
(2) For a detected anomaly, efficiently find the top few accurate PARs that the instance violates to explain why it is anomalous.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces PARs, an intuitive rule-based anomaly explanation form that is preferred by users.
- Provides an efficient data-driven approach to construct and find precise PARs to explain anomalies. Reduces explanation rule search time from tens of seconds to <1 second compared to anchors.  
- Experiments show PARs achieve higher accuracy for anomaly explanation than anchors and other methods like LIME/SHAP in identifying abnormal features.
- Overall, PARs make an valuable practical contribution for providing intuitive explanations in anomaly detection applications.

In summary, this paper presents PARs to address the important but understudied problem of accurate and efficient anomaly explanation. The data-driven rule-based method achieves superior efficiency and accuracy over anchors and other methods.
