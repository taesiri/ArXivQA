# [Learning From Scenarios for Stochastic Repairable Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03492)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using decision-focused learning (DFL) for a stochastic resource-constrained project scheduling problem where task durations are uncertain. The authors apply an existing DFL technique based on stochastic smoothing to handle the non-differentiability of the optimization problem. They introduce a post-hoc regret loss that accounts for the need to repair an initial schedule when uncertain task durations are revealed. Through experiments on project scheduling benchmark instances, they compare the DFL approach to using deterministic averages and a stochastic programming formulation. The results demonstrate that DFL scales better than stochastic programming and performs significantly better on larger problem instances. Overall, the paper shows promise for using DFL in scheduling applications with uncertainty in constraints, rather than just objectives. It also highlights DFL's flexibility in modeling different repair strategies compared to the limitations of stochastic programming approaches. Key future work includes incorporating feature data and testing alternative gradient estimators from reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper explores applying decision-focused learning, which uses stochastic smoothing to enable gradient-based optimization, to a stochastic resource-constrained project scheduling problem with uncertain processing times and a repair policy to handle resulting infeasibilities, comparing its performance to deterministic and stochastic programming approaches across problem instances of varying sizes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is threefold:

1) It applies decision-focused learning (DFL) for the first time to a repairable stochastic scheduling problem with stochastic processing times. 

2) It demonstrates how an existing DFL technique that uses stochastic smoothing can be adapted to serve a stochastic scheduling problem where historical realizations of processing times are used.

3) It includes an extensive experimental evaluation to investigate in which situations DFL outperforms the state of the art for such problems: scenario-based stochastic optimization.

In summary, the key contribution is exploring and evaluating the novel application of decision-focused learning to a stochastic scheduling problem, in particular showing how an existing smoothing-based DFL approach can be tailored to this problem setting and comparing its performance to stochastic optimization methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel application of decision-focused learning (DFL) to a stochastic resource-constrained project scheduling problem with repairs. How does handling uncertainty in the constraints through DFL in this problem setting differ from prior DFL literature that focused more on uncertainty in objectives?

2. The paper utilizes a stochastic estimator to smooth the non-differentiable post-hoc regret function and enable gradient-based optimization. What are the key assumptions made about the parameterized distribution used as the stochastic estimator? How does the choice of distribution relate to policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning?

3. The paper demonstrates the application of an existing DFL technique based on stochastic smoothing. What modifications were made to align this technique to the scheduling problem studied? How were the trainable parameters of the stochastic estimator initialized?  

4. What scheduling repair policy is used in the paper? How does the repair penalty term in the post-hoc regret account for deviations caused by repairs? Could other repair policies be easily incorporated into the DFL framework presented?

5. The experimental evaluation compares DFL against a deterministic and a stochastic optimization approach. Under what conditions does the stochastic method tend to outperform? When does DFL show better scalability? What causes the scalability issues for stochastic programming observed?

6. The paper hypothesizes better DFL performance in settings with feature data related to the uncertain parameters. What is the intuition behind this? How might additional features be incorporated into the DFL approach presented?

7. Could the DFL method proposed be applied to other variants of stochastic scheduling problems? What modifications would need to be made to the technique?

8. How does the gradient estimator used for DFL training relate to the REINFORCE algorithm in policy gradient reinforcement learning? What other gradient estimators could be explored?  

9. What future research directions are highlighted around DFL for problems with uncertainty in constraints? What open challenges remain in this area?

10. How could the experimental analysis be extended to better understand differences between the DFL and stochastic programming approaches? What additional problem sets or evaluation metrics could reveal further insights?

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper studies a stochastic resource-constrained project scheduling problem with uncertain task durations. Historical realizations of the uncertain durations are available as scenarios. 
- Determining a robust initial schedule is challenging since wrongly estimated task durations can lead to infeasibilities. In practice, schedules are repaired when uncertainties are revealed.
- Existing approaches like stochastic programming have limitations in scalability and modeling flexibility for repairs. 

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes using decision-focused learning (DFL) to learn to make scheduling decisions that minimize a post-hoc regret measure. 
- DFL embeds the scheduling optimization model within a training procedure. A stochastic estimator is used to enable gradient-based learning.
- The method adapts an existing DFL approach based on stochastic smoothing to handle uncertainty in constraints and non-differentiability.  

Contributions
- First application of DFL to a repairable stochastic scheduling problem with uncertainty in constraints.
- Demonstrates how an existing DFL technique can be adapted to serve this problem.
- Includes extensive experiments comparing DFL to stochastic programming and a deterministic approach.
- Shows DFL scales better than stochastic programming in terms of optimality gap.
- Highlights flexibility of DFL in modeling different repair strategies.

The paper makes an important contribution in exploring DFL for scheduling under uncertainty in constraints. The results demonstrate the potential of DFL as an alternative to stochastic programming for such problems.
