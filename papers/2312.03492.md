# [Learning From Scenarios for Stochastic Repairable Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03492)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using decision-focused learning (DFL) for a stochastic resource-constrained project scheduling problem where task durations are uncertain. The authors apply an existing DFL technique based on stochastic smoothing to handle the non-differentiability of the optimization problem. They introduce a post-hoc regret loss that accounts for the need to repair an initial schedule when uncertain task durations are revealed. Through experiments on project scheduling benchmark instances, they compare the DFL approach to using deterministic averages and a stochastic programming formulation. The results demonstrate that DFL scales better than stochastic programming and performs significantly better on larger problem instances. Overall, the paper shows promise for using DFL in scheduling applications with uncertainty in constraints, rather than just objectives. It also highlights DFL's flexibility in modeling different repair strategies compared to the limitations of stochastic programming approaches. Key future work includes incorporating feature data and testing alternative gradient estimators from reinforcement learning.
