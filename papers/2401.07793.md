# [Flexibly Scaling Large Language Models Contexts Through Extensible   Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) need sufficient context to handle critical applications like retrieval-augmented generation and few-shot learning.  
- However, due to constrained window size, LLMs can only access limited context. 
- Extending context by fine-tuning substantially increases training and inference costs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Extensible Tokenization" to realize flexible scaling of LLMs' contexts without fine-tuning the original LLM.  
- It is a middleware between tokenized context and LLM that transforms raw token embeddings into more compact "extensible embeddings" that encode more information.
- An additional language model is used as the extensible tokenizer to generate the extensible embeddings.
- The embeddings are learned via auto-regression by predicting next tokens based on preceding extensible embeddings from context. 
- Two-stream processing optimizes training sample efficiency.

Key Features:
- Flexibility - Scaling factor can be freely set at inference time to enable flexible extension of diverse context lengths.
- Compatibility - Can plug-and-play with downstream LLM and its fine-tuned models without compromising performance.
- Efficiency - Stream processing enables linear time complexity and reduced memory usage.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel concept of "extensible embeddings" and Extensible Tokenization to scale LLMs' context capacities.
- Achieves superior performance on long-context language modeling and understanding without expensive fine-tuning. 
- Realizes flexible scaling that generalizes to diverse context lengths at inference time.
- High compatibility as a drop-in module for LLMs and fine-tuned models. 
- More efficient stream processing that reduces time and memory costs.

In summary, the paper presents Extensible Tokenization as an effective, efficient, and flexible middleware solution to extend LLMs' contexts and scale their capacities without negative impacts on the original models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Extensible Tokenization, a method that compresses raw token embeddings into more compact yet equally informative representations called extensible embeddings, enabling large language models to perceive more contextual information within the same context window for flexible and efficient extension of context length.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Extensible Tokenization as a new method to extend the context length of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- Extensible Tokenization compresses the raw token embeddings into more compact but equally informative "extensible embeddings", allowing the LLM to perceive more contextual information within the same context window. 

- It is a flexible method where the scaling factor can be adjusted at inference time to realize diverse context length extensions. 

- It is introduced as a plug-and-play module compatible with both the downstream LLM it's trained on and many of its fine-tuned derivatives.

- Comprehensive experiments verify Extensible Tokenization as an effective, efficient, flexible and compatible approach to extending an LLM's context for improved performance on long-context tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using a stand-alone extensible tokenizer to transform token embeddings into more compact extensible embeddings that allow the downstream LLM to leverage longer contexts, with flexibility and compatibility being important additional advantages of this method.

The paper proposes a method called "Extensible Tokenization" to extend the context length that large language models can handle. Key ideas include transforming the raw token embeddings into more compact "extensible embeddings" that convey more contextual information, using a two-stream auto-regressive training approach to learn the embeddings, and providing flexibility to extend diverse context lengths through adjustable scaling factors.
