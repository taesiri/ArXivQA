# [VideoBooth: Diffusion-based Video Generation with Image Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "VideoBooth: Diffusion-based Video Generation with Image Prompts":

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the task of generating videos conditioned on both text prompts and image prompts. Text prompts alone are often not expressive enough to depict the desired visual details of objects in the generated video. Using additional image prompts that specify the appearance of subjects provides more accurate control over video generation. However, existing methods either require finetuning the model weights with multiple reference images or cannot handle the more challenging video generation task well.

Proposed Method: 
The paper proposes VideoBooth, a feed-forward framework to generate videos with subjects specified by the image prompts without any finetuning. It has two key designs:

1) Coarse-to-fine visual embedding of the image prompts. A pretrained image encoder provides coarse high-level visual features. An attention injection module further encodes multi-scale details by appending image features as additional keys and values to different cross-frame attention layers. 

2) Coarse-to-fine training strategy. The image encoder is trained first to provide a basic capability of generating videos with the target subject. Then the attention injection module is trained to refine details in a layer-wise manner.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel task of generating videos with image-specified subjects and establishes a dataset to support this.

- Designs a feed-forward video generation framework VideoBooth that effectively utilizes image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner without needing finetuning.

- Achieves superior image alignment performance and video quality compared to adapted baseline methods. VideoBooth generates more consistent and customized video content as specified by the image prompts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VideoBooth, a feed-forward framework to generate videos with subjects specified in image prompts by embedding the image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner using an image encoder and attention injection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a new task of video generation using image prompts without finetuning at inference time. They also introduce a dedicated dataset called VideoBooth to support this task.

2) They propose a VideoBooth framework with two key components: a) Coarse visual embeddings via image encoder, and b) Fine visual embeddings via attention injection. These two components work in a coarse-to-fine manner to accurately capture the visual details from the image prompts. 

3) The attention injection module uses multi-scale image prompts with spatial information to refine the details in the generated videos and maintain temporal consistency.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed VideoBooth framework for generating consistent and customized videos with subjects specified by the image prompts, without needing finetuning at inference time. The key ideas are the coarse-to-fine visual embedding strategy and the attention injection method for detail refinement and propagation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Video generation with image prompts - The main task studied in the paper is generating videos conditioned on an image prompt and a text prompt. The image prompt specifies the visual appearance of the subject.

- Coarse-to-fine visual embedding - A strategy proposed in the paper where visual information from the image prompt is embedded at two levels: (1) Coarse visual embeddings from an image encoder and (2) Fine visual embeddings from attention injection.

- Attention injection - One of the main technical contributions, where the image prompt is injected into the cross-frame attention modules of the text-to-video model as additional keys/values to refine details. 

- Temporal consistency - An important consideration in video generation models. The paper aims to maintain temporal consistency in the generated videos containing subjects specified by the image prompts.

- Feed-forward generation - The proposed VideoBooth model can generate videos with a feed-forward pass without needing per-video fine-tuning.

- VideoBooth dataset - A new dataset constructed by the authors based on WebVid to support this task, containing text prompts, video clips, and segmented image prompts from video frames.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine training strategy for the image encoder and attention injection modules. Can you explain in more detail why unified training degrades performance and necessitates this strategy? 

2. Attention injection uses multi-scale features from the image prompt as additional keys and values in cross-frame attention. How is the selection of scales decided and how does this impact refinement of details?

3. What modifications were made to the base video diffusion model architecture to accommodate the proposed visual embedding strategies?

4. The paper claims the proposed method is generalizable to diverse image prompts. What evidence supports this claim and what are limitations?  

5. How exactly does attention injection help propagate visual details from the first frame to subsequent frames for temporal consistency?

6. Could you explain the motivation behind using separate key/value projections for image prompt features versus frame features in attention injection?

7. What tradeoffs exist between coarse versus fine-grained visual embeddings in terms of quality versus computational efficiency? 

8. How suitable is the current framework for long video generation or does attention propagation start to degrade quality after a certain number of steps?

9. The qualitative results primarily show single prominent objects as image prompts. How does performance vary for more complex image prompts with multiple main subjects?

10. The paper uses WebVid dataset based prompts. How does the choice of underlying video dataset impact results and ability for the method to generalize?
