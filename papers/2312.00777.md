# [VideoBooth: Diffusion-based Video Generation with Image Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00777)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VideoBooth, a novel framework for generating videos conditioned on both text prompts and image prompts specifying the visual appearance of subjects. VideoBooth incorporates the image prompts at both coarse and fine levels - using an image encoder to extract global features that are fused into the text embeddings, as well as multi-scale attention injection to refine details. A dedicated VideoBooth dataset based on WebVid is introduced to support this new task. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoBooth’s state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing visually-customized, temporally-coherent videos in a feedforward manner at test time. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of critical components like coarse-to-fine training strategy. Qualitative results showcase VideoBooth’s ability to faithfully transfer visual attributes from image prompts while aligning well with text prompts. The proposed research tackles an underexplored but impactful direction - personalized video generation using image prompts, with immense potential for customizable content creation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a feed-forward framework VideoBooth to generate videos with subjects specified in image prompts, through coarse-to-fine visual embedding of the image prompts into a pretrained text-to-video model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a new framework called VideoBooth for the task of video generation using image prompts and text prompts. This is a novel and challenging task that has not been explored before. 

2) They introduce a new coarse-to-fine visual embedding strategy with two key components: an image encoder that provides coarse visual embeddings of the image prompts, and an attention injection module that refines details via fine visual embeddings.

3) They propose a novel attention injection method where multi-scale image prompts with spatial details are used to refine the generated video details. 

4) They establish a dedicated VideoBooth dataset to support research on this new task, consisting of image-text pairs with corresponding videos.

5) Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of VideoBooth in generating high-quality, customized videos containing subjects specified by the image prompts. The model is feed-forward and tuning-free during inference.

In summary, the key innovation is the VideoBooth framework and attention injection method for conditional video generation using image prompts, enabled by the new VideoBooth dataset.

The paper proposes a feed-forward framework called VideoBooth for video generation using image and text prompts. It uses a coarse-to-fine visual embedding strategy with an image encoder for coarse embeddings and an attention injection module for fine embeddings. The goal is to generate consistent videos that contain subjects specified in the image prompts, without needing to fine-tune the model at inference time. Key ideas include propagating visual cues from image prompts using cross-frame attentions and maintaining temporal consistency across frames.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes both a coarse visual embedding and a fine visual embedding for incorporating the image prompts. What is the motivation behind using two different embedding strategies instead of just one? How do these two embedding strategies complement each other?

2) Attention injection is used to obtain the fine visual embeddings by injecting the image prompts into the cross-frame attention modules. Why is attention injection preferred over simply concatenating image features to the input? How does attention help propagate visual details temporally? 

3) Different cross-frame attention layers receive the image prompt features at different scales. What is the rationale behind using a multi-scale representation instead of just feeding the highest resolution features?

4) The paper mentions training the coarse embeddings first, followed by the fine embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner. Why is this two-stage training approach better than joint end-to-end training? Provide hypotheses.

5) The ablation study shows that having only fine embeddings results in distorted motions over time. Explain the potential reasons why temporal consistency gets disrupted in this setting.

6) For the ablation with only coarse embeddings, what causes the model to fail at capturing all visual details from the image prompt? Does this indicate limitations of the coarse embedding approach?

7) How suitable is the current VideoBooth framework for generating complex video scenes? What enhancements could make the framework applicable to more complex, multi-subject scenarios? 

8) The image prompts in this work are automatically extracted from the first frame. How could providing manual image prompts for the desired subject potentially improve results further?

9) Besides diffusion models, how could the ideas in VideoBooth be adapted to other video generation architectures like GANs and autoregressive models? What modifications would be required?

10) The paper uses a video dataset with watermarks. How does the additional watermark removal module aid in improving visual quality? Does it provide any other benefits?
