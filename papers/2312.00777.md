## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "VideoBooth: Diffusion-based Video Generation with Image Prompts":

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the task of generating videos conditioned on both text prompts and image prompts. Text prompts alone are often not expressive enough to depict the desired visual details of objects in the generated video. Using additional image prompts that specify the appearance of subjects provides more accurate control over video generation. However, existing methods either require finetuning the model weights with multiple reference images or cannot handle the more challenging video generation task well.

Proposed Method: 
The paper proposes VideoBooth, a feed-forward framework to generate videos with subjects specified by the image prompts without any finetuning. It has two key designs:

1) Coarse-to-fine visual embedding of the image prompts. A pretrained image encoder provides coarse high-level visual features. An attention injection module further encodes multi-scale details by appending image features as additional keys and values to different cross-frame attention layers. 

2) Coarse-to-fine training strategy. The image encoder is trained first to provide a basic capability of generating videos with the target subject. Then the attention injection module is trained to refine details in a layer-wise manner.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel task of generating videos with image-specified subjects and establishes a dataset to support this.

- Designs a feed-forward video generation framework VideoBooth that effectively utilizes image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner without needing finetuning.

- Achieves superior image alignment performance and video quality compared to adapted baseline methods. VideoBooth generates more consistent and customized video content as specified by the image prompts.
