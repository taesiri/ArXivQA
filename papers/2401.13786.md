# [FoVA-Depth: Field-of-View Agnostic Depth Estimation for Cross-Dataset   Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras like fisheye and 360-degree equirectangular projection (ERP) cameras efficiently capture larger portions of a scene compared to pinhole cameras. 
- Estimating depth from multiple such wide FoV images has applications in robotics and automotive. 
- However, most available ground truth depth data is for small FoV pinhole cameras, making it hard to train depth estimation models for wide FoV cameras.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose the first method to train a stereo depth network on abundant small FoV data and generalize it to large FoV fisheye and ERP test data.
- Key idea: Warp training data to a common large FoV representation (e.g. ERP, cubemap). Augment it via "extrinsic rotation augmentation" to span all regions of the canonical view, forcing the network to learn about distortion.
- Adapt sphere sweeping stereo framework to use large FoV representations. Introduce specialized convolution operators for cubemap (CubeConv) and ERP (CircConv) to handle distortions and discontinuities.

Main Contributions:
- Generalized framework for multi-view stereo that works for any generalized central camera images
- Extrinsic rotation augmentation strategy that enables training on pinhole images and inference on arbitrary FoV cameras
- Modifications to convolution operations for applying neural networks to ERP and cubemap representations in an MVS pipeline
- Demonstrated improved cross-dataset generalization for indoor (ScanNet to Matterport360) and outdoor (DDAD to KITTI-360) scenarios

The key insight is that augmenting pinhole training data during training can teach the network robustness to handle distortions from other FoV cameras at test time. The specialized convolutions also help handle distortions and discontinuities better.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to train a stereo depth estimation model on abundant small field-of-view pinhole camera datasets and generalize it to large field-of-view fisheye and equirectangular images by warping training data to a canonical representation and augmenting it to handle diverse distortion types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method to train a stereo depth estimation model on widely available small field-of-view (FoV) pinhole camera data, and generalize it to larger FoV data such as fisheye and 360 equirectangular images at test time. The key ideas include:

1) Warping the training data to a canonical large FoV representation like cubemap or equirectangular projection (ERP).

2) Introducing a simple but effective data augmentation technique called Extrinsic Rotation Augmentation (ERA) during training. This forces the network to learn to handle the distortions from different FoV cameras.

3) Adapting the convolution operations like padding strategies for the cost regularization networks to work properly on cubemap and ERP representations.

4) Demonstrating improved cross-FoV generalization on both indoor (ScanNet to Matterport) and outdoor (DDAD to KITTI-360) datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is enabling training on readily available small FoV data while generalizing to large FoV images for depth estimation, which was not possible before with previous approaches. The simple yet effective ERA strategy is the key technique that enables the generalization ability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multi-view stereo (MVS): The task of estimating depth from multiple overlapping images.

- Generalized central camera (GCC): A model for cameras that captures rays arriving at a single center of projection point. Includes pinhole, fisheye, equirectangular, cubemap cameras. 

- Extrinsic rotation augmentation (ERA): A data augmentation strategy that rotates input images when mapping them to a canonical representation during training. Helps the model learn to handle distortion.

- Equirectangular projection (ERP): A spherical representation that allows capturing 360 degree views. The method adapts convolutions on ERP images.

- Cubemap: A 3D cube representation consisting of 6 square faces. The method introduces cube convolutions to handle continuity between cube faces.

- Cross-dataset generalization: Key goal of the method to train on small field-of-view datasets and generalize to large field-of-view datasets at test time.

- Indoor and outdoor experiments: Evaluate generalization from ScanNet to Matterport360 (indoor), and from DDAD to KITTI-360 (outdoor).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes using extrinsic rotation augmentation (ERA) during training to enable generalization to novel camera models. How exactly does ERA help the network learn to handle distortion better? Could you explain the intuition behind this?

2) The paper evaluates ERP and cubemap as canonical representations. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each? When would you choose one over the other?

3) The paper argues that efficient interpolation is critical for constructing cost volumes. Explain why interpolation is necessary and discuss the interpolation strategies for ERP and cubemap. How do they enable efficient GPU implementation?

4) The paper introduces Circular Convolution (CircConv) and Cube Convolution (CubeConv) to handle padding for ERP and cubemap respectively. Walk through how these convolution operators work and why they are important.

5) How does the paper adapt the MVS pipeline, including cost volume construction and regularization, to work with ERP and cubemap representations? What modifications were necessary?

6) Reciprocal tangent sampling is proposed for selecting distance hypotheses. Explain the intuition behind this strategy and why it is more suitable than alternatives like inverse depth sampling.

7) The method trains on small-FoV datasets like ScanNet and generalizes to large-FoV datasets like Matterport and KITTI-360. Discuss what enables this cross-dataset generalization capability. 

8) The results show that the method works well even for ERP despite its distortion. Why does the ERA strategy mitigate the issues arising from distortion?

9) How does the framework and proposed approach generalize to other central camera models besides ERP and cubemap? What modifications would be necessary?

10) The method could be extended to leverage multi-scale processing or self-supervised techniques from other MVS methods. Discuss how these extensions could be realized under the proposed framework.
