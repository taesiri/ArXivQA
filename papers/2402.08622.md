# [NeRF Analogies: Example-Based Visual Attribute Transfer for NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08622)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NeRF Analogies: Example-Based Visual Attribute Transfer for NeRFs":

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) uniquely encode the relationship between 3D geometry and appearance of a scene. However, editing NeRFs is challenging as geometry and appearance are often entangled in a complex way.
- Prior work has focused on either editing shape or appearance separately, using text prompts that can be unintuitive. Transferring appearance between different geometries in a semantics-aware way remains an open challenge. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "NeRF analogies", which transfers the visual appearance from a source NeRF to a target 3D geometry in a meaningful way, such that the resulting NeRF retains the target shape but has an appearance analogous to the source.
- The key idea is to establish semantic correspondence between the target geometry and slices of the source NeRF using dense features from a pretrained vision transformer (DiNO-ViT). 
- Correspondences are formed by finding the maximal cosine similarity between DiNO descriptors of query points on the target and points sampled from renderings of the source.
- The paper shows that DiNO features capture semantics well and can be used to generalize image analogies to multiview-consistent 3D.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the concept of "NeRF analogies" for semantics-aware appearance transfer between different 3D geometries.
- An approach to lift 2D example-based editing techniques like image analogies to multiview-consistent neural radiance fields. 
- Comparisons to style transfer and image analogy baselines which are shown to be inferior in quantitative evaluation and user studies.
- Results on synthetic shapes as well as real captured scenes that produce analogies combining target geometry and source appearance.

In summary, the paper presents NeRF analogies as a way to explore the product space of 3D geometry and appearance for neural radiance fields. The use of transformer features is key to establishing meaningful semantic correspondence between different shapes.
