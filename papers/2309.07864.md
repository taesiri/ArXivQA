## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework for constructing large language model (LLM) based intelligent agents. The framework consists of three key components - a brain module, a perception module, and an action module. 

The brain module, which is primarily composed of a large pre-trained language model, serves as the control center of the agent. It is responsible for knowledge representation, memory, reasoning, planning, decision making, and other high-level cognitive functions. The perception module processes multimodal sensory inputs from the environment and converts them into representations understandable by the brain module. This enables the agent to have a broader perception ability beyond just text. Finally, the action module carries out actions and manipulation in the environment based on the decisions made by the brain module. It expands the agent's capabilities by allowing tool use and embodied actions. Together, these three modules empower the agent with comprehensive abilities for perception, cognition, and interactive actions. The paper provides an in-depth discussion and categorization of techniques related to each module. It also explores various applications of LLM-based agents in scenarios like task-oriented deployment, innovation-oriented deployment, human-agent interaction and agent societies. Overall, the proposed framework offers a systematic perspective for constructing more intelligent and capable AI agents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for few-shot text classification using prototypical networks. The key idea is to learn a metric space in which inputs are embedded close to other inputs from the same class. During training, the model learns embeddings for support examples from known classes. At test time, the distance from a test example to each class prototype (the mean of the support examples for that class) is computed. The predicted class is the one whose prototype is closest to the test example embedding. Specifically, the model uses a BERT encoder pretrained on language modeling as the embedding function. During few-shot training, the encoder is frozen and a linear classifier layer is trained on top using a prototypical loss function that optimizes the metric space. This allows the model to generalize to new classes not seen during training by computing distances to the class prototypes in the learned metric space.
