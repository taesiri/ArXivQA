# [Citizen Science and Machine Learning for Research and Nature   Conservation: The Case of Eurasian Lynx, Free-ranging Rodents and Insects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02906)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Scientists working in nature conservation and research rely on large volumes of image and video data from cameras and traps to study animal behaviors and populations. Manually analyzing this data is extremely time-consuming. 
- Engaging citizen scientists to help label and analyze the data can be challenging to sustain their interest and involvement. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use machine learning and convolutional neural networks to automate parts of the analysis workflow. Models can be pre-trained on existing tagged image datasets to provide preliminary labels (e.g. presence of an animal, species), which volunteers can then verify.
- Design engaging crowdsourcing tasks that provide intrinsic rewards to citizen scientists, such as access to educational materials and information on how their efforts contribute to conservation goals. This helps retain their interest.
- Feed verified labels back into model training to improve accuracy, especially for rare cases with limited training data (e.g. Eurasian lynx).

Main Contributions:
- Discussion of challenges for researchers in analyzing large volumes of image and video trap data.
- Proposed workflow to combine machine learning for automation with human-in-the-loop verification by engaged citizen scientists. 
- Concept of designing intrinsically motivating crowdsourcing tasks that provide educational rewards and convey the real-world impact to sustain involvement.
- Framework for iterative training of models using verified human labels, enabling accuracy gains for rare classification cases.

In summary, the paper offers solutions to leverage both AI and engaged crowdsourcing to help researchers efficiently process and gain insights from the growing amounts of visual monitoring data essential for advancing nature conservation efforts.
