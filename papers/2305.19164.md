# [LANCE: Stress-testing Visual Models by Generating Language-guided   Counterfactual Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19164)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be:How can we automatically generate challenging and realistic counterfactual examples to systematically stress-test visual recognition models?The paper proposes an approach called LANCE (Language-guided Counterfactual Examples) to address this question. The key ideas are:- Use language as a discrete intermediate representation to perform targeted interventions on images. Perturbing text is easier than perturbing pixels directly.- Leverage recent advances in language models and image generation models to edit image captions and generate corresponding counterfactual images.- Benchmark models on counterfactual test suites to quantify drops in performance and sensitivity to different types of edits (e.g. changing object, background, etc).- Discover class-specific failure modes and biases by analyzing model performance on tailored counterfactual examples.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that language-guided counterfactual image generation can serve as an automated way to stress-test vision models by creating challenging and realistic example sets that standard IID test sets lack. The paper aims to demonstrate this methodology and its applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes an automated method called LANCE to generate language-guided counterfactual images to stress test visual models. The key contributions are:- It uses language as a discrete scaffold to generate targeted interventions on images by editing the image captions. This allows generating a diverse range of realistic and challenging counterfactual examples.- It combines recent advances in language modeling for text editing and image editing with text-to-image models to generate counterfactual images conditioned on the original image and edited caption.- It benchmarks a diverse set of ImageNet pretrained models on the generated counterfactual test sets and shows they lead to significant and consistent performance drops compared to baseline approaches.- It demonstrates applications like comparing model sensitivity across different types of edits, and surfacing class-level model biases in ImageNet models.- It provides an open-source toolkit to facilitate robust testing and benchmarking of visual models using counterfactual evaluation.In summary, the main contribution is an automated and extensible method to stress-test visual models by generating targeted counterfactual images using language guidance, without needing additional human supervision or changing the model weights. The results validate its ability to surface unknown weaknesses and biases in existing models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an automated method called LANCE that stress-tests visual models by generating challenging but realistic counterfactual images using recent progress in language modeling and image generation, and demonstrates its ability to reveal model biases and performance drops across diverse pretrained models.
