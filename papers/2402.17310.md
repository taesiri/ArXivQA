# [Method of Tracking and Analysis of Fluorescent-Labeled Cells Using   Automatic Thresholding and Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- High-throughput screening of pharmaceutical drug candidates requires efficient analysis of cell images, but existing methods have limitations:
  - Image processing methods cannot track correspondence of cells across images
  - AI methods require large amounts of training data for new cell types

Proposed Solution:
- Developed a method to efficiently track cells across video frames and quantitatively measure signal ratios between cell components using automatic thresholding and labeling

Methods:
- Detect cell nuclei by binarizing based on automatically determined threshold, applying morphological operations, and labeling
- Track nuclei across frames by comparing centroid and bounding box positions 
- Measure signal ratios between nuclei and cytoplasm using tracked cell data and masks
- Tested effect of morphological operations on tracking performance

Key Contributions:
- Proposed a cell tracking and analysis method that does not require retraining for new cell types
- Showed the method can track ~60% of cells, enough to quantify nuclear localization  
- Determined optimal parameters for morphological operations to balance noise removal and prevention of nucleus contour deformation
- Established new immortalized cell line expressing fluorescent tagged proteins to evaluate method

In summary, the key novelty of this work is an efficient cell tracking and analysis approach that uses image processing techniques like thresholding and labeling to avoid issues with training data dependence faced by AI methods. The experiments demonstrate satisfactory performance on a newly engineered fluorescent cell line without additional training data.
