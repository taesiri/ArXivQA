# [VideoMAE V2: Scaling Video Masked Autoencoders with Dual Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16727)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to scale video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) to build powerful and general video foundation models. Specifically, the paper focuses on scaling VideoMAE in both model size (to billion-level parameters) and pre-training data (to million-level videos). The key hypothesis is that by properly addressing the challenges in scaling computation, data, and model adaptation, they can train the first billion-level video transformer with VideoMAE pre-training, and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability on a variety of downstream video tasks.

Some key aspects of their investigation include:

- Proposing a dual masking strategy to improve training efficiency of large VideoMAE models.

- Building a large-scale diverse video dataset by mixing multiple sources for pre-training. 

- Studying progressive training schemes to adapt the billion-level pre-trained model to different downstream tasks.

By addressing these challenges, the paper shows VideoMAE is highly scalable and can produce powerful and generalizable video foundation models when trained at billion-scale with million-level unlabeled videos. The effectiveness is demonstrated by state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks including classification, detection and temporal localization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They present an efficient framework VideoMAE V2 to scale video masked autoencoders to billion-level models on million-level unlabeled video data. 

2. They propose a dual masking strategy for VideoMAE that masks both the encoder and decoder to improve pre-training efficiency. This allows scaling to larger models and datasets.

3. They use a progressive training paradigm with an initial pre-training on diverse unlabeled data, followed by post-pre-training on a labeled dataset. 

4. They successfully train a video vision transformer (ViT) with over 1 billion parameters, which is the first billion-level video transformer.

5. Their billion-parameter VideoMAE V2 model achieves new state-of-the-art results on major video understanding benchmarks like Kinetics, Something-Something, AVA, THUMOS14 etc.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an efficient and scalable framework to pre-train billion-parameter video masked autoencoders. The proposed techniques like dual masking and progressive training enable scaling to huge models and datasets, leading to SOTA results on various downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents VideoMAE V2, a scaled up version of VideoMAE that uses a dual masking strategy and trains on large unlabeled and labeled video datasets to learn powerful billion-parameter video foundation models. The key results are state-of-the-art performance on multiple video understanding tasks including action recognition, detection and localization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in video masked autoencoding:

- It scales video masked autoencoding to much larger models and datasets than prior works like VideoMAE, MAE-ST, and BEVT. This is the first work to train a billion-parameter video Transformer with masked autoencoding. 

- It proposes a novel dual masking strategy to improve training efficiency and enable scaling to billion-parameter models. Masking both the encoder and decoder based on different strategies is a new idea.

- It shows strong transfer performance to a wide variety of downstream tasks including classification, detection, and temporal localization. This demonstrates the versatility of large masked autoencoded models as general video foundation models. 

- It adopts a progressive training approach involving a massive unlabeled pre-training dataset and then a labeled intermediate fine-tuning dataset before final task training. This bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream data.

- The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art across many datasets like Kinetics, Something-Something, and AVA. The gains over prior arts are much more substantial than typical incremental improvements.

Overall, this work makes breakthroughs in scaling video masked autoencoders in terms of model size, data size, training techniques, transfer tasks, and performance. The dual masking strategy and progressive training approach are innovative ideas not explored before for video. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of masked autoencoding as a general paradigm for learning powerful video foundation models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Scaling up VideoMAE pre-training to even larger models and datasets. The authors note that their billion-parameter model is trained on 1.35M videos, which is still much smaller than image and language models. They suggest exploring ways to train VideoMAE on billions of videos to further improve performance.

- Developing more efficient video pre-training frameworks to enable scaling. The dual masking strategy improves efficiency, but the authors note there is still room for improvement to support billion-level model pre-training on large datasets with limited compute.

- Exploring different transfer learning techniques to effectively adapt the large pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The authors used progressive training, but suggest investigating other techniques like prompt tuning.

- Testing VideoMAE representations on a broader range of video tasks beyond just action classification/detection. The authors demonstrate strong performance on several tasks, but note the models could likely transfer to many other video domains.

- Compressing the billion-parameter models into smaller and more efficient models. The authors show some initial distillation results, but suggest more work on model compression.

- Developing video foundation models with modalities beyond just vision, such as audio and text. The authors note recent image/text foundation models, suggesting extending VideoMAE to multimodal pre-training.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling VideoMAE to even larger models and datasets, improving training efficiency, transferring to more tasks, model compression, and incorporating multimodal information. The authors position VideoMAE as an initial step towards powerful video foundation models.
