# [Differentiable Visual Computing for Inverse Problems and Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Differentiable Visual Computing for Inverse Problems and Machine Learning":

Problem: 
Modern computer graphics techniques can realistically simulate the appearance and dynamics of real-world environments. However, these methods operate in a "forward" direction - synthesizing outputs given inputs. Differentiable methods instead aim to understand how outputs change when inputs or environment parameters change. This can be useful for solving difficult inverse problems in areas like physics inference, optimal control, computer vision, design, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. However, modeling real-world phenomena differentiably while remaining accurate and useful is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a unified "differentiable visual computing" (DVC) pipeline combining differentiable geometry, animation/physics, and rendering. This allows gradient-based optimization of graphics outputs with respect to scene parameters. Analytical and learned models are combined for accuracy and adaptability. The paper reviews state-of-the-art techniques in making each part of the graphics pipeline differentiable, including:

Geometry: Converting discrete representations to continuous, smoothing geometry outputs, and learning continuous operators. Used in reconstruction, design optimization, robot morphology optimization.

Animation/Physics: Analytical "explicit" and learned models to simulate dynamics and derive gradients. Used in system ID, control learning, computational design, fluid dynamics. Handles issues like vanishing gradients.

Rendering: Estimating image gradients w.r.t scene geometry, materials, lighting, camera. Used in inverse graphics problems. Combines theoretical models and neural scene representations.

Contributions:
- Presents vision for complete differentiable VC pipeline with gradients from rendered images back to scene parameters
- Reviews and relates techniques making each VC stage differentiable 
- Discusses integration of analytical and learned models, using DL for unmodeled phenomena
- Applications in physical inference, optimal control, vision, design, manufacturing, autonomous systems
- Identifies research frontiers like more efficient gradients, software infrastructure, combining exploration and optimization

The paper argues differentiable VC can significantly improve data efficiency, speed, and accuracy of machine learning for real-world physical systems by constraining it to the boundaries of physical reality.
