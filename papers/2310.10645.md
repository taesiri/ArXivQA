# [Interactive Task Planning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10645)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing an interactive robot framework that can accomplish long-horizon task planning and generalize to new goals or tasks, even during execution. The key hypothesis seems to be that by combining large language models for high-level planning and low-level execution, along with converting robot skills into a functional API, they can create a system that can flexibly plan and adapt to new user requests and tasks. The central capabilities they aim to demonstrate are:

1) The ability to generate novel executable plans from limited examples/guidelines, showing adaptability to new goals. 

2) Leveraging LLMs' few-shot learning capabilities to generalize planning from basic recipes/guidelines.

3) Allowing the system to replan and incorporate user feedback throughout execution via natural language interaction.

4) Easy adaptation to entirely new tasks by simply modifying the task guidelines and skill API, without needing additional training or complex prompt engineering.

Overall, the key research focus seems to be on developing and experimentally validating an interactive robotic system that can leverage large language models for flexible planning, replanning, and execution across different tasks. The core hypothesis is that their proposed framework can achieve these capabilities in a simple and effective way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposes ITP, a novel training-free robotic system for interactive task planning with language models. ITP uses large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for both high-level planning and low-level execution of robot skills.

- Shows that ITP can generate executable plans from limited guidelines, demonstrating its adaptability. For example, it can generate plans for making new drinks not included in the original guidelines, like taro milk or matcha milk.

- Converts robot skills into a functional API that GPT-4 can leverage, enabling natural language direction rather than code prompts. This removes the need for complex code prompt engineering.

- Shows that ITP can replan dynamically based on new user requests during task execution, taking into account completed steps, guidelines, and history. This allows real-time human-in-the-loop feedback.

- Demonstrates ITP's simplicity in adapting to new tasks like dishwashing by just changing the task guidelines and skills API. Does not require retraining models or heavy prompt engineering.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing ITP as a novel, simple framework for interactive task planning on real robots using LLMs. ITP is training-free, leverages natural language, and is adaptive to new goals and tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes an interactive robot framework called ITP that uses large language models like GPT-4 for task planning and execution. The key idea is to have a high-level planner generate step-by-step instructions using natural language, which are then executed by a lower-level module that converts robot skills into functional APIs that the language model can call directly. The system can replan based on new user requests and has been demonstrated to work for drink-making and dishwashing tasks.

In short, ITP enables interactive task planning for robots using large language models, without needing complex prompt engineering or pretraining.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in interactive task planning for robots:

- The approach is fairly unique in using large language models like GPT for both high-level planning and low-level execution. Many other methods rely more heavily on traditional symbolic planning techniques. Using LLMs provides more flexibility and natural language interaction.

- Compared to prior LLM methods like SayCan, Code as Policies, etc., this paper does not require additional pretrained components like value functions or policy networks. The prompting approach allows leveraging the capabilities of LLMs more directly.

- A key contribution is the simple framework and modular architecture that makes it easy to adapt the system to new tasks just by modifying the task guidelines and skill documentation. This contrasts with methods that require heavy prompt engineering or training task-specific models.

- The focus on real-time human-in-the-loop interaction and replanning based on new user requests is less explored in prior LLM robotics systems. The ability to fluidly incorporate feedback and modify plans accordingly is an important capability.

- While results are demonstrated on real robots, the tasks are still somewhat simplified compared to more complex manipulation or navigation tasks tackled in simulation by some other works. Testing the limits of this approach on more intricate real-world tasks remains future work. 

- The vision system for visual scene understanding is basic compared to some more sophisticated techniques leveraged in related work. Integrating more advanced vision capabilities could further improve the system.

Overall, the simple yet effective framework, ease of generalization, and human interaction capabilities seem to be the key strengths of this approach compared to prior efforts aiming to utilize LLMs for robot planning and control. The demonstrations indicate promising potential, especially for practical real-world interactive robots.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Enhancing the capabilities of the robot skills to tackle more intricate tasks. The current system provides a proof of concept using relatively simple robot skills for drink making. Developing more advanced skills could expand the range of tasks the system can perform.

- Integrating more precise visual information and 3D understanding. The current system uses 2D bounding boxes from Grounded-DINO to locate objects. Incorporating richer visual perception with depth information could significantly improve the robot's ability to understand and interact with its environment. 

- Exploring how other powerful models can be integrated to further advance real-world robotics. The authors propose their system as a starting point that could stimulate more research on harnessing state-of-the-art AI models like LLMs for interactive robotics.

- Considering safety and robustness. As the system involves real-world interaction, ensuring safety and reliable performance will be critical for real-world deployment. Formal verification or learning from human oversight could help address these challenges.

- Benchmarking on more complex tasks. Testing the system on more intricate real-world tasks beyond drink making could better characterize its capabilities and limitations. Measurement against standardized benchmarks could allow more systematic evaluation.

- Incorporating semantic representations. While the current system uses natural language, integrating more structured semantic representations could potentially improve generalization and interpretability.

- Exploring lifelong/continual learning. Enabling the system to cumulatively learn and expand its skills over time through interaction could enhance its applicability for personal robots.

In summary, the authors propose their system as a starting point and suggest numerous promising research avenues along dimensions like perception, planning, control, safety, generalization, and human interaction. Advancing these areas could lead to more capable real-world interactive robots.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Interactive Task Planning (ITP), a framework that enables robots to accomplish long-horizon task planning and easily generalize to new goals or tasks using language models. ITP has two main components - a high level planner that generates a step-by-step plan from a user request and task guidelines, and a low level executor that executes each step using predefined robot skills. ITP allows the robot to replan when the user provides new requests during execution, taking into account completed steps, guidelines, and the new request. The authors embody ITP on a real-world drink making robot and demonstrate its ability to generate plans for novel drinks not seen in the guidelines as well as replan when the user changes their request mid-execution. They also show ITP can easily generalize to new tasks like dishwashing simply by modifying the task guidelines. The simplicity and strong performance of ITP on robotic planning and replanning highlights the potential of language models for interactive robot systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Interactive Task Planning with Language Models (ITP), a framework that enables robots to accomplish long-horizon task planning and easily adapt to new goals or tasks through natural language interaction. The key components of ITP are 1) a vision module that grounds visual inputs into language descriptions, 2) language models for high-level planning and low-level execution, and 3) robot skill APIs that allow the language models to control the robot. 

ITP uses GPT-4 to generate high-level plans based on user requests and task guidelines specified in natural language. Each high-level step is then executed by having GPT-4 call the appropriate robot skills through the API. ITP can replan new steps if the user provides updated preferences mid-execution. Experiments on a real robot making customized drinks show ITP can accurately plan novel recipes not seen in the guidelines. ITP also exhibits strong generalization by adapting to a dishwashing task with only minor changes to the guidelines and skills API. The authors demonstrate a practical system for interactive robot planning that capitalizes on recent advances in language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Interactive Task Planning with Language Models":

The paper proposes a framework called ITP (Interactive Task Planning) that uses large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to accomplish interactive robot task planning and execution. ITP has two main components - a high level planner LLM that takes a prompt specifying the task, task guidelines, and user request as input and outputs a step-by-step plan, and a low level executor LLM that executes each step by calling predefined robot skills through a functional API. The skills are translated into this functional API to enable the LLM's function calling capabilities. ITP also incorporates visual scene understanding through a vision-language model, and can replan on the fly based on new user requests during execution by considering the updated goal, previously completed steps, and task guidelines. This allows ITP to dynamically adapt its plan based on real-time human-in-the-loop feedback.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a framework for Interactive Task Planning (ITP) with Language Models for robots. The main problem it is trying to address is:

- How to accomplish long-horizon task planning in robots that can easily generalize to new goals or tasks, and adapt during execution based on user input. 

Most traditional robot planning methods require hand-designed modules and representations, making generalization difficult. Recent approaches using large language models can allow more open-ended planning, but often require heavy prompt engineering or domain-specific pretrained models.

The key questions/problems the paper seems to be addressing are:

- How to enable robots to do interactive task planning in an end-to-end manner using language models, without a lot of extra training or prompting.

- How to make the system generalizable to new tasks by simply providing new natural language task guidelines, rather than hand-designing modules.

- How to make the system adapt in real-time to new user requests and feedback throughout execution, by replanning accordingly.

To summarize, the main focus is on developing a simple yet effective framework for interactive robotic task planning that leverages the generalization and replanning abilities of large language models, while remaining easy to adapt to new tasks and user preferences.
