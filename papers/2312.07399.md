# [Large Language Models are Clinical Reasoners: Reasoning-Aware Diagnosis   Framework with Prompt-Generated Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07399)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a reasoning-aware diagnosis framework to address the lack of clinical reasoning in existing disease diagnosis models. The framework uses large language models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to generate free-text rationales explaining the reasoning behind a diagnosis prediction. Specifically, the LLM is prompted to produce a Clinical Chain-of-Thought (Clinical CoT) rationale that interprets patient data and guides the diagnosis. The framework is evaluated on an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis task using MRI scan descriptions and related patient data. Results show improved diagnosis accuracy when using the Clinical CoT rationales compared to standard prompting baselines. The LLM teacher model is then used to augment a dataset with generated rationales, which is utilized to train smaller student models via knowledge distillation, preserving much of the teacher’s reasoning ability while being more practical to deploy. Extensive analysis demonstrates the framework's ability to produce human-like clinical rationales. Finally, a novel set of criteria for evaluating machine-generated clinical rationales is proposed to facilitate future research in this direction. Overall, the paper establishes a strong foundation for enabling clinical reasoning in disease diagnosis models through large language models.
