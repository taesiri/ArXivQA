# [Multi-Party Chat: Conversational Agents in Group Settings with Humans   and Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13835)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop conversational AI agents that can engage in coherent, multi-party conversations. Specifically, the paper focuses on two main challenges:1. Turn-taking - Deciding when an agent should speak up in a multi-party setting.2. Utterance coherence - Generating appropriate responses that take into account the dialogue history from multiple participants. The authors collected a new dataset called MultiLIGHT to train and evaluate models on these skills in multi-party chat settings with 3 participants. They compared several approaches, including training separate models for turn-taking and response generation. The key findings were:- Models trained on the MultiLIGHT dataset showed significant improvements in multi-party response quality compared to baseline models trained only on two-party dialogues. - For turn-taking, a speaker-only model performed best at predicting the next speaker.- For response generation, an utterance-only model fine-tuned on MultiLIGHT performed best at producing coherent, relevant, consistent responses grounded in the full context.- In human evaluations, their best model combining the speaker and utterance models showed substantial improvements over a baseline model in consistency, lack of contradictions, identity maintenance, and overall quality.So in summary, the main hypothesis was that multi-party training data and models tailored to the turn-taking and utterance challenges could improve over models designed for two-party dialogues. The results validated this hypothesis and identified effective approaches for the two sub-tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new dataset and models for multi-party conversational AI, where multiple speakers can converse together beyond just two participants. Specifically:- They collect a new dataset called MultiLIGHT of multi-party conversations between 3 crowdworkers roleplaying fantasy characters. This provides a resource for training and evaluating models on aspects like turn-taking and coherence in multi-party chat.- They study different model architectures for handling turn-taking and response generation in this setting. This includes models that jointly or separately handle when to speak and what to say. - They evaluate these models both automatically and via human evaluations. Their best model combines a speaker-only model for turn taking with a response generation model trained on their new MultiLIGHT dataset. - This model outperforms prior work and baselines on metrics like consistency, lack of contradictions, and identity maintenance when evaluated by humans conversing with the model.So in summary, the key contribution is providing a new dataset, models, and experiments analyzing the challenges of multi-party conversational AI, where they demonstrate improvements over standard models that are designed for two-party conversations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents a new dataset and methods for training AI agents to have coherent and engaging conversations in multi-party chat settings with multiple humans and AI agents. The key findings are that models require skills to determine when to talk and to maintain coherent personas across multiple speakers, which existing dialogue models lack. The newly collected dataset helps models significantly improve on these skills.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on multi-party chat and conversational AI:- The paper makes a valuable contribution by releasing a new multi-party conversational dataset called MultiLIGHT. As the authors note, there is a lack of large, high-quality datasets for training and evaluating models for multi-party chat. The MultiLIGHT dataset helps address this need.- The paper thoroughly evaluates different methods for two key challenges in multi-party chat - turn-taking and utterance coherence. By comparing approaches like speaker-only models vs speaker-and-utterance models, the authors provide useful insights into what techniques work best.- The paper demonstrates strong improvements over prior work by fine-tuning on the MultiLIGHT dataset. The best model outperforms baselines like BlenderBot and the state-of-the-art RELIC model on metrics like perplexity and human evaluations. This highlights the value of in-domain multi-party training data.- The paper builds on prior work from the authors on the Light dialog environment. The MultiLIGHT dataset represents an extension of the two-party Light and Light Wild datasets to a multi-party setting. The continuity allows for interesting comparisons of the same models on two-party vs multi-party dialog.- The paper focuses on open-domain dialog with fixed characters in fantasy role-playing games. Other recent work has explored multi-party dialog in more goal-oriented domains like negotiations or collaborative tasks. The open-ended nature of this work complements those efforts.- The paper adopts a similar experimental approach as some other conversational AI papers - train/evaluate on automatic metrics, then validate with human evaluations. The human studies confirm the value of multi-party fine-tuning demonstrated in the automatic metrics.Overall, by releasing a valuable new dataset and conducting extensive experiments, this paper makes an important contribution to the nascent field of multi-party conversational AI. The insights on turn-taking and coherence will be useful for other researchers looking to build effective multi-party chatbots.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Studying the value of a turn-taking model and the settings where strict turn-taking is important for improving conversation quality. The authors note that their dataset and setting may not strongly require exact turn order for an engaging conversation. Further research could investigate situations where turn order becomes more crucial.- Building additional benchmarks to evaluate performance on turn-taking in settings where it has a bigger impact on conversation quality. The current open-ended conversational setting may not require precise turn order, so more constrained tasks could better evaluate this. - Exploring other conversational domains beyond open-ended chats. The authors use a situated fantasy game setting which allows controlling personas and environment. Testing in other grounded domains could further analyze multi-party dialogue.- Considering the social impacts of training bots in multi-party settings, which is less studied than two-party conversations. Future work could look at how awareness of turn-taking can lead to more inclusive experiences.- Continuing to scale up multi-party training data and models. The authors' new dataset advances progress but larger datasets could further improve multi-party skills.- Studying other open challenges for multi-party bots like modeling social dynamics beyond turn-taking. The authors focus on two core skills but there are likely other social phenomena worth investigating.In summary, the main future directions center around expanding research into multi-party conversations by building more datasets and models, testing in further domains and tasks, and studying open social/conversational challenges beyond turn-taking.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new dataset called MultiLIGHT for training and evaluating conversational AI agents in multi-party chat settings with multiple speakers. The dataset contains over 10,000 conversations with 3 participants each, collected via crowdsourcing using the LIGHT text adventure game framework where participants take on character personas in fantasy locations. The authors study the challenges of turn-taking and coherence when extending conversational models to multi-party chat. They compare several methods on these tasks using perplexity, F1, and human evaluations. The best performing model utilizes a separate speaker prediction model for turn-taking and a transformer model trained on the MultiLIGHT dataset for utterance generation. This combined approach outperforms prior work on consistency, identity maintenance, lack of contradictions, and other metrics in human studies. The paper concludes that the new MultiLIGHT dataset enables improved multi-party conversational ability over models trained only on two-party dialogues.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new dataset and methods for training AI agents to participate in multi-party conversations. Previous dialogue research has mostly focused on two-party conversations between a single AI agent and a human user. This paper aims to study more realistic group chat settings with multiple speakers. The authors collect a new dataset called MultiLIGHT of human three-way conversations in fantasy RPG scenarios with assigned personas and settings. They train transformer language models on this data to handle two key challenges: deciding when to speak (turn-taking) and generating coherent utterances grounded in the full context. They compare models trained on the MultiLIGHT data to existing two-party dialogue models like BlenderBot. The MultiLIGHT-trained models significantly outperform prior work in human evaluations of consistency, lack of contradiction, and maintaining identity/persona. The paper demonstrates the value of multi-party training data and analysis for improving conversational AI in group chat settings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes and evaluates several approaches for training conversational AI agents to participate in multi-party chats, focusing on two key challenges - turn-taking and coherence. The main method used is to collect a new dataset called MultiLIGHT of 3-person chats in a fantasy role-playing game setting, where each person is assigned a character with a persona to roleplay. This dataset is used to train and evaluate transformer-based language models on their ability to control turn-taking and generate coherent responses in a multi-party setting.Four main approaches are explored: (1) A "silence or utterance" model that decides to be silent or generates an utterance for its character each turn. (2) A "speaker and utterance" model that predicts the next speaker and generates their utterance. (3) A "speaker only" model that just predicts the next speaker. (4) An "utterance only" model that is given the speaker and generates their utterance. Combinations of these approaches are evaluated on turn-taking accuracy and language modeling metrics. The best overall approach uses the speaker only model for turn-taking and the utterance only model for response generation, both trained on the new MultiLIGHT dataset. This combined approach is evaluated by humans and shown to outperform existing 2-party dialogue models on several metrics related to coherence, consistency and engagingness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of building conversational AI agents that can participate in multi-party chats. Specifically, it focuses on two main challenges:1. Turn-taking - Deciding when an AI agent should speak next in a conversation with multiple participants. This requires balancing when to talk versus remain silent.2. Utterance coherence - Generating appropriate and coherent responses that take into account the dialogue history from multiple participants. The model needs to distinguish between different speakers' states and characteristics.The paper collects a new dataset called MultiLIGHT of group conversations between 3 human participants. It then evaluates different techniques for training AI agents on this data to handle the challenges of turn-taking and coherence in multi-party chat. The goal is to develop models that can conduct more realistic conversations compared to existing work that focuses on turn-based, two-party dialogues.
