# [Continual Segmentation with Disentangled Objectness Learning and Class   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Continual semantic segmentation aims to learn new classes sequentially without forgetting past knowledge. However, existing methods follow a per-pixel classification paradigm which is inherently challenging for continual learning. This paper argues that query-based segmenters with built-in objectness have advantages for continual segmentation due to the transferability of objectness and resistance to forgetting of mask proposals.

Method: 
The paper proposes CoMasTRe, which disentangles continual segmentation into two stages - continual objectness learning and continual class recognition. It uses a two-stage segmenter by learning to propose class-agnostic masks first, then recognize them. In stage 1, positional queries are used to produce mask proposals and objectness scores. In stage 2, task queries and task-specific classifiers are introduced to specialize class knowledge and mitigate interference.

To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, CoMasTRe performs separate distillation for the two stages. For objectness, mask proposals, objectness scores and positional embeddings are distilled to reinforce old objectness. For classification, a multi-label distillation leverages high-objectness embeddings from past steps and matched embeddings from the current step.

Contributions:
- Proposes to disentangle continual segmentation into objectness learning and recognition to simplify the problem 
- Designs a two-stage Transformer-based segmenter and task components for interference reduction
- Performs separated distillation strategies tailored for objectness and classification to mitigate forgetting

Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and ADE20K datasets, with significant gains over prior methods. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of different components in CoMasTRe.
