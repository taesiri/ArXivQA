# [Chatbot is Not All You Need: Information-rich Prompting for More   Realistic Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating human-like conversations, but still face challenges in consistency, realism, and maintaining context. Specifically, (1) responses from LLMs mimicking fictional characters often lack stability, (2) LLMs struggle to maintain conversational memory due to context limits, and (3) few datasets provide helpful information to inform better prompt engineering.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a multi-pronged approach to address these challenges:

1. Information-Rich Prompting: Provide the LLM comprehensive info on the character including - attributes, physical/emotional states, memories and knowledge about the interlocutor. This additional context enables more realistic reactions from the LLM.  

2. Within-Prompt Self Memory Management: Summarize the chat history into the prompt to mitigate context length limits and help the LLM maintain conversational memory.

3. New Benchmark Dataset: Created the Dialogue-Emotion-Attributes-Relationship (DEAR) dataset by augmenting the Movie Dialog Corpus using GPT-3.5 Turbo to provide richer attribute and emotional information.

Key Contributions:  

1. Demonstrated the value of information-rich prompting techniques like providing sensory, emotional and memory context to enhance realism.

2. Introduced a structured approach for self memory management within prompts to maintain conversational context.  

3. Released the DEAR benchmark dataset containing comprehensive dialog information to facilitate research.

4. Showed combining different prompt information sources leads to better language model performance on the conversational task.

Overall, the paper makes valuable contributions around prompt engineering techniques to enhance LLM abilities for realistic and consistent dialog generation.
