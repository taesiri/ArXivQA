# [Tactile-Informed Action Primitives Mitigate Jamming in Dense Clutter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Navigating and retrieving objects in densely cluttered and constrained environments with movable objects is challenging for robots due to jamming against obstacles that inhibits progress. 
- Current approaches either avoid interaction with clutter or rely on iterative mechanical search which is time-consuming.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two action primitives - "burrowing" and "excavating" - that fluidize/disturb the scene to mitigate jamming and enable continued progress. 
- Burrowing adds lateral sinusoidal motions to create a snaking behavior that clears a path and perturbs objects. 
- Excavating performs a scooping, spiral motion that rotates and translates to push aside obstructing objects.
- Implement and test primitive motions in isolation using open loop control.
- Develop a closed loop hybrid control strategy that uses tactile sensing to decide when to trigger the primitives based on contact forces and locations.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate burrowing and excavating primitives successfully reduce likelihood of jamming in dense clutter, enabling up to 10x increase in success rate over baseline.
- Show primitives are robust to variations in key parameters for amplitude, frequency and duration.
- Introduce tactile-informed hybrid strategy that outperforms open loop deployment of primitives and reduces completion times.
- Validate approaches in simulation and experiments using sensorized hardware in a constrained, cluttered scene.

In summary, the key idea is using disturbance primitives informed by tactile sensing to mitigate object jamming and efficiently reach goals in dense, occluded spaces not conducive to mapping or planning. The hybrid control strategy and experiments demonstrate feasibility.
