# [DeepSet SimCLR: Self-supervised deep sets for improved pathology   representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for computer vision have shown great promise, but extending them to 3D medical images is computationally demanding. 
- Existing SSL approaches for 3D medical data use expensive 3D networks or transformers to model long-range dependencies. This limits their widespread use.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two SSL variants - Per-scan SimCLR (PS-SimCLR) and DeepSet SimCLR (DS-SimCLR) - that implicitly model the 3D nature of medical scans while adding little overhead to the SimCLR baseline.

- PS-SimCLR uses a novel sampling strategy to sample positive pair views from a contiguous region of a scan. This captures long-range dependencies while using a computationally cheap 2D CNN.

- DS-SimCLR treats each view as a set of slices from a scan region. The DeepSet architecture operates on the sets to aggregate information across slices. This also models 3D structure implicitly.

Main Contributions:
- Two computationally efficient variants of SimCLR that outperform baseline while modeling 3D context.
- Analysis of key hyperparameters like sampling width and set size.
- Extensive evaluation on downstream tasks showing improved transfer learning with the proposed variants.
- Focus on easy integrations of improvements to a SSL baseline, unlike prior works needing expensive 3D networks or transformers.

In summary, the main idea is to implicitly model the 3D nature of medical scans during SSL in a way that adds little overhead to a 2D SSL baseline. The methods proposed achieve this by simple data sampling strategies and use of DeepSet architecture.
