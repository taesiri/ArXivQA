# [Revisiting Vision Transformer from the View of Path Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06548)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we reinterpret Vision Transformers (ViTs) from a novel perspective as ensembles of multiple paths, and use this view to improve their performance?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) ViTs can be equivalently transformed into an ensemble of multiple paths with different lengths. 2) Viewing ViTs in this way allows manipulating and optimizing the paths to improve performance. Specifically:- Not all paths contribute equally or positively to the final prediction. Optimizing path combinations via pruning or reweighting can improve results.- Transferring knowledge between paths via self-distillation can enhance path representations and improve overall performance.So in summary, the paper proposes and validates a new interpretation of ViTs as path ensembles, and utilizes this view to develop techniques to optimize path combinations and representations for improved performance. The experiments aim to demonstrate the viability of this ensemble perspective and the benefits it can provide.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel view of Vision Transformers (ViTs) as an ensemble of multiple paths with different lengths, rather than as a traditional single-path network. The paper shows this view is mathematically equivalent to the standard formulation.2. Investigating the functionality of the different paths and finding that short paths do not benefit the final prediction. The paper proposes new strategies like path pruning and EnsembleScale to optimize the combination of paths.3. Introducing a self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from longer paths to shorter paths, enhancing the representation learned by the paths. 4. Showing the proposed path combination methods can help ViTs go deeper and have the effect of modulating frequency components.5. Demonstrating through experiments that both the path combination strategies and self-distillation can improve performance across different ViT models like DeiT and Swin Transformers.In summary, the key contribution is providing a new ensemble view of ViTs and using it to analyze path contributions, propose techniques to optimize path combinations, and design a self-distillation method. The view provides a new perspective to understand and improve Vision Transformers.
