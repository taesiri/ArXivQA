# [Latent Semantic Consensus For Deterministic Geometric Model Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Estimating reliable geometric model parameters from data with severe outliers is an important task in computer vision, but faces challenges due to the presence of multiple structures and outliers. Existing random sampling methods lack stability and consistency, while deterministic methods are limited to single structures or certain models. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Latent Semantic Consensus (LSC) approach for deterministic and multi-structural model fitting. The key ideas are:

1) Construct two Latent Semantic Spaces (LSS) - one for data points and one for model hypotheses. Inliers and good hypotheses get separated from outliers and bad hypotheses respectively. 

2) Iteratively refine sampling by preserving latent semantic consensus - remove outliers using LSS of points, generate hypotheses using neighbor information in LSS, remap points and hypotheses to update LSS, further remove outliers.

3) For model selection, cluster hypotheses in LSS into subspaces via an integer program, then select best hypothesis in each subspace. This simplifies model selection.

Main Contributions:

- A novel latent semantic consensus based deterministic sampling algorithm that handles general multi-structural data

- An effective model selection technique by formulating the problem as subspace recovery in LSS of hypotheses  

- State-of-the-art accuracy and speed for tasks like line fitting, homography estimation etc. on synthetic and real datasets

- Ability to provide consistent and reliable solutions for a variety of geometric model fitting problems

The proposed LSC framework outperforms other methods by leveraging latent semantic information to address limitations of existing approaches.
