# [NightHaze: Nighttime Image Dehazing via Self-Prior Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing nighttime image dehazing methods struggle to handle real-world nighttime haze images due to the significant domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world haze effects. They fail to reveal clear backgrounds, especially in challenging areas affected by low light, noise, and glow effects. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel nighttime image dehazing method called NightHaze with two main components:
  1) Self-prior learning: Inspired by MAE, it brings an MAE-like framework to learn strong priors resilient to real haze effects via severe augmentation on clear night images. The severe augmentation intentionally blends clear images with glow/light effects and adds noise. 
  2) Self-refinement: A teacher-student framework that further refines the network on real hazy images, using a confidence assessment strategy to prevent inaccurate knowledge transfer.

Main Contributions:
- Novel severe augmentation designed specifically for nighttime images by blending in light effects and noise to enable effective self-prior learning.
- Self-prior learning method that produces strong priors robust to real night haze, leading to significant visibility enhancement.  
- Self-refinement technique to adapt the model to real hazy data while avoiding inaccurate knowledge transfer.
- Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art nighttime dehazing techniques by a large margin quantitatively and qualitatively on real-world datasets. It recovers clearer backgrounds and reveals more details.

In summary, the paper addresses the problem of ineffective handling of real night haze images by existing methods through a novel approach with self-prior learning via tailored severe augmentation and self-refinement for robust performance on real data. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of NightHaze.
